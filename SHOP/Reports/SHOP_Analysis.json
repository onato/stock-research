  "overview": "Shopify is a leading global e-commerce platform company headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, providing SaaS tools and services for merchants to start, run, and grow their online and offline businesses. The company serves over 5 million active merchants globally across 175+ countries, processing nearly $300 billion in GMV in 2024. Shopify operates through two main revenue streams: Subscription Solutions (recurring SaaS platform fees) and Merchant Solutions (payments processing, shipping, capital, and other value-added services).",
  "business_model": {
    "summary": "Shopify operates an asset-light, high-margin SaaS model with recurring subscription revenue complemented by transaction-based merchant services. Merchant Solutions accounts for approximately 75% of total revenue, driven by Shopify Payments, while Subscription Solutions provides stable recurring income at approximately 25% of revenue. The company completed its transformation in 2023 by divesting its capital-intensive logistics business, resulting in improved profitability.",
