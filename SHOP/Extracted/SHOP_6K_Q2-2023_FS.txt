1.Nature of Business

Shopify Inc. ("Shopify" or the "Company") was incorporated as a Canadian corporation on September 28, 2004. Shopify is a leading provider of essential internet infrastructure for commerce, offering trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a platform and services that are engineered for simplicity and reliability, while delivering a better shopping experience for consumers everywhere. The Company's software enables merchants to run their business across all of their sales channels, including web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, social media storefronts, and marketplaces. The Shopify platform provides merchants with a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels and enables them to manage products and inventory, process orders and payments, fulfill and ship orders, build customer relationships, source products, leverage analytics and reporting, and access financing, all from one integrated back office.

Founded in Ottawa, Canada, the Company's principal place of business is the internet.


2.Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its directly and indirectly held wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been presented in United States dollars ("USD") and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), including the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of its financial position, results of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the interim periods. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2022. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 was derived from the audited annual financial statements, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements.
Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company began reporting all dollar amounts in millions.
The interim results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.


3.Significant Accounting Policies

Except for the additions to the equity and other investments accounting policy, which are discussed below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Equity and Other Investments

Strategic investments are a part of the Company's strategy and use of capital, expanding its expertise and building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.

•Equity and other investments in publicly traded companies with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair value are recognized into net (loss) income.
•Equity and other investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost less impairments, with subsequent adjustments for observable changes (referred to as the measurement alternative).
•Investments that qualify for the "equity method" of accounting treatment are carried at the Company’s investment amounts and adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and amortization of the basis difference, which is the difference between the fair value of our investment in the company and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee.

The Company evaluates each investment to determine if the investment should be accounted for as an equity method investment based upon equity ownership, significant influence and ongoing involvement in the investee, including factors such as representation on the investee's Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that the investment in Flexport, Inc. ("Flexport") is an equity method investment. The Company's share of income and loss in the investee will be presented as "net gain (loss) on equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

The Company assesses its equity method investment for impairment when events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the investment may be impaired, and the decline in value below the carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary.

The Company also evaluates each investment to determine if the investment is a variable interest entity and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The Company has determined, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 that there were no variable interest entities required to be consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company also holds investments in convertible notes of private companies which are classified as available-for-sale debt securities, for which the Company has elected to account for under the fair value option. The investments are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair values are recognized in net (loss) income.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the estimates made by management. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in these condensed consolidated financial statements include: key judgments related to revenue recognition in determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent to the arrangements with merchants; estimates of expected credit losses related to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including contract balances and loans and merchant cash advances; inputs used to fair value equity and other investments in private companies, including revenue growth rates, revenue multiples based on market comparables and a discount for lack of marketability; estimates and judgments involved in applying the measurement alternative associated with equity and other investments in private companies, including the Company's assessment to evaluate whether an investment is impaired through analyzing market conditions, business results and other qualitative measures and to measure the amount of that impairment, when applicable, by developing certain
8

(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)

key assumptions, including revenue growth rates, revenue multiples based on market comparables and a discount for lack of marketability; probabilities of achieving performance milestones associated with non-cash revenue consideration from strategic partnerships; and estimates involved in evaluating the probability and amount of loss contingencies.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans, merchant cash advances and related receivables, and foreign exchange derivative products subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. We limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct timely evaluations of the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables, and loans receivable and merchant cash advances. Trade and other receivables, and loans receivable and merchant cash advances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. The Company has mitigated some of the risks associated with Shopify Capital by opening insurance policies with Export Development Canada ("EDC"), a wholly-owned corporation of the Government of Canada, who is AAA rated as at June 30, 2023. The Company’s policies cover certain loans and merchant cash advances, subject under certain policies to minimum claim requirements and regional restrictions. The Company pays EDC a monthly premium based on total eligible dollars advanced, and records this as general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. All policies include a deductible set at either a specified dollar loss threshold or calculated as a percentage of eligible advances issued. After considering the Company’s deductible and the insurer's maximum liability under the policies, the majority of the Company's gross outstanding balance of loans and merchant cash advances as at June 30, 2023 is covered. The receivable related to insurance recoveries, if any, is included in the loans, merchant cash advances and related receivables balance. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables.

Equity and Other Investments Risk

The Company holds equity and other investments that are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. The Company's equity and other investments in public companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. The Company's equity investments in private companies are recorded using the measurement alternative and are assessed each reporting period for observable price changes and impairments, which may involve estimates and judgments given the lack of readily available market data. Certain equity investments in private companies are in the early stages of development and are inherently risky due to their lack of operational history. Furthermore, for the equity method investment, Shopify's share of income and loss from these investments may cause volatility to Shopify's earnings. The Company's debt investments in convertible notes of private companies are recorded at fair value, which are impacted by the underlying entities' valuations and interest rates.

The Company has a high concentration of credit risk associated with a small number of equity and other investments that are impacted by fluctuations in their fair values or by observable changes or impairments.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company's results of operations and foreign currency assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

While the majority of the Company's revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions, and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in British pound sterling ("GBP"), Euros ("EUR") and Canadian dollars ("CAD"). Furthermore, as the Company continues to have significant Canadian operations and as operations continue to expand internationally, a significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred in the aforementioned foreign currencies.

Although foreign currency fluctuations associated with revenues and costs may partially offset one another in earnings, the Company uses foreign exchange derivative products to mitigate a portion of the remaining exposure of foreign currency fluctuations as discussed in Note 5. By their nature, derivative financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of non-performance by counterparties.


4.Sales of Businesses

In the second quarter of 2023 the Company sold its logistics businesses (the "divested businesses"). The majority of the logistics business was sold to Flexport, a leading tech-driven global logistics platform. The Company received non-cash consideration in the form of a 13% equity interest on a fully-diluted basis inclusive of warrants and options.

The net assets of the divested businesses had an aggregate carrying amount above their estimated fair value and accordingly, an impairment loss was recorded in operating expenses as "impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The components of the sale were as follows:

The non-cash consideration was in addition to the Company's existing equity interest in Flexport, bringing Shopify's total ownership stake in Flexport to approximately 17% equity ownership on a fully-diluted basis inclusive of warrants and options as of June 30, 2023. The investment in Flexport is accounted for under the equity investment method (see Note 5).

5.Financial Instruments

Debt Securities

The Company holds certain debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity at the time of purchase as the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. The fair value of corporate bonds was based upon Level 2 inputs, which included period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.

The Company also holds debt securities in the form of convertible notes in private companies classified as available-for-sale for which the Company has elected to apply the fair value option. The fair values of the convertible notes in private companies were determined based on binomial pricing models for which the Company was required to develop its own assumptions, including the underlying entities' valuations.

The following tables summarize debt securities by significant investment classification and level within the fair value hierarchy:

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, $15 and $49, respectively, were transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 due to the vesting of warrants associated with an investment in a strategic partnership (June 30, 2022 - $47 and $135). The equity investments categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent Global-E unvested warrants that require the application of a discount for lack of marketability which was 15% at June 30, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - 9%).

(1) During the six months ended June 30, 2022, certain private investments were acquired by third-party investors resulting in the deemed sale of equity and other investments in the period. Any resulting realized gains or losses were presented as "net realized gain on equity and other investments" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
(2) During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company identified observable price changes resulting in the remeasurement of private investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company applied certain valuation methods based on information available, including the market approach and option pricing models in order to quantify the level of impairment recognized. The resulting unrealized losses and impairment were presented as "net unrealized gain (loss) on equity and other investments" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

As at June 30, 2023, included in the total $856 of equity and other investments without readily determinable fair values, $372 was remeasured at fair value and was classified within Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy on a non-recurring basis.

Equity Method Investment

Shopify holds an equity method investment which is presented within "equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is carried at the amount of the Shopify’s investment and is adjusted each period for Shopify’s share of the investee’s income or loss and the basis difference amortization, which is the difference between the fair value of our investment in the company and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee. Shopify's share of the investee’s income or loss and the basis difference amortization are reflected in Shopify's "net gain (loss) on equity method investment".

Due to the timing of availability in the reporting of financial information from the investee, results will be presented on a one-quarter lag and no share of the income or loss in the investee was reported in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

The current carrying value of the equity method investment includes multiple valuations done at different points in time, and as at June 30, 2023 was $838. As of December 31, 2022, Shopify's investment was not accounted for under the equity method and therefore the "equity method" investment was - $nil.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

As at June 30, 2023, the Company held foreign exchange forward contracts and options for USD, GBP and CAD with a total notional value of $519 (December 31, 2022 - $527), to fund a portion of its operations. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was based upon Level 2 inputs, which included period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial

institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.

Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges

The Company has a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows and earnings. Under this program, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and options with certain financial institutions and designated those hedges as cash flow hedges. The Company is hedging cash flows associated with payroll and facility costs.

The fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows:

Unbilled revenues represent amounts not yet billed related to subscription fees for Plus merchants, transaction fees, shipping charges, and partner referral fees as at the condensed consolidated balance sheet date.

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the unbilled revenues and trade receivables accounts. The Company determined the provision based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, supportable forecasts of collectibility and other currently available evidence.

The opening balances of total current and long-term deferred revenue were $217 and $163, respectively, as of January 1, 2022.

As at June 30, 2023, the long-term deferred revenue, excluding non-cash consideration received, will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of the contracts with the customers, which range from two to three years.

The Company has received non-cash consideration in the form of equity investments in exchange for services to be rendered as part of strategic partnerships. As the Company is required to provide referral services and other services to support the partners' merchant offerings over the period of the performance obligations, revenue is deferred and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the expected terms of the contracts. Within total deferred revenue outlined above, non-cash consideration represents a significant portion of the balance as at June 30, 2023.

The table below summarizes the gross changes in deferred revenue associated with this non-cash consideration received for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

The Company maintains an internal monitoring list related to its outstanding loans. A merchant's ability and willingness to repay the financing receivables outstanding under the program is analyzed for a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: current or expected age of the financing, merchant subscription or financing status, merchant GMV trends and other changes to merchant credit profiles. In March 2023, the Company modified its charge off policy to charging off receivables outstanding under the program when the merchant receivable is included on its internal monitoring list for a period of 150 consecutive days (previously 90 consecutive days).

For certain Shopify Capital loans, there is a fixed maximum repayment term. For certain other Shopify Capital loans, the Company calculates an expected repayment date. Using the merchant's contractual or expected repayment date, the Company calculates an effective interest rate based on the merchant's expected future payment volume to determine how much of a merchant's repayment to recognize as revenue and how much to apply against the merchant's receivable balance. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 $37 and $56, respectively, of revenue recognized as merchant solutions revenue required the application of an effective interest rate, per ASC 310 (June 30, 2022 - $9 and $15) .

11.Convertible Senior Notes

In September 2020, the Company issued $920 aggregate principal amount of 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $908 after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs.

The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms.

The Notes have a conversion rate of 6.9440 Class A subordinate voting shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $144.01 per share, adjusted to give effect to the Share Split. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment following the occurrence of certain specified events, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional Class A subordinate voting shares for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the relevant redemption period.

The Company accounts for the Notes as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes, less total offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs. Total offering costs upon issuance of the Notes were $12 and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the Notes. Interest expense is recognized at an annual effective interest rate of 0.38% over the contractual term of the Notes.

The net carrying amount of the outstanding Notes was as follows:

As at June 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $835 (December 31, 2022 - $783). The estimated fair value was determined based on the last executed trade for the Notes of the reporting period in an over-the-counter market, which is considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.


12.Credit Facility

The Company has a revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada for $8 CAD. The credit facility bears interest at the Royal Bank Prime Rate plus 0.30%. As at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the effective rate was 7.25% and 6.75%, respectively, and no cash amounts were drawn under this credit facility.


13.Litigation and Loss Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may become a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims, labour and employment claims and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax and other matters.

On August 31, 2022, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware returned a verdict finding that the Company infringed three web technology patents owned by Express Mobile, Inc. The Company has challenged the verdict through post-trial motions and the Plaintiff has moved for interest on the amount of the verdict.

The Company currently has no other known material pending litigation or claims. The Company is not aware of any other litigation matters or loss contingencies that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $4 and $8 (June 30, 2022 - $4 and $7), respectively, from the private company for referral services.

17.Income Taxes

The Company's provision for, or recovery of, income taxes is determined by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to income or loss from recurring operations and adding the effects of any discrete income tax items specific to the period.

The Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate each quarter and makes cumulative adjustments if its estimated annual tax rate changes. The Company’s effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the
