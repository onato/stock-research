Merchant Success Drives Shopify's Excellent Q1 - Delivering Strong Revenue Growth AND Profitability

Internet, Everywhere - May 8, 2025 - Shopify Inc. (NASDAQ, TSX: SHOP) announced today financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. Shopify achieved 27% revenue growth and 15% free cash flow margin. Shopify has now delivered double-digit free cash flow margins for seven consecutive quarters.

"Our Q1 results confirm two clear facts. First, we are delivering both growth and profitability at scale. Second, businesses perform better on Shopify, regardless of market conditions," said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. "We built Shopify for times like these. We handle the complexity so merchants can focus on their customers. We ship products faster than anyone else, giving merchants the edge they need to succeed."

Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify, added, "Q1 marked another very strong set of financial results for Shopify, with 27% revenue growth and 15% free cash flow margin. We have now achieved eight consecutive quarters of pro forma revenue growth of 25% or more and seven consecutive quarters of GMV growth greater than 20%, all while increasing our free cash flow. These metrics highlight our strong performance and dedication to supporting our merchants' success."(1)

(3) Net other expense, including taxes includes interest income, gains and losses on equity and other investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, and our provision for income taxes.

(4) Net income excluding the impact of equity investments is a non-GAAP financial measure which is reconciled at the end of this press release. The impact of any gains or losses on our equity investments in third parties are not relevant to the fundamentals of our business. Valuations of third parties in public and private markets are outside of our control, and therefore, fluctuations in those valuations have little analytical or predictive value regarding our ability to drive operational results.

Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking statements”), including statements related to Shopify’s financial outlook, such as expected revenue and expenses for the next fiscal quarter. These statements can be identified by words such as “expect” and are based on Shopify's current projections and expectations about future events and financial results. Known and unknown risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to maintain expected growth and manage expenses, the impact of changes in economic conditions and consumer spending in key markets such as the United States and Europe and globally, the impact of measures that affect international trade, including tariffs, our reliance on third party cloud providers to deliver services, a cyberattack or security breach, and serious errors or defects in software or hardware. Other factors and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements are set out in Shopify's Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and other filings made with US and Canadian securities regulators, available at www.sec.gov and www.sedarplus.ca. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to management on the date hereof and represent management’s beliefs regarding future events, projection and financial trends, which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. The forward-looking statements are provided to give additional information about management’s expectations and beliefs and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Shopify undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.


















Endnotes:
Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty, and value-added taxes.

Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

Free cash flow and free cash flow margin are non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of this press release. Shopify believes free cash flow and free cash flow margin provide useful information to help investors and others understand our operating results and the performance of our business in the same manner as management. Shopify does not reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP free cash flow margin as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.
