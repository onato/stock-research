Shopify Inc.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)
(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)
1.Nature of Business

Shopify Inc. ("Shopify" or the "Company") was incorporated on September 28, 2004. Shopify is a leading global commerce company that provides essential internet infrastructure for commerce, offering trusted tools to start, scale, market, and run a business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a software platform and services that are engineered for simplicity and reliability, while delivering a better shopping experience for consumers everywhere. The Company's software enables merchants to run their business across all of their sales channels, including web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, social media storefronts, and marketplaces. The Shopify platform provides merchants with a single view of their business across all of their sales channels and enables them to manage products and inventory, process orders and payments, fulfill and ship orders, build customer relationships, source products, leverage analytics and reporting, and access financing, all from one integrated back office.

The Company's principal place of business is the internet.


2.Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its directly and indirectly held wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been presented in U.S. dollars ("USD") and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), including the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of its financial position, results of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the interim periods. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited annual financial statements, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements.
The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.


3.Significant Accounting Policies

There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the estimates made by management. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in these condensed consolidated financial statements include: key judgments related to revenue recognition in determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent to the arrangements with merchants; estimates and judgments involved in applying the measurement alternative associated with equity and other investments in private

companies, including revenue growth rates and revenue multiples based on market comparables; estimates involved in our equity method investment; probabilities of achieving performance milestones associated with non-cash revenue consideration from strategic partnerships; and the probability and amount of loss contingencies.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans, merchant cash advances, and foreign exchange derivative instruments subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. We limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct timely evaluations of the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables, and loans receivable and merchant cash advances. Trade and other receivables, and loans receivable and merchant cash advances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. The Company has mitigated some of the risks associated with Shopify Capital by holding insurance policies with an AAA rated provider as of September 30, 2024. The Company pays a monthly premium based on total eligible dollars advanced, and records this as "General and administrative" expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). All policies include a deductible set at either a specified dollar loss threshold or calculated as a percentage of eligible advances issued. After considering the Company’s deductible and the insurer's maximum liability under the policies, the majority of the Company's gross outstanding balance of loans and merchant cash advances as of September 30, 2024 is covered. The receivable related to insurance recoveries, if any, is included in "Loans and merchant cash advances, net" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables.

Equity and Other Investments Risk

The Company holds equity and other investments that are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. The Company's equity and other investments in public companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. The Company also holds an investment option to purchase Series B common shares in Klaviyo, Inc., which is accounted for as a derivative instrument and valued using the Black-Scholes model, and is subject to market price volatility as well as a discount for lack of marketability. The Company's equity investments in private companies are recorded using the measurement alternative and are assessed each reporting period for observable price changes and impairments, which may involve estimates and judgments given the lack of readily available market data. Certain equity investments in private companies are in the early stages of development and are inherently risky due to their lack of operational history. Furthermore, for the equity method investment, Shopify's share of income and loss from these investments may cause volatility to Shopify's earnings. The Company's debt investments in convertible notes of private companies are recorded at fair value, which are impacted by the underlying entities' valuations and interest rates.

The Company has a high concentration of risk associated with a small number of equity and other investments that are impacted by fluctuations in their fair values or by observable changes or impairments.

(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company's results of operations and foreign currency assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

While the majority of the Company's revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in British pound sterling ("GBP"), Euros, and Canadian dollars ("CAD"). Furthermore, a significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred in the aforementioned foreign currencies.

Although foreign currency fluctuations associated with revenues and costs may partially offset one another in earnings, the Company uses foreign exchange derivative products to mitigate a portion of the remaining exposure of foreign currency fluctuations as discussed in Note 4. By their nature, derivative financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of non-performance by counterparties.


4.Financial Instruments

The Company measures financial instruments based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), inputs from similar instruments such as quoted prices or other observable market data (Level 2), or where little or no market activity exists, using unobservable inputs that require judgment or estimation (Level 3).

Debt Securities

The Company holds certain debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity at the time of purchase as the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. The fair value of corporate bonds are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.

The Company also holds debt securities in the form of convertible notes in private companies classified as available-for-sale for which the Company has elected to apply the fair value option. The investments are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair values are recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Results are reported with a one-quarter delay due to the timing of financial information availability from the investee. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 our share of the loss in the investee for the period was $28 and $116 (September 30, 2023 - $10 and $10), and is presented within "Net loss on equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

The opening balances of current and long-term deferred revenue were $296 and $268, respectively, as of January 1, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, the long-term deferred revenue, excluding non-cash consideration received, will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of the contracts with the customers, which range from two to three years.

The Company has received non-cash consideration in the form of equity investments in exchange for services to be rendered as part of strategic partnerships. As the Company is required to provide referral services and other services to support the partners' merchant offerings over the period of the performance obligations, revenue is deferred and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the expected terms of the contracts.

The table below summarizes the gross changes in deferred revenue associated with this non-cash consideration received for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

8.Convertible Senior Notes

In September 2020, the Company issued $920 aggregate principal amount of 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $908 after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs.

The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms.

The Notes have a conversion rate of 6.9440 Class A subordinate voting shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $144.01 per share, adjusted to give effect to the share split effected in June 2022. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment following the occurrence of certain specified events, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional Class A subordinate voting shares for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the relevant redemption period.

The Company accounts for the Notes as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes, less total offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs. Total offering costs upon issuance of the Notes were $12 and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the Notes. Interest expense is recognized at an annual effective interest rate of 0.38% over the contractual term of the Notes.

The net carrying amount of the outstanding Notes was as follows:

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $nil and $1 (September 30, 2023 - $nil and $1), respectively, of contractual interest expense, and recognized $nil and $1 (September 30, 2023 - $1 and $2) of amortization of offering costs, related to the outstanding Notes.

As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $886 (December 31, 2023 - $865). The estimated fair value was determined based on the last executed trade for the Notes of the reporting period in an over-the-counter market, which is considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.


9.Credit Facility

The Company has a revolving credit facility with RBC for $8 CAD. The credit facility bears interest at the RBC prime rate plus 0.30%. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the effective rate was 6.75% and 7.50%, respectively, and no cash amounts were drawn under this credit facility.

10.Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may become a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims, labour and employment claims and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax and other matters.

In the third quarter of 2022, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware returned a verdict finding that the Company infringed three web technology patents owned by Express Mobile, Inc. and the Company recorded an estimated liability in that period for damages and potential interest of $55 million. The Company filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. In the second quarter of 2024, the court granted that motion, vacating the jury verdict in its entirety and mooting the plantiff's motion for pre- and post-judgement interest.

As a result of this decision, the Company has reversed the previously recorded liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 within "General and administrative" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss), as a loss contingency was no longer considered probable.

The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably estimable. From time to time, the Company may become a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims, labour and employment claims and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax and other matters. The Company currently has no material pending litigation or claims. The Company is not aware of any litigation matters or loss contingencies that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


11.Related Parties

The Company has a commercial agreement with Flexport, a company in which it has an equity method investment. The Company earns a share of revenues for orders processed or otherwise sent through services provided by Shopify. The Company recognized $nil revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to this agreement. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company commenced a separate agreement with Flexport to provide co-marketing services for the coordinated marketing of fulfillment-related products and services to current and prospective merchants. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $nil and $2, respectively, of expense related to this agreement in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company also holds a convertible note in Flexport which is classified within "Equity and other investments'' in the consolidated balance sheets, which is being accounted for using the fair value option. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $8 and $24, respectively, of interest income related to the convertible note within "Interest income" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).


12.Shareholders’ Equity

Employee Compensation System

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company added a long-term equity component to its Flex Comp program. The Flex Comp program was launched in 2022, providing employees with a dollar-denominated annual compensation amount ("Wallet Value") that can be allocated between cash, stock options and RSUs on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the employees, subject to certain restrictions around minimum allocations of cash and stock-based compensation. The long-term equity component allows employees to allocate a portion of their Wallet Value to RSUs, stock options, or a combination of both that, in each case, would vest monthly over a three year period. Initially, the Flex Comp program only included a short-term equity component, with awards that vested monthly over a three month period.

14.Income Taxes

The Company's provision for, or recovery of, income taxes is determined by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to income or loss from recurring operations and adding the effects of any discrete income tax items specific to the period.

The Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate each quarter and makes cumulative adjustments if its estimated annual tax rate changes. The Company’s effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition and derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where the Company conducts business.

The Company had a provision for income taxes of $32 and $81 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily on account of earnings in jurisdictions outside of North America (September 30, 2023 - $10 and $28).

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance efforts with respect to the global minimum tax framework ("Pillar Two"). On June 20, 2024, Canada enacted legislation in accordance with the Pillar Two framework. Many countries have also enacted or are expected to enact Pillar Two legislation. The Company continues to monitor the development and implementation of these rules both in local countries and on a multilateral basis, making it uncertain to predict the ultimate impact in the future. There is no material impact to the consolidated financial statements and results of operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

15.Net Income (Loss) per Share

The Company applies the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share as Class A subordinate voting shares and Class B restricted voting shares are participating securities with equal participation rights and are entitled to receive dividends on a share for share basis. The Company uses the treasury stock method and if-converted method for calculating the effect of dilutive potential common stock from employee stock options and employee RSUs and from its Notes, respectively.

The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding:
