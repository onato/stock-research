1.Nature of Business

Shopify Inc. (“Shopify” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a Canadian corporation on September 28, 2004. Shopify is a leading global commerce company, providing trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a platform and services that are engineered for reliability, while delivering a better shopping experience for buyers everywhere. Merchants use the Company's software to run their business across all of their sales channels, including web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, social media storefronts, and marketplaces. The Shopify platform provides merchants with a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels and enables them to manage products and inventory, process orders and payments, fulfill and ship orders, build customer relationships, source products, leverage analytics and reporting, and access financing, all from one integrated back office.

Founded in Ottawa, Canada, the Company's principal place of business is the internet.


2.Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its directly and indirectly held wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been presented in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.

In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position, results of operations and comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for the interim periods. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2020. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 was derived from the audited annual financial statements, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements.

The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.


3.Significant Accounting Policies

Except for the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, which is discussed below, and the fair value of the Company's investment in Affirm Holdings, Inc. ("Affirm") being readily determinable, as described in note 5, there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Debt - Accounting for Convertible Instruments

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity, which eliminates certain models associated with accounting for convertible instruments, makes targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings per share guidance, and amends the guidance for the derivative scope exception for contracts in an

entity's own equity. The updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those periods. The Company early adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption eliminated the requirement to separately account for the liability and equity components of its 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the "Notes"), which existed under previous accounting guidance. This results in a reclassification of $158,810 from additional paid-in capital to long-term liabilities. Furthermore, as a result of the adoption, non-cash interest expense related to the Company's currently outstanding Notes has been eliminated. As the Company previously recognized non-cash interest expense relating to the debt discount on the liability component, this results in a $8,198 cumulative adjustment to increase opening retained earnings.

The Company accounts for the Notes at amortized cost as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes, less debt offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs. Offering costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in these condensed consolidated financial statements include: key judgments related to revenue recognition in determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent to the arrangements with merchants; estimates of expected credit losses related to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including contract balances and merchant cash advances and loans; inputs used to fair value acquired intangible assets; estimates involved in evaluating the recoverability of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements, including, but not limited to, the estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements; and the incremental borrowing rate applied to lease payments. Actual results may differ from the estimates made by management.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, merchant cash advances, loans and related receivables, and foreign exchange derivative products subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables and merchant cash advances and loans receivable. Trade and other receivables and merchant cash advances and loans receivable are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. The Company has mitigated some of the risks associated with Shopify Capital by entering into an agreement with a third party that insures a portion of the merchant cash advances and loans offered by Shopify Capital. The receivable related to insurance recoveries is included in the merchant cash advances, loans and related receivables balance. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables. Potential ongoing effects from the novel coronavirus "COVID-19" pandemic on the Company's credit risk have been considered and have resulted in adjustments to the Company's allowances for expected credit losses on contract balances and merchant cash advances and loans, as discussed in notes 6 and 7, respectively. The Company continues its assessment given the fluidity of COVID-19's global impact.

Interest Rate Risk

Certain of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and loans earn interest. The Company’s trade and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lease liabilities do not bear interest. The Company's Notes have a fixed annual interest rate and thus, the Company does not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. The Company is not exposed to material interest rate risk.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar (CAD) and the USD. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on the revaluation of foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company uses foreign exchange derivative products to manage the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. By their nature, derivative financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of non-performance by counter parties.

While the majority of the Company's revenues and cost of revenues are denominated in USD, a significant portion of operating expenses are incurred in CAD. As a result, earnings are adversely affected by an increase in the value of the CAD relative to the USD.

The following table summarizes the effects on revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses, and income (loss) from operations of a 10% strengthening(1) of the CAD versus the USD without considering the impact of the Company's hedging activities and without factoring in any potential changes in demand for the Company's solutions as a result of changes in the CAD to USD exchange rates.

The fair values above include accrued interest of $7,563, which is excluded from the carrying amounts. The accrued interest is included in Trade and other receivables in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

All cash equivalents and marketable securities mature within one year of the condensed consolidated balance sheet date.

As at March 31, 2021, the Company held foreign exchange forward contracts to convert USD into CAD, with a total notional value of $374,936 (December 31, 2020 - $340,843), to fund a portion of its operations. The foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and corporate bonds was based upon Level 2 inputs, which included period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company has a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows and earnings. Under this program, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with certain financial institutions and designated those hedges as cash flow hedges. As of March 31, 2021, $12,742 of unrealized gains and $108 of unrealized losses related to changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were included in accumulated other comprehensive income and current assets and current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, $9,154 of realized gains (March 31, 2020 - $1,295 of realized losses) related to the maturity of foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were included in cost of revenues and operating expenses. Under the current hedging program, the Company is hedging cash flows associated with payroll and facility costs.

Convertible Senior Notes

As at March 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company's Notes, as further described in note 10 below, was approximately $1,053,096. The estimated fair value was determined based on the last executed trade for the Notes of the reporting period in an over-the-counter market, which is considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.


5.Equity and Other Investments

Strategic investments are a part of the Company's strategy and use of capital, expanding our expertise and building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. The Company holds equity and other investments in public companies with readily determinable fair values, as well as in private companies without readily determinable fair values. Equity and other investments in public companies with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair value are recognized into income. Equity and other investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost less impairments, with subsequent adjustments for observable changes (referred to as the measurement alternative).

In July 2020, the Company received an investment in Affirm in conjunction with its strategic partnership for Shop Pay Installments. As at December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Company’s investment was $158,000. On January 13, 2021, Affirm completed its initial public offering and began trading on the Nasdaq. As a result, the fair value of the investment became readily determinable (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and the use of the measurement alternative was no longer applicable. As at March 31, 2021, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Affirm was $1,435,446 measured using Affirm's closing share price on the last day of trading of the reporting period. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, an unrealized gain of $1,277,294 was recorded within other income in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Adjustments related to equity and other investments with readily determinable fair values in the three months ended March 31, 2021 were as follows:

(1) Effective January 13, 2021, the Company's investment in Affirm no longer qualified for the use of the measurement alternative as the fair value of the investment became readily determinable.

For the Company's equity and other investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values, the carrying amount of such investments as at March 31, 2021 was $195,504 (December 31, 2020 - $173,454). For the three months ended March 31, 2021, net unrealized losses of $26,350 relating to these investments were recorded within other income in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company made two separate investments totaling $200,000 in a private company, that is a partner in its ecosystem, without readily determinable fair values, which are currently accounted for using the measurement alternative. Subsequent to the closing of the first investment, the second investment represented an observable transaction and resulted in the recognition of a $26,722 unrealized loss on the first investment.

8.Leases

The Company has office leases in Canada, the United States, Singapore, Ireland and other countries in Europe and Asia. These leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years. Additional office space leases are set to commence between 2021 and 2026, at which point the Company's right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will increase. The Company has entered into various lease agreements for office space that are set to commence after March 31, 2021, which will create significant right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. All of the Company's leases are operating leases.

The components of lease expense were as follows:

As at March 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term is 9 years and the weighted average discount rate is 4.2% (December 31, 2020 - 9 years and 4.4%, respectively).
    
During the year ended December 31, 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company decided to move from a primarily physical office-centric work model to a primarily digital work-from-home-centric work model. The Company plans to keep, but repurpose certain office locations to support the new model and terminate or sublet other office locations that it ceases to use.

With respect to certain office locations expected to be kept, but repurposed, the Company has recognized accelerated depreciation of certain leasehold improvements and furniture in order to reflect changes that it plans to make to accommodate greater physical distancing and increased team onsite meeting spaces. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company identified $40,457 of leasehold improvements and furniture that will be accelerated over a 2 to 3 year period as the Company retrofits its existing offices.

10.Convertible Senior Notes

In September 2020, the Company issued $920,000 aggregate principal amount of 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2025. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $907,950 after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs.

The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms.

The Notes will have an initial conversion rate of 0.6944 Class A subordinate voting shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $1,440.09 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment following the occurrence of certain specified events, as set out or defined in the Trust indenture agreement for the Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, as set out or defined in the Trust indenture agreement for the Notes, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional Class A subordinate voting shares for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the relevant redemption period.

15


Shopify Inc.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)
Expressed in US $000's except share and per share amounts
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2025, the Notes may be convertible at the option of the holders only under the following circumstances:

(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2021, and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Class A subordinate voting shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Notes on each applicable trading day;

(2) during the ten business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per one thousand dollars principal amount of Notes for each trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Class A subordinate voting shares on the NYSE and the conversion rate for the Notes on each such trading day;

(3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes for optional redemption, clean-up redemption or tax redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or

(4) upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events.

On or after August 1, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Notes may, at their option, convert all or any portion of their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions.

Upon conversion, the Company can elect to settle in cash, Class A subordinate voting shares, or a combination of cash and Class A subordinate voting shares.

On or after September 15, 2023, the Company may, at its option, redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes if the last reported sale price of the Company's Class A subordinate voting shares on the NYSE has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No "sinking fund" is provided for the Notes.

The Company may redeem for cash all, but not less than all, of the Notes at any time if less than $80,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding at such time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The Company may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes if the Company has or would become obligated to pay to the holder of any Note additional amounts (which are more than a de minimis amount) as a result of a change in applicable Canadian tax laws or regulations after September 15, 2020 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any) to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date but without reduction for applicable Canadian taxes (except in respect of certain excluded holders).

Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as set out or defined in the Trust indenture agreement for the Notes) prior to the maturity date of the Notes, the Company, subject to limited exceptions, will be required to offer to purchase all of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount

thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.

The Notes are governed by customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future unsecured liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively subordinated to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of current or future subsidiaries of the Company.

The Company accounts for the Notes as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes, less total offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs. Total offering costs upon issuance of the Notes were $12,050 and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the Notes. Interest expense is recognized at an annual effective interest rate of 0.38% over the contractual term of the Notes.

The net carrying amount of the outstanding Notes was as follows:

15.Income Taxes

The Company's provision for, or recovery of, income taxes is determined by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to income or loss from recurring operations and adding the effects of any discrete income tax items specific to the period. The Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate each quarter and makes cumulative adjustments if its estimated annual tax rate changes.

The Company’s effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition and derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where the Company conducts business.

Expressed in US $000's except share and per share amounts


During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company released a portion of the valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets in Canada due to the unrealized gain on the Company’s investment in Affirm (see note 5).

As a result of the unrealized gain on equity and other investments, ongoing operations, other discrete items, primarily related to tax benefits for share-based compensation, the Company's ability to carry-back losses to prior years in Canada, and the recognition of deferred tax assets in Canada, the Company has a provision for income taxes of $111,099 in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and had a recovery of income taxes of $28,695 in the three months ended March 31, 2020.
