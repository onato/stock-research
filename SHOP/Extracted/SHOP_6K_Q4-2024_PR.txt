Internet, Everywhere - February 11, 2025 - Shopify Inc. (NYSE, TSX: SHOP), a leading commerce technology company announced today financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.

“2024 was a stand-out year for Shopify. We seized every opportunity to fuel our growth and it showed in the results quarter after quarter,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “Heading into 2025, we are committed to making entrepreneurship more common and further establishing Shopify as the go-to commerce platform for businesses of all sizes. With our proven track record, the agility of our platform, and our relentless focus on merchant success, we like our odds in this evolving technology landscape, and are excited about the opportunities it brings for Shopify and our merchants.”

2025 Outlook
The outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify’s control. Please see "Forward-looking Statements" below for more information.

We expect the strong merchant momentum from Q4 to carry over into Q1, recognizing that Q1 is consistently our lowest GMV quarter seasonally. With that backdrop, for the first-quarter of 2025 we expect:
•Revenue to grow at a mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;
•Gross profit dollars to grow at a low-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;
•Operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;
•Stock-based compensation to be $120 million; and
•Free cash flow margin to be in the mid-teens.

Quarterly Conference Call
Shopify’s management team will hold a conference call to discuss our fourth-quarter results today, February 11, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The conference call will be webcast on the investor relations section of Shopify’s website at www.shopifyinvestors.com/news-and-events. An archived replay of the webcast will be available following the conclusion of the call.

Shopify’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, including the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, Management's Discussion and Analysis, will be available on Shopify’s website at www.shopify.com and will be filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.

Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking statements”), including statements related to Shopify’s financial outlook, including expected revenue and expenses for the next fiscal quarter. These statements can be identified by words such as “expect” and are based on Shopify's current projections and expectations about future events and financial results. Known and unknown risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to maintain expected growth and manage expenses, the impact of changes in economic conditions and consumer spending in key markets such as the United States and Europe and globally, the impact of measures that affect international trade, including tariffs, our reliance on third party cloud providers to deliver services, a cyberattack or security breach, and serious errors or defects in software or hardware. Other factors and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements are set out in Shopify's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings made with US and Canadian securities regulators, available at www.sedarplus.ca and www.sec.gov. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to management on the date hereof and represent management’s beliefs regarding future events, projection and financial trends, which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. The forward-looking statements are provided to give additional information about management’s expectations and beliefs and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Shopify undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.


















Notes: (1)Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.

Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

Free cash flow and free cash flow margin are non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of this press release. Shopify believes free cash flow and free cash flow margin provide useful information to help investors and others understand our operating results and the performance of our business in the same manner as management. Shopify does not reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP free cash flow margin as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.
