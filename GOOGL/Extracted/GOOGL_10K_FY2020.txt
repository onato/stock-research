Non-marketable Equity Securities Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either fair value under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value measured cost, less any impairment, plus minus changes resulting from observable price changes orderly transactions for the identical similar investment the same issuer. Determining whether observed transaction similar security within our portfolio requires judgment based the rights and obligations the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments the carrying value our equity securities result observable price changes requires quantitative assessments the fair value our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use estimates. Non-marketable equity securities are also subject periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have significant effect the investment's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the companies' financial and liquidity position, access capital resources and the time since the last adjustment fair value, among others. When indicators impairment exist, prepare quantitative assessments the fair value our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data private and public companies, among others.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk transact business globally multiple currencies. Our international revenues, well costs and expenses denominated foreign currencies, expose the risk fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, considered the historical trends foreign currency exchange rates and determined that was reasonably possible that adverse changes exchange rates 10% could experienced the near term. use foreign exchange forward contracts offset the foreign exchange risk our assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the functional currency the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses the assets and liabilities are recorded other income (expense), net, which are offset the gains and losses the forward contracts. adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated currencies other than the functional currencies the balance sheet date, would have resulted adverse effect income before income taxes approximately million and $497 million Table Contents Alphabet Inc.

When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements. designate these contracts cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. reflect the gains losses foreign currency spot rate changes component AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues offset the hedged exposures they occur. the U.S. dollar weakened 10% December 31, 2019 and 2020, the amount recorded AOCI related our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $1.1 billion and $912 million lower December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The change the value recorded AOCI would expected offset corresponding foreign currency change forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. use foreign exchange forward contracts designated net investment hedges hedge the foreign currency risks related our investment foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations. the U.S. dollar weakened 10%, the amount recorded cumulative translation adjustment ("CTA") within AOCI related our net investment hedge would have been approximately $936 million and billion lower December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The change value recorded CTA would expected offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain loss from our investment foreign subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy achieve return that will allow preserve capital and maintain liquidity. invest primarily debt securities including those the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued foreign governments. policy, limit the amount credit exposure any one issuer. Our investments both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry degree interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due rise interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted interest rates fall. Unrealized gains losses our marketable debt securities are primarily due interest rate fluctuations compared interest rates the time purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, have elected the fair value option for which changes fair value are recorded other income (expense), net. measure securities for which have not elected the fair value option fair value with gains and losses recorded AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. use value-at-risk ("VaR") analysis determine the potential effect fluctuations interest rates the value our marketable debt security portfolio.

The estimated one-day loss fair value our marketable debt securities December 31, 2019 and 2020 are shown below (in millions): December 31, 12-Month Average December 31, 2019 2020 2019 2020 Risk Category Interest Rate 104 144 145 Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed December 31, 2019 and 2020 due the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount changes interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis not intended represent actual losses but used risk estimation. Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject wide variety market-related risks that could substantially reduce increase the fair value our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments privately held companies, some which are the startup development stages. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method fair value based readily determinable market values, which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject market price volatility, and represent $3.3 billion and $5.9 billion our investments December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. hypothetical adverse price change 30% our December 31, 2020 balance, which could experienced the near term, would decrease the fair value our marketable equity securities $1.8 billion. From time time, may enter into derivatives hedge the market price risk certain our marketable equity securities. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted fair value for observable transactions for identical similar investments the same issuer impairment (referred the measurement alternative). The fair value measured the time the observable transaction not necessarily indication the current fair value the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies products these companies have under development are typically the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience decline financial condition, which could result loss substantial part our investment these companies. The success our investment any private company also typically dependent the likelihood our ability realize appreciation the value our investments through liquidity events such public offerings, acquisitions, private sales other market events. December 31, 2019 and 2020, the carrying value our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $11.4 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. Valuations our equity investments private companies are inherently more complex due the lack readily available market data. Volatility the global economic climate and financial markets could result significant impairment charge relating our non-marketable equity securities. Changes valuation non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes valuation marketable equity securities. Additionally, observable transactions lower valuations could result significant losses our non-marketable equity securities. The effect COVID-19 our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due the uncertainty around the duration and severity the impact. The carrying values our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, generally not fluctuate based market price changes, however these investments could impaired the carrying value exceeds the fair value and not expected recover.
