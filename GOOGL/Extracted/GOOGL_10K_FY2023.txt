RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price our Class and Class stock. Risks Specific our Company generate significant portion our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending advertisers, loss partners, new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability customize ads could harm our business. generated more than 75% total revenues from online advertising 2023. Many our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with any time. These partners may not continue business with not create more value (such increased numbers users customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such our initiatives phase out third-party cookies, well changes other companies&#8217; advertising and/or data privacy practices have the past, and may the future, affect the advertising that are able provide. addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, that block the display ads altogether, and some providers online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality third-party digital advertising. Failing provide superior value deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. addition, expenditures advertisers tend correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting fluctuations the amounts our advertisers spend advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. face intense competition. not continue innovate and provide products and services that are useful users, customers, and other partners, may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business environment rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions rival products and services. compete successfully, must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies timely manner. our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure innovate will encompass wider range products and services. must continue invest significant resources technical infrastructure and R&D, including through acquisitions, order enhance our technology, products, and services. have many competitors different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well-established relationships various sectors. They can use their experience and resources ways that could affect our competitive position, including making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements; continuing invest heavily technical infrastructure, R&D, and talent; initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether not meritorious); and continuing compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies enforcement existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also able innovate and provide products and services faster than can may foresee the need for products and services before do. are expanding our investment across the entire company. This includes generative and continuing integrate capabilities into our products and services. technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, meet the changing needs and expectations our existing users and attract new users. Our ability deploy certain technologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend the availability and pricing third-party equipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop products and technologies that are similar superior our technologies more cost-effective deploy. Other companies may also have (or the future may obtain) patents other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, interfere with our ability make, use, sell our own products and services. Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer our products and services are not responsive the evolving needs and desires our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. new and existing technologies continue develop, competitors and new entrants may able offer experiences that are, 11. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. that are seen be, substantially similar better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage our products and services, and force compete different ways and expend significant resources develop and operate equal better products and services. Competitors&#8217; success providing compelling products and services attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results. Our ongoing investment new businesses, products, services, and technologies inherently risky, and could divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. have invested and expect continue invest new businesses, products, services, and technologies wide range industries beyond online advertising. The investments that are making across our businesses, such building capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts innovate and provide products and services that are helpful users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments ultimately may not commercially viable may not result adequate return capital and, pursuing new strategies, may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations our products and services could also result changes user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion resources and management attention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use alternative investment, governance, compensation structures that may fail adequately align incentives across the company otherwise accomplish their objectives. Within Google Services, continue invest heavily devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which highly competitive market with frequent introduction new products and services, rapid adoption technological advancements competitors, increased market saturation developed countries, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity the part consumers and businesses. There can assurance will able provide devices that compete effectively. Within Google Cloud, devote significant resources develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and are advancing our platforms and models support these tools and technologies. are incurring costs build and maintain infrastructure support cloud computing services, invest cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly support and scale our sales force. the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and may not attain sufficient scale and profitability achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, may subject government audits and cost reviews, and any failure comply any deficiencies found may expose legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners deliver localized services other countries, and may not able meet sovereign operating requirements. Within Other Bets, are investing significantly the areas health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, many which involve the development new and emerging technologies, may not successful, able compete effectively operate sufficient levels profitability. addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all these investment areas are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and may experience downward pressure our operating margin the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including changes the devices and modalities used access our products and services; changes geographic mix; deceleration declines advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases our pricing our products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts lower priced products and services. addition, may experience downward pressure our operating margin resulting from variety factors, such increase the mix lower-margin products and services, particular from the continued expansion our business into new fields, including products and services such our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer subscription products, well significant investments Other Bets, all which may have margins lower than those generate from advertising. particular, margins our devices have had, and may continue have, adverse effect our consolidated margins due pressures pricing and higher cost sales. may also experience 12. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. downward pressure our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects our business. Further, certain our costs and expenses are generally less variable nature and may not correlate changes revenue. may also not able execute our efforts re-engineer our cost base successfully timely manner. Due these factors and the evolving nature our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not indicative our future performance. For additional information, see Trends Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics Part II, Item this Annual Report Form 10-K. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability protect them could reduce the value our products, services, and brands well affect our ability compete. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside our control pose threat our intellectual property rights, well our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which our products and services are distributed made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts have taken protect our proprietary rights may not sufficient effective. Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. There always the possibility that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy such trade secrets and other sensitive information could compromised, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word &#8220;Google&#8221; could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word &#8220;search.&#8221; Some courts have ruled that "Google" protectable trademark, but possible that other courts, particularly those outside the U.S., may reach different determination. this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word &#8220;Google&#8221; refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming. Any increase the unauthorized use our intellectual property could make more expensive business and harm our financial condition and operating results. Our business depends strong brands, and failing maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability expand our base users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed the success our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may the future be, negatively affected number factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product technical performance failures. For example, fail respond appropriately the sharing misinformation objectionable content our services and/or products objectionable practices advertisers, otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence our brands. Furthermore, failure maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely our ability remain technology leader and continue provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play valuable role range settings. face number manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. face number risks related manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability supply both our products and our services. rely contract manufacturers manufacture assemble our devices and servers and networking equipment used our technical infrastructure, and may supply the contract manufacturers with components assemble the devices and equipment. also rely other companies participate the supply components and distribution our products and services. Our business could negatively affected are not able engage these companies with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage fail meet their 13. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms our arrangements with them. have experienced and/or may the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing requirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters pandemics, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes the financial business condition our suppliers. Some the components use our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one limited sources, and may not able find replacement vendors favorable terms the event supply chain disruption. significant supply interruption that affects our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades expansions and delay consumer product availability. may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit significant terms and conditions. may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume sales our devices decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. Our devices have had, and the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, operations. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products and services does not meet expectations our products services are defective require recall, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. require our suppliers and business partners comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such the Google Supplier Code Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. Violations law unethical business practices could result supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm key relationships, and damage our reputation. Their failure procure necessary license rights intellectual property could affect our ability sell our products services and expose litigation financial claims. Interruption to, interference with, failure our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The availability our products and services and fulfillment our customer contracts depend the continuing operation our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable damage, interference, interruption from modifications upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters pandemics, geopolitical tensions armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, utility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial service attacks, phishing schemes, other attempts harm access our systems. Some our data centers are located areas with high risk major earthquakes other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts vandalism, and, some cases, potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced facility operators disruptions result geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening the area. Some our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence natural disaster pandemic, closure facility, other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result lengthy interruptions our service. addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained the past, and may contain the future, errors vulnerabilities, which could result interruptions failure our services systems. Any these incidents could impede prevent from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our international operations expose additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 14. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Our international operations are significant our revenues and net income, and plan continue grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 53% our consolidated revenues 2023. addition risks described elsewhere this section, our international operations expose other risks, including the following: &#8226; restrictions foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the U.S.; &#8226; sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, changes regimes, armed conflict (such ongoing conflicts the Middle East and Ukraine), any which may affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, limit our ability source components final products, prevent impede from operating certain jurisdictions, complying with local laws, offering products services; &#8226; longer payment cycles some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels payment fraud; &#8226; evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject litigation, new regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process clear legal precedent; &#8226; anti-corruption laws, such the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments government officials, violations which could result civil and criminal penalties; and &#8226; different employee/employer relationships, existence works councils and differing labor practices, and other challenges caused distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity doing business multiple jurisdictions. Because conduct business currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results U.S. dollars, have faced, and will continue face, exposure fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates. Although hedge portion our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies have the past and may the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results. are exposed fluctuations the fair values our investments and, some instances, our financial statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. The fair value our debt and equity investments may the future be, and certain investments have been the past, negatively affected liquidity, credit deterioration losses, performance and financial results the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation new benchmark rates, the effect new changing regulations, the stock market general, other factors. measure certain our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled the stock Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired business combination, fair value nonrecurring basis, which inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. All gains and losses non-marketable equity securities are recognized OI&E, which increases the volatility our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses impairments record from fair value remeasurements any particular period may differ significantly from the gains losses ultimately realize such investments. result these factors, the value our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related our Industry People access our products and services through variety platforms and devices that continue evolve with the advancement technology and user preferences. manufacturers and users not widely adopt versions our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could harmed. People access our products and services through growing variety devices such desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices.

Unintended consequences, uses, customization our tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, other social concerns, which may result claims, lawsuits, brand reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Data privacy and security concerns relating our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users customers from using our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs defects, security breaches, and attacks our systems could result the improper disclosure and use user data and interference with our users&#8217; and customers&#8217; ability use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. Concerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard the collection, use, governance, disclosure, security personal data other data-privacy-related matters, even unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. Our products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission proprietary and other sensitive information. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities our products and services, and security breaches expose risk loss improper use and disclosure such information, which could result litigation and other potential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, well reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. continue add new features involving our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely may susceptible unanticipated security threats our and the market&#8217;s understanding AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue develop. have the past discovered, and may the future discover, some errors our software code only after have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure user data could result government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability attract and retain users customers. Such incidents have occurred the past and may continue occur due the scale and nature our products and services.

Cyber attacks continue evolve sophistication and volume, and inherently may difficult detect for long periods time. have seen, and will continue see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our other parties&#8217; systems. expect continue experience such incidents vulnerabilities the future. Our efforts address undesirable activity our platform may also increase the risk retaliatory attack. addition, face the risk cyber attacks nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions armed conflicts, such the ongoing conflict the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. may experience security issues, whether due employee insider error malfeasance, system errors, vulnerabilities our other parties&#8217; systems. While may not determine some these issues material the 16.

For additional information, see also our risk factor privacy and data protection regulations under &#8216;Risks Related Laws, Regulations, and Policies&#8217; below. Our ongoing investments safety, security, and content review will likely continue identify abuse our platforms and misuse user data. addition our efforts prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, are making significant investments safety, security, and review efforts combat misuse our services and unauthorized access user data third parties, including investigation and review platform applications that could access the information users our services. result these efforts, have the past discovered, and may the future discover, incidents unnecessary access misuse user data other undesirable activity third parties. However, may not have discovered, and may the future not discover, all such incidents activity, whether result our data limitations, including our lack visibility over our encrypted services, the scale activity our platform, other factors, including factors outside our control such natural disaster pandemic, and may learn such incidents activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use user data our systems manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts policies, the existence false undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper purchases, activities that threaten people&#8217;s safety on- off-line, instances spamming, scraping, spreading disinformation. While may not determine some these incidents material the time they occurred and may remedy them quickly, there guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There also guarantee that series related issues may not determined material later date the aggregate, even they may not material individually the time their occurrence. may also unsuccessful our efforts enforce our policies otherwise prevent remediate any such incidents. Any the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require change our business practices ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result monetary penalties and damages, divert management&#8217;s time and attention, and lead enhanced regulatory oversight. Problematic content our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations our guidelines could affect the quality our services, which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. We, like others the industry, face violations our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts bad actors manipulate our hosting and advertising systems fraudulently generate revenues, otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest intent. While invest significantly efforts promote high-quality and relevant results and detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, have been unable and may continue unable detect and prevent all such abuses promote 17. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. uniformly high-quality content. Increased use our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues abuse for bad actors. Many websites violate attempt violate our guidelines, including seeking inappropriately rank higher search results than our search engine's assessment their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue affect, the quality content our platforms and lead them display false, misleading, undesirable content. Although English-language web spam our search results has been reduced, and web spam most other languages limited, expect web spammers will continue seek inappropriate ways improve their rankings. Although continue invest and deploy proprietary technology detect and prevent web spam our platforms, there guarantee that our technology will always successful, and our users may have negative experiences our platforms our technology fails work intended, which may affect our users' decisions continuing use our platforms. also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities low-quality content help them improve their search rankings. are continually launching algorithmic changes designed detect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites, but may not always successful. also face other challenges our platforms, including violations our content guidelines involving incidents such attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being our users on- off-line, and the spreading misinformation disinformation. fail either detect and prevent increase problematic content effectively promote high-quality content, could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information reduce use our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. may also subject litigation and regulatory actions, which could result monetary penalties and damages and divert management&#8217;s time and attention. Our business depends continued and unimpeded access the Internet and our users. Internet access providers may able restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services, which could lead additional expenses and the loss users and advertisers. Our products and services depend the ability our users access the Internet, and certain our products require significant bandwidth work effectively. Currently, this access provided companies that have significant market power the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some these providers have taken, have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, increase the cost user access certain our products restricting prohibiting the use their infrastructure support facilitate our offerings, charging increased fees our users provide our offerings, providing our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms discrimination internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit internet access providers restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services. addition, some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject government-initiated restrictions blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business. Risks Related Laws, Regulations, and Policies are subject variety new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely subject even broader scope laws and regulations continue expand our business. are subject numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering wide variety subjects, and our introduction new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue subject additional laws and regulations. recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted large number new laws and regulations relevant the digital economy, particularly the areas data privacy and security, competition, environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs compliance with these measures are high and are likely increase the future. New changing laws and regulations, new interpretations applications existing laws and regulations manner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue result in, less useful products and services, altered business practices, limited ability pursue certain business models offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: &#8226; Competition and technology platforms&#8217; business practices: Laws and regulations focused large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act the European Union (EU); regulations and legal 18. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. settlements the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play&#8217;s billing policies, fees, and business model; well litigation and new regulations under consideration range jurisdictions. &#8226; AI: Laws and regulations focused the development, use, and provision technologies and other digital products and services, which could result monetary penalties other regulatory actions. For example, while legislative text has yet finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement proposed Act was reached between co-legislators December 2023, including that specific transparency and other requirements would introduced for general purpose systems and the models which those systems are based. addition, the White House's Executive Order the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use Artificial Intelligence devises framework for the U.S. government, among other things, regulate private sector use and development certain foundation models. &#8226; Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or sharing user advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the processing children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws). &#8226; Copyright and other intellectual property Copyright and related laws, including the Directive Copyright the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect content uploaded users linked from our platforms, create property rights news publications that could require payments news agencies and publishers, which may result other regulatory actions. &#8226; Content moderation Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida&#8217;s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas&#8217; House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure remove certain types content require disclosure information about the operation our services and algorithms, which may make harder for services like Google Search and YouTube detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, harmful content. &#8226; Consumer protection Consumer protection laws, including the EU&#8217;s New Deal for Consumers, which could result monetary penalties and create range new compliance obligations. addition, the applicability and scope these and other laws and regulations, interpreted courts, regulators, administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could interpreted ways that harm our business. For example, rely statutory safe harbors, like those set forth the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 the Communications Decency Act the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive Europe, protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect and may impose significant operational challenges.

Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, considered the historical trends foreign currency exchange rates and determined that was reasonably possible that adverse changes exchange rates 10% could experienced. use foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign exchange risk assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the functional currency the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses these assets and liabilities are recorded OI&E, which are offset the gains and losses the forward and option contracts. adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated currencies other than the functional currencies the balance sheet date, would have resulted adverse effect income before income taxes approxima tely $136 million and $503 million December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration the effect foreign exchange contracts place for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised combination purchased and written options) protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements. designate these contracts cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. reflect the gains losses foreign currency spot rate changes component accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues offset the hedged exposures they occur. the U.S. dollar weakened 10% December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded AOCI related our cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change the value recorded AOCI would expected offset corresponding foreign currency change forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. use foreign exchange forward contracts designated net investment hedges hedge the foreign currency risks related investment foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations. the U.S. dollar weakened 10%, the amount recorded cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million lower December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject wide variety market-related risks that could substantially reduce increase the fair value our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments privately held companies, some which are the startup development stages. record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method fair value based readily determinable market values, which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject market price volatility, and represent $5.2 billion and $6.0 billion our investments December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. hypothetical adverse price change 10% our December 31, 2023 balance would decrease the fair value marketable equity securities $597 million. From time time, may enter into derivatives hedge the market price risk certain our marketable equity securities. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted fair value for observable transactions for identical similar investments the same issuer impairment (referred the measurement alternative). The fair value measured the time the observable transaction not necessarily indication the current fair value the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies products these companies have under development are typically the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience decline financial condition, which could result loss substantial part our investment these companies. Valuations our equity investments private companies are inherently more complex due the lack readily available market data and observable transactions lower valuations could result significant losses. addition, global economic conditions could result additional volatility. The success our investment any private company also typically dependent the likelihood our ability realize appreciation the value investments through liquidity events such public offerings, acquisitions, private sales other market events. Changes the valuation non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes valuation marketable equity securities. December 31, 2022 and 2023, the carrying value our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. The carrying values our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion December 31, 2022 and 2023, generally not fluctuate based market price changes.
