Because all these investment areas are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and anticipate downward pressure our operating margin the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including changes the devices and modalities used access our products and services; changes geographic mix; deceleration declines advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases our pricing our products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts lower priced products and services. addition, may also experience downward pressure our operating margin resulting from variety factors, such the continued expansion our business into new fields, including products and services such hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, well significant investments Other Bets, all which may have margins lower than those generate from advertising. particular, margins our hardware products have had, and may continue have, adverse affect our consolidated margins due pressures pricing and higher cost sales. may also experience downward pressure our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects our business. Further, certain our costs and expenses are generally less variable nature and may not correlate changes revenue. Additionally, conjunction with our efforts re-engineer costs, may not able execute these efforts timely manner these efforts may not successful. Due these factors and the evolving nature our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not indicative our future performance.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability protect them could reduce the value our products, services, and brands well affect our ability compete. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside our control pose threat our intellectual property rights, well our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which our products and services are distributed made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts have taken protect our proprietary rights may not sufficient effective. Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. There always the possibility that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy such trade secrets and other sensitive information could compromised, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word &#8220;Google&#8221; could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word &#8220;search.&#8221; Some courts have ruled that "Google" protectable trademark, but possible that other courts, particularly those outside the U.S., Table Contents Alphabet Inc. may reach different determination. this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word &#8220;Google&#8221; refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming. Any increase the unauthorized use our intellectual property could make more expensive business and harm our financial condition and operating results. Our business depends strong brands, and failing maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability expand our base users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed the success our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may the future be, negatively affected number factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product technical performance failures. For example, fail respond appropriately the sharing misinformation objectionable content our services and/or products objectionable practices advertisers, otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence our brands. Furthermore, failure maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely our ability remain technology leader and continue provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play valuable role range settings. face number manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. face number risks related manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability supply both our products and our services. rely contract manufacturers manufacture assemble our hardware products and servers and networking equipment used our technical infrastructure, and may supply the contract manufacturers with components assemble the hardware products and equipment. also rely other companies participate the distribution our products and services. Our business could negatively affected are not able engage these companies with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms our arrangements with them. have experienced and/or may the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters pandemics, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes the financial business condition our suppliers. addition, some the components use our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one limited sources, and may not able find replacement vendors favorable terms the event supply chain disruption. significant supply interruption that affects our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades expansions and delay consumer product availability. may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit significant terms and conditions. may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. Our products and services have had, and the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, operations. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other Table Contents Alphabet Inc. manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products and services does not meet expectations our products services are defective, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. require our suppliers and business partners comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such the Google Supplier Code Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. Violations law unethical business practices could result supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm key relationships, and damage our reputation. Their failure procure necessary license rights intellectual property could affect our ability sell our products services and expose litigation financial claims. Interruption to, interference with, failure our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The availability our products and services and fulfillment our customer contracts depend the continuing operation our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable damage, interference, interruption from modifications upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters pandemics, geopolitical tensions armed conflicts, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer denial service attacks, phishing schemes, other attempts harm access our systems. Some our data centers are located areas with high risk major earthquakes other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts vandalism, and, some cases, potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced facility operators disruptions result geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening the area. Some our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence natural disaster pandemic, closure facility, other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result lengthy interruptions our service. addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained the past, and may contain the future, errors vulnerabilities, which could result interruptions failure our services systems. Any these incidents could impede prevent from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our international operations expose additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our international operations are significant our revenues and net income, and plan continue grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 51% our consolidated revenues 2022. addition risks described elsewhere this section, our international operations expose other risks, including the following: &#8226; restrictions foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the U.S.; &#8226; import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent impede from offering products providing services particular market, that could limit our ability source assemblies and finished products from particular market, and may increase our operating costs; &#8226; longer payment cycles some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels payment fraud; &#8226; evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject new regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), addition other adverse effects that are unable effectively anticipate; &#8226; sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability operate certain jurisdictions comply with local laws, including result geopolitical tensions armed conflicts, such the ongoing conflict Ukraine; &#8226; political unrest, conflict, and changes governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage our products and services, may limit the ability for people certain areas access and use our products and services, may impede from offering products providing services particular market; &#8226; anti-corruption laws, such the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments government officials, violations which could result civil and criminal penalties; Table Contents Alphabet Inc. &#8226; uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty result local laws, insufficient due process, and lack legal precedent; and &#8226; different employee/employer relationships, existence works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused distance, language, and cultural differences, making harder business certain jurisdictions. Because conduct business currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results U.S. dollars, have faced, and will continue face, exposure fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates. Although hedge portion our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results. are exposed fluctuations the fair values our investments and, some instances, our financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective nature resulting fluctuations over time. The fair value our investments may the future be, and certain investments have been the past, negatively affected liquidity, credit deterioration losses, performance and financial results the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation new benchmark rates, the effect new changing regulations, the stock market general, other factors. measure certain our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled the stock certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired business combination, fair value nonrecurring basis. The determination fair value involves use appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. adjust the carrying value our non-marketable equity securities fair value for observable transactions identical similar investments the same issuer for impairments. All gains and losses non-marketable equity securities, are recognized other income (expense), which increases the volatility our other income (expense). The unrealized gains and losses record from fair value remeasurements our non-marketable equity securities any particular period may differ significantly from the gains losses ultimately realize such investments. result these factors, the value our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related our Industry People access the Internet through variety platforms and devices that continue evolve with the advancement technology and user preferences. manufacturers and users not widely adopt versions our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could harmed. People access the Internet through growing variety devices such desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may less popular some interfaces. Each manufacturer distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not available may only available with limited functionality for our users our advertisers these devices result. Some manufacturers may also elect not include our products their devices. addition, search queries may undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media other platforms, which could harm our business. hard predict the challenges may encounter adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. expect continue devote significant resources creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing attract and retain substantial number new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, failing develop products and technologies that work well new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability capture future business opportunities. Data privacy and security concerns relating our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users customers from using our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs defects, security breaches, and attacks our systems could result the improper disclosure and use user data and interference with our users&#8217; and customers&#8217; ability use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. Concerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard the collection, use, governance, disclosure, security personal data other data-privacy-related matters, even unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Our products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission proprietary and other sensitive information. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities our products and services, and security breaches expose risk loss improper use and disclosure such information, which could result litigation and other potential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, well reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. have the past discovered, and may the future discover, some errors our software code only after have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure user data could result government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability attract and retain users customers. Such incidents have occurred the past and may continue occur due the scale and nature our products and services. While there guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, expect continue expend significant resources maintain security protections that limit the effect bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities breaches. experience cyber attacks and other attempts gain unauthorized access our systems regular basis. Cyber attacks continue evolve sophistication and volume, and inherently may difficult detect for long periods time. have seen, and will continue see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such the Log4j vulnerability reported December 2021, which could affect our other parties&#8217; systems. expect continue experience such incidents vulnerabilities the future. Our efforts address undesirable activity our platform may also increase the risk retaliatory attack. addition, face the risk cyber attacks nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions armed conflicts, such the ongoing conflict Ukraine, may increase these risks. may experience security issues, whether due employee insider error malfeasance, system errors, vulnerabilities our other parties&#8217; systems. While may not determine some these issues material the time they occur and may remedy them quickly, there guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There also guarantee that series issues may not determined material later date the aggregate, even they may not material individually the time their occurrence. Because the techniques used obtain unauthorized access to, disable degrade service provided otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required law, have been unable the past and may continue unable anticipate detect attacks vulnerabilities implement adequate preventative measures. Further, any partners with whom share user other customer information fail implement adequate data-security practices, fail comply with our terms and policies, otherwise suffer network other security breach, our users&#8217; data may improperly accessed, used, disclosed. actual perceived breach our our business partners&#8217; service providers&#8217; security occurs, the market perception the effectiveness our security measures would harmed, could lose users and customers, our trade secrets those our business partners may compromised, and may exposed significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. While have dedicated significant resources privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times natural disaster pandemic, may not adequate, may fail accurately assess the severity incident, may not fast enough prevent limit harm, may fail sufficiently remediate incident. result, may suffer significant legal, reputational, financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. For additional information, see also our risk factor privacy and data protection regulations under &#8216;Risks Related Laws, Regulations, and Policies&#8217; below. Our ongoing investments safety, security, and content review will likely continue identify abuse our platforms and misuse user data. addition our efforts prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, are making significant investments safety, security, and review efforts combat misuse our services and unauthorized access user data third parties, including investigation and review platform applications that could access the information users our services. result these efforts, have the past discovered, and may the future discover, incidents unnecessary access misuse user data other undesirable activity third parties. However, may not have discovered, and may the future not discover, all such incidents activity, whether result our data limitations, including Table Contents Alphabet Inc. our lack visibility over our encrypted services, the scale activity our platform, other factors, including factors outside our control such natural disaster pandemic, and may learn such incidents activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use user data our systems manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts policies, the existence false undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper purchases, activities that threaten people&#8217;s safety on- off-line, instances spamming, scraping, spreading disinformation. While may not determine some these incidents material the time they occurred and may remedy them quickly, there guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There also guarantee that series issues may not determined material later date the aggregate, even they may not material individually the time their occurrence. may also unsuccessful our efforts enforce our policies otherwise prevent remediate any such incidents. Any the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require change our business practices ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result monetary penalties and damages, divert management&#8217;s time and attention, and lead enhanced regulatory oversight. Problematic content our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations our guidelines could affect the quality our services, which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. We, like others the industry, face violations our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts bad actors manipulate our hosting and advertising systems fraudulently generate revenues, otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest intent. While invest significantly efforts promote high-quality and relevant results and detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, have been unable and may continue unable detect and prevent all such abuses promote uniformly high-quality content. Many websites violate attempt violate our guidelines, including seeking inappropriately rank higher search results than our search engine's assessment their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue affect, the quality content our platforms and lead them display false, misleading, undesirable content. Although English-language web spam our search results has been reduced, and web spam most other languages limited, expect web spammers will continue seek inappropriate ways improve their rankings. continuously combat web spam our search results, including through indexing technology that makes harder for spam-like, less useful web content rank highly. also continue invest and deploy proprietary technology detect and prevent web spam our platforms. also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities low-quality content help them improve their search rankings. are continually launching algorithmic changes designed detect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites. also face other challenges our platforms, including violations our content guidelines involving incidents such attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being our users on- off-line, and the spreading misinformation disinformation. fail either detect and prevent increase problematic content effectively promote high-quality content, could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information reduce use our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. may also subject litigation and regulatory actions, which could result monetary penalties and damages and divert management&#8217;s time and attention. Our business depends continued and unimpeded access the Internet and our users. Internet access providers may able restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services, which could lead additional expenses and the loss users and advertisers. Our products and services depend the ability our users access the Internet, and certain our products require significant bandwidth work effectively. Currently, this access provided companies that have significant market power the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some these providers have taken, have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, increase the cost user access certain our products restricting prohibiting the use their infrastructure support facilitate our offerings, charging increased fees our users provide our offerings, providing our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms discrimination internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit Table Contents Alphabet Inc. internet access providers restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services. addition, some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject government-initiated restrictions blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business. Risks Related Laws, Regulations, and Policies are subject variety new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely subject even broader scope laws and regulations continue expand our business. are subject numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering wide variety subjects, and our introduction new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue subject additional laws and regulations. recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted large number new laws and regulations relevant the digital economy, particularly the areas data privacy and security, competition, and online content. The costs compliance with these measures are high and are likely increase the future. New changing laws and regulations, new interpretations applications existing laws and regulations manner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue result in, less useful products and services, altered business practices, limited ability pursue certain business models offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: &#8226; Competition and technology platforms&#8217; business practices: Laws and regulations focused large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act the European Union (EU); regulations South Korea and elsewhere that affect Google Play&#8217;s billing policies, fees, and business model; well regulations under consideration range jurisdictions. &#8226; Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or sharing user advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the processing children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws). &#8226; Copyright and other intellectual property Copyright and related laws, including the Directive Copyright the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect content uploaded users linked from our platforms, create property rights news publications that could require payments news agencies and publishers. &#8226; Content moderation Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida&#8217;s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas&#8217; House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure remove certain types content require disclosure information about the operation our services and algorithms, which may make harder for services like Google Search and YouTube detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, harmful content. &#8226; Consumer protection Consumer protection laws, including the EU&#8217;s New Deal for Consumers, which could result monetary penalties and create range new compliance obligations. addition, the applicability and scope these and other laws and regulations, interpreted the courts, remain uncertain and could interpreted ways that harm our business. For example, rely statutory safe harbors, like those set forth the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 the Communications Decency Act the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive Europe, protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation the U.S. (such Gonzalez Google EU, and around the world that could diminish eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms. are and may continue subject claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. are subject claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated our users, goods and services offered advertisers publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. also are subject variety claims including Table Contents Alphabet Inc. product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related product defects, among other litigation, and may also subject claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, service disruptions failures. Claims have been brought, and expect will continue brought, against for defamation, negligence, breaches contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, other legal theories based the nature and content information available via our services due our involvement hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, providing access content created third parties. For example, the U.S. Department Justice, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution Google Search, and the operation and distribution the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation where appropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have the past, and may the future result substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes our products and services, alterations our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation other adverse consequences, all which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Any these legal proceedings could result legal costs, diversion management resources, negative publicity and other harms our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution one more such proceedings has resulted in, and may the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Privacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure alleged failure comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering number legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, data usage, and encryption user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, regulation have resulted in, and may continue result in, fines and orders requiring that change our practices, which have had and could continue have adverse effect how provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause incur substantial costs harm the quality and operations our products and services ways that harm our business. Examples these laws include: &#8226; The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which apply all our activities conducted from establishment the the United Kingdom, respectively, related products and services that offer the United Kingdom users customers, respectively, the monitoring their behavior the the UK, respectively. &#8226; Various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all which give new data privacy rights their respective residents (including, California, private right action the event data breach resulting from our failure implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations controllers and processors consumer data. &#8226; State laws governing the processing biometric information, such the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act and the Texas Capture Use Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations businesses that collect disclose consumer biometric information. &#8226; Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences children and minors, including the collection and processing children and minor&#8217;s data. These include the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the California Age Appropriate Design Code, all which address the use and disclosure the personal data children and minors and impose obligations online services products directed likely accessed children. &#8226; The California Internet Things Security Law, which regulates the security data used connection with internet-connected devices. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. &#8226; The EU&#8217;s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines share anonymized data with rival companies, among other changes. Further, are subject evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances can transfer, process and/or receive personal data. Previously available transfer mechanisms, such the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, were invalidated 2020, and other bases for data transfer and storage, such Standard Contractual Clauses, remain subject ongoing review ways that may require adapt our existing contractual arrangements. The validity various data transfer mechanisms remains subject legal, regulatory, and political developments both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework adopted the EU, the legal uncertainty and ongoing enforcement action from supervisory authorities related cross-border transfers personal data, could harm our ability process and transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area and could turn harm our ability provide, and our customers&#8217; ability use, some our products and services. face, and may continue face, intellectual property and other claims that could costly defend, result significant damage awards other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability use certain technologies. We, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject litigation based allegations infringement other violations intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against filing claims U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek generate income from patents they have obtained bringing claims against us. continue expand our business, the number intellectual property claims against has increased and may continue increase develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. Adverse results any these lawsuits may include awards monetary damages, costly royalty licensing agreements (if licenses are available all), orders limiting our ability sell our products and services the U.S. elsewhere, including preventing from offering certain features, functionalities, products, services certain jurisdictions. They may also cause change our business practices ways that could result loss revenues for and otherwise harm our business. Many our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result increased costs for defending such claims significant damages there were adverse ruling any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use our products, services, and technologies, result injunctions otherwise, which could result loss revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, connection with our divestitures, have agreed, and may the future agree, provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive litigate settle. the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating results. Expectations relating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose potential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm. are subject laws, regulations, and other measures that govern wide range topics, including those related matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements. have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced number goals and initiatives. The implementation these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all their contingencies, dependencies, and certain cases, reliance third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and cannot guarantee that will achieve them. Any failure, perceived failure, adhere our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations ESG laws and regulations, meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. could subject changes tax rates, the adoption new U.S. international tax legislation, exposure additional tax liabilities.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK are exposed financial market risks, including changes foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk transact business globally multiple currencies. International revenues, well costs and expenses denominated foreign currencies, expose the risk fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, considered the historical trends foreign currency exchange rates and determined that was reasonably possible that adverse changes exchange rates 10% could experienced. use foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign exchange risk assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the functional currency the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses these assets and liabilities are recorded other income (expense), net, which are offset the gains and losses the forward and option contracts. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated currencies other than the functional currencies the balance sheet date, would have resulted adverse effect income before income taxes approxima tely $285 million and $136 million December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration the effect foreign exchange contracts place for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised combination purchased and written options) protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements. designate these contracts cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. reflect the gains losses foreign currency spot rate changes component accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues offset the hedged exposures they occur. the U.S. dollar weakened 10% December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded AOCI related our cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021 and 2022. The change the value recorded AOCI would expected offset corresponding foreign currency change forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. use foreign exchange forward contracts designated net investment hedges hedge the foreign currency risks related investment foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations. the U.S. dollar weakened 10%, the amount recorded cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million lower December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change value recorded CTA would expected offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain loss from our investment foreign subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy achieve return that ill allow preserve capital and maintain liquidity. invest primarily debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. policy, limit the amount credit exposure any one issuer. Our investments both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry degree interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due rise interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted interest rates fall. Unrealized gains losses our marketable debt securities are primarily due interest rate fluctuations compared interest rates the time purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, have elected the fair value option for which changes fair value are recorded other income (expense), net. measure securities for which have not elected the fair value option fair value with gains and losses recorded AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis determine the potential effect fluctuations interest rates the value our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR the expected loss fair value, for given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due adverse movements interest rates. use variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss fair value marketable debt securities December 31, 2021 and 2022 are shown below (in millions): December 31, 12-Month Average December 31, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Risk category interest rate 139 256 148 198 Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed December 31, 2021 and 2022 due the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount changes interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis not intended represent actual losses but used risk estimation. Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject wide variety market-related risks that could substantially reduce increase the fair value our holdings. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments privately held companies, some which are the startup development stages. record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method fair value based readily determinable market values, which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject market price volatility, and represent $7.8 billion and $5.2 billion our investments December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. hypothetical adverse price change 10% our December 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value marketable equity securities $516 million. From time time, may enter into derivatives hedge the market price risk certain our marketable equity securities. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted fair value for observable transactions for identical similar investments the same issuer impairment (referred the measurement alternative). The fair value measured the time the observable transaction not necessarily indication the current fair value the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies products these companies have under development are typically the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience decline financial condition, which could result loss substantial part our investment these companies. Valuations our equity investments private companies are inherently more complex due the lack readily available market data and observable transactions lower valuations could result significant losses. addition, global economic conditions could result additional volatility. The success our investment any private company also typically dependent the likelihood our ability realize appreciation the value investments through liquidity events such public offerings, acquisitions, private sales other market events. Changes the valuation non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes valuation marketable equity securities. December 31, 2021 and 2022, the carrying value our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion, respectively.
