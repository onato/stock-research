These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not able compete effectively operate sufficient levels profitability. addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all these new ventures are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and anticipate downward pressure our operating margin the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including increasing competition. Changes device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix and increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. may also experience decline our revenue growth rate our revenues increase higher levels, there decrease the rate adoption our products, services, and technologies, due deceleration decline demand for devices used access our services, among other factors. addition, may also experience downward pressure our operating margin resulting from variety factors, such the continued expansion our business into new fields, including products and services such hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, well significant investments Other Bets, all which may have margins lower than those generate from advertising. may also experience downward pressure our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects our business. Due these factors and the evolving nature our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not indicative our future performance. For additional information, see Trends Our Business and Financial Effect Part II, Item this Annual Report Form 10-K. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability protect them could reduce the value our products, services, and brands well affect our ability compete. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside our control pose threat our intellectual property rights, well our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which our products and services are distributed made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts have taken protect our proprietary rights may not sufficient effective. Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. There always the possibility that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy such trade secrets and other sensitive information could compromised, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word &#8220;Google&#8221; could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word &#8220;search.&#8221; Some courts have ruled that "Google" protectable trademark, but possible that other courts, particularly those outside the U.S., may reach different determination. this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word &#8220;Google&#8221; refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming. Any increase the unauthorized use our intellectual property could make more expensive business and harm our operating results. Our business depends strong brands, and failing maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability expand our base users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed the success our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may the future be, negatively affected number factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product technical performance failures. For example, fail respond appropriately the sharing misinformation objectionable content our services and/or products objectionable practices advertisers, otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence our brands. Furthermore, failure maintain and enhance equity our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely our ability remain technology leader and continue provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play valuable role range settings. face number manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our financial condition, operating results, and prospects. face number risks related manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability supply both our products and our internet-based services. rely other companies manufacture many our finished products; design certain our components and parts; participate the distribution our products and services; and design, manufacture, assemble certain components and parts our technical infrastructure. Our business could negatively affected are not able engage these companies with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms our arrangements with them. have experienced and/or may the future experience supply shortages and/or price increases that could negatively affect our operations, driven raw material, component part availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters pandemics, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), and significant changes the financial business condition our suppliers. addition, some the components use our technical infrastructure and products are available from only one limited sources, and may not able find replacement vendors favorable terms the event supply chain disruption. addition, significant supply interruption that affects our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades expansions and delay product availability. may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit significant terms and conditions. may liable for materials and products that are not consumed due market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Our products and services have had, and the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, operations. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products and services does not meet expectations our products services are defective, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. require our suppliers and business partners comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such the Google Supplier Code Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. Violations law unethical business practices could result supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm key relationships, and damage our reputation. Their failure procure necessary license rights intellectual property could affect our ability sell our products services and expose litigation financial claims. Interruption to, interference with, failure our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. addition, problems with the design implementation our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations. The availability our products and services and fulfillment our customer contracts depend the continuing operation our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable damage, interference, interruption from modifications upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters pandemics, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial service attacks, phishing schemes, other attempts harm access our systems. Some our data centers are located areas with high risk major earthquakes other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts vandalism, and, some cases, potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced facility operators. Some our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence natural disaster pandemic, closure facility, other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result lengthy interruptions our service. addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained the past, and may contain the future, errors vulnerabilities, which could result interruptions failure our services systems. addition, rely extensively information systems and technology manage our business and summarize operating results. are the process multi-year implementation new ERP system, which designed accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow financial information, improve data management, and provide timely information our management team. the phased implementation continues, may experience delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure successfully design and implement the ERP system planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, not effectively implement the ERP system planned the ERP system does not operate intended, the effectiveness our internal control over financial reporting could negatively affected. Our international operations expose additional risks that could harm our business, our financial condition, and operating results. Our international operations are significant our revenues and net income, and plan continue grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% our consolidated revenues 2021. addition risks described elsewhere this section, our international operations expose other risks, including the following: &#8226; restrictions foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the U.S.; &#8226; import and export requirements, tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent impede from offering products providing services particular market, that could limit our ability source assemblies and finished products from particular market, and may increase our operating costs; &#8226; longer payment cycles some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels payment fraud; &#8226; evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject new regulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer personal data between the and the United Kingdom and new customer requirements), addition other adverse effects that are unable effectively anticipate; Table Contents Alphabet Inc. &#8226; anti-corruption laws, such the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments government officials, violations which could result civil and criminal penalties; &#8226; uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty result local laws and lack legal precedent; and &#8226; different employee/employer relationships, existence works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused distance, language, and cultural differences, making harder business certain jurisdictions. Because conduct business currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results U.S. dollars, have faced, and will continue face, exposure fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates. Although hedge portion our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related our Industry People access the Internet through variety platforms and devices that continue evolve with the advancement technology and user preferences. manufacturers and users not widely adopt versions our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could harmed. People access the Internet through growing variety devices such desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may less popular some interfaces. Each manufacturer distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not available may only available with limited functionality for our users our advertisers these devices result. Some manufacturers may also elect not include our products their devices. addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media other platforms, which could harm our business. hard predict the challenges may encounter adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. expect continue devote significant resources creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing attract and retain substantial number new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, failing develop products and technologies that work well new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability capture future business opportunities. Data privacy and security concerns relating our technology and our practices could damage our reputation, cause incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users customers from using our products and services. Software bugs defects, security breaches, and attacks our systems could result the improper disclosure and use user data and interference with our users&#8217; and customers&#8217; ability use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation.

Additionally, our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, vulnerabilities. have the past discovered, and may the future discover, some errors our software code only after have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure user data could result government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability attract and retain users customers. Such incidents have occurred the past and may continue occur due the scale and nature our products and services. While there guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, expect continue expend significant resources maintain security protections that limit the effect bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities breaches. experience cyber attacks and other attempts gain unauthorized access our systems regular basis. Cyber attacks continue evolve sophistication and volume, and inherently may difficult detect for long periods time. have seen, and will continue see, industry-wide vulnerabilities, such the Log4j vulnerability reported December 2021, which could affect our other parties&#8217; systems. expect continue experience such Table Contents Alphabet Inc. incidents vulnerabilities the future. Our efforts address undesirable activity our platform may also increase the risk retaliatory attack. may experience future security issues, whether due employee error malfeasance system errors vulnerabilities our other parties&#8217; systems. While may not determine some these issues material the time they occur and may remedy them quickly, there guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. Because the techniques used obtain unauthorized access to, disable degrade service provided otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required law, have been unable the past and may continue unable anticipate detect attacks vulnerabilities implement adequate preventative measures. Further, any partners with whom share user other customer information fail implement adequate data-security practices fail comply with our terms and policies otherwise suffer network other security breach, our users&#8217; information may improperly accessed, used, disclosed. actual perceived breach our our business partners&#8217; service providers&#8217; security occurs, the market perception the effectiveness our security measures would harmed, could lose users and customers, our trade secrets those our business partners may compromised, and may exposed significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory action, fines, and penalties. Any the foregoing consequences could have material and adverse effect our business, reputation, and results operations.

Any such developments may also subject additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result monetary penalties and damages, divert management&#8217;s time and attention, and lead enhanced regulatory oversight. Problematic content our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations our guidelines could affect the quality our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. We, like others the industry, face violations our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts bad actors manipulate our hosting and advertising systems fraudulently generate revenues, otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest intent. While invest significantly efforts promote high-quality and relevant results and detect and prevent low-quality content and Table Contents Alphabet Inc. invalid traffic, have been unable and may continue unable adequately detect and prevent all such abuses promote uniformly high-quality content. Many websites violate attempt violate our guidelines, including seeking inappropriately rank higher search results than our search engine's assessment their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue affect, the quality content our platforms and lead them display false, misleading, undesirable content. Although English-language web spam our search results has been reduced, and web spam most other languages limited, expect web spammers will continue seek inappropriate ways improve their rankings. continuously combat web spam our search results, including through indexing technology that makes harder for spam-like, less useful web content rank highly. also continue invest and deploy proprietary technology detect and prevent web spam our platforms. also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities low-quality content help them improve their search rankings. are continually launching algorithmic changes designed detect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites. also face other challenges our platforms, including violations our content guidelines involving incidents such attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being our users on- off-line, and the spreading misinformation disinformation. fail either detect and prevent increase problematic content effectively promote high-quality content, could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information reduce use our platforms, harming our financial condition operating results. may also subject litigation and regulatory action, which could result monetary penalties and damages and divert management&#8217;s time and attention. Our business depends continued and unimpeded access the Internet and our users. Internet access providers may able restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services, which could lead additional expenses and the loss users and advertisers. Our products and services depend the ability our users access the Internet, and certain our products require significant bandwidth work effectively. Currently, this access provided companies that have significant market power the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some these providers have taken, have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, increase the cost user access certain our products restricting prohibiting the use their infrastructure support facilitate our offerings, charging increased fees our users provide our offerings, providing our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms discrimination internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit internet access providers restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services. addition, some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject government-initiated restrictions blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability attract new ones; damage our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business. Risks Related Laws, Regulations, and Policies face increased regulatory scrutiny well changes regulatory conditions, laws, and policies governing wide range topics that may negatively affect our business. and other companies the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny, enforcement action, and other proceedings. For instance, the U.S. Department Justice, joined number state Attorneys General, filed antitrust complaint against Google October 20, 2020, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating Search and Search advertising. Similarly, December 16, 2020, number state Attorneys General filed antitrust complaint against Google the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws well state deceptive trade laws relating its advertising technology. Various other regulatory agencies the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, data protection authorities, grand juries, inter-agency consultative groups, and range other governmental bodies have and continue review and some cases challenge our products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations around the world. continue cooperate with these investigations and defend litigation where appropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have the past, and may the future, result substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes our products and services, alterations our business models and operations, and collateral litigation, all which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Changes international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions laws and policies have the past, and may the future, increase our cost doing business and limit our ability pursue certain business models, offer products services certain jurisdictions, cause change our business practices. have the past had alter stop offering certain products and services result laws regulations that made them unfeasible, and new laws regulations could result our having terminate, alter, withdraw products and services the future. Additional costs doing business, new limitations, changes our business model practices could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. are subject regulations, laws, and policies that govern wide range topics, including those related matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new regulations, laws, policies, and international accords relating environmental and social matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements. have implemented robust environmental and social programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced number goals and initiatives, including those related environmental sustainability and diversity. The implementation these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all their contingencies, dependencies, and certain cases, reliance third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and cannot guarantee that will achieve them. Additionally, there can assurance that our current programs, reporting frameworks, and principles will compliance with any new environmental and social laws and regulations that may promulgated the U.S. and elsewhere, and the costs changing any our current practices comply with any new legal and regulatory requirements the U.S. and elsewhere may substantial. Furthermore, industry and market practices may further develop become even more robust than what required under any new laws and regulations, and may have expend significant efforts and resources keep with market trends and stay competitive among our peers. variety new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business. are subject numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering wide variety subject matters. New laws and regulations, new interpretations applications existing laws and regulations manner inconsistent with our practices, have made, and may continue make, our products and services less useful, limit our ability pursue certain business models offer certain products and services certain jurisdictions, require incur substantial costs, expose civil criminal liability, cause change our business practices. These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central our business, including, among others: &#8226; Laws and regulations around the world focused large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act the European Union and proposed antitrust legislation self-preferencing and mergers and acquisitions the U.S., which may limit certain business practices, and some cases, create the risk significant penalties. &#8226; Privacy laws, such the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, Virginia CDPA, and ColoPA (as defined and discussed further below). &#8226; Data protection laws passed many states within the U.S. and certain countries regarding notification data subjects and/or regulators when there security breach personal data. &#8226; Consumer protection laws, including EU&#8217;s New Deal for Consumers, which could result monetary penalties and create range new compliance obligations. &#8226; New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing advertising-related data. Copyright similar laws around the world, including the Directive Copyright the Digital Single Market (EUCD) and member state transpositions. These and similar laws that have been adopted proposed introduce new licensing regimes that could affect our ability operate. The EUCD and similar laws could also increase the liability some content-sharing services with respect content uploaded their users. Some these laws, well follow-on administrative judicial actions, have also created may create new property right news publications that limits the ability some online services link to, interact with, present such content. They may also require individual collective compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers for the use such content, which may result payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such content provides Google and its users, potentially harming our services, commercial operations, and business results. &#8226; Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types data collected particular country stored and/or processed within that country. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. &#8226; Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution certain materials children and regulate the ability online services collect information from minors, including the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act 1998 and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Age-Appropriate Design Code. &#8226; Various laws with regard content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such the Network Enforcement Act Germany and the European Union's pending Digital Services Act, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject significant fines such laws are interpreted and applied manner inconsistent with our practices when may not proactively discover such content due the scale third-party content and the limitations existing technologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure remove certain types content. &#8226; Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model, which could result monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition. &#8226; Various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure information about the operation our services and algorithms, which may make easier for websites artificially promote low-quality, deceptive, harmful content services like Google Search and YouTube, potentially harming the quality our services. addition, the applicability and scope these laws, interpreted the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business. For example: &#8226; rely statutory safe harbors, set forth the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 the Communications Decency Act the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals both the U.S. and that could reduce our safe harbor protection. &#8226; Court decisions such the judgment the Court Justice the European Union (CJEU) May 13, 2014 the &#8216;right forgotten,&#8217; which allows individuals demand that Google remove search results about them certain instances, may limit the content can show our users and impose significant operational burdens. The introduction new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities certain jurisdictions, other actions take have subjected us, and will likely continue subject us, additional laws and regulations. Our investment variety new fields, such healthcare and payment services, has expanded, and will continue expand, the scope regulations that apply our business. The costs compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely increase the future. Any failure our part comply with laws and regulations can result negative publicity and diversion management time and effort and may subject significant liabilities and other penalties. are subject claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. are subject claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated our users, goods and services offered advertisers publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due our manufacturing and sale expanded suite products and services, including hardware well Google Cloud offerings, also are subject variety claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related product defects, among other litigation. may also subject claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, service disruptions failures. Any these types legal proceedings can have adverse effect because legal costs, diversion management resources, negative publicity and other factors.

Defense such actions could costly and involve significant time and attention our management and other resources, may result monetary liabilities penalties, and may require change our business adverse manner. Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure alleged failure comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering number legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and limits encryption user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, regulation have resulted in, and may continue result in, fines and orders requiring that change our data practices, which could have adverse effect our ability provide services, harming our business operations. Complying with these evolving laws could result substantial costs and harm the quality our products and services, negatively affecting our business, and may particularly challenging during certain times, such natural disaster pandemic. Amongst others, are and will subject the following laws and regulations: &#8226; The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies all our activities conducted from establishment the related products and services that offer users customers, the monitoring their behavior the EU. Ensuring compliance with the range obligations created the GDPR ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs. Despite our efforts, governmental authorities others have asserted and may continue assert that our business practices fail comply with its requirements. our operations are found violate the GDPR requirements, may incur substantial fines, have change our business practices, and face reputational harm, any which could have adverse effect our business. Serious breaches the GDPR can result administrative fines annual worldwide revenues. Fines annual worldwide revenues can levied for other specified violations. &#8226; Various state privacy laws, such the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (CCPA), which came into effect January 2020; the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will into effect 2023; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (Virginia CDPA), which will into effect 2023; and the Colorado Privacy Act (ColoPA), which will into effect 2023; all which give new data privacy rights their respective residents (including, California, private right action the event data breach resulting from our failure implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations controllers and processors consumer data. &#8226; SB-327 California, which regulates the security data connection with internet connected devices. Further, are subject evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances can transfer, process and/or receive personal data. The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks that previously allowed U.S. companies that self-certify the U.S. Department Commerce and publicly commit comply with specified requirements import personal data from the and Switzerland have been invalidated the CJEU. The CJEU upheld Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) valid transfer mechanism, provided they meet certain requirements.
