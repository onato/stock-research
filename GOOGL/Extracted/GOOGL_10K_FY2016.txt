Risks Related Our Businesses and Industries face intense competition. not continue innovate and provide products and services that are useful users, may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could adversely affected. Our businesses are rapidly evolving, intensely competitive, and subject changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions new products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily our ability accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative products and technologies the marketplace rapidly and, for Google, provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users. our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure innovate will encompass wider range products and services, including products and services that may outside our historical core business. result, must continue invest significant resources research and development, including through acquisitions, order enhance our search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. have many competitors different industries, including general purpose search engines and information services; vertical search engines and e-commerce websites; social networks; other forms advertising and online advertising platforms and networks; companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer electronic products; providers enterprise cloud services and digital video services; and digital assistant providers. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies emerging start-ups. Some large companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experiences and resources ways that could affect our competitive position, including making acquisitions, continuing invest heavily research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether not meritorious), and continuing compete aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may able innovate and provide products and services faster than can may foresee the consumer need for products and services before us. addition, new products and services can sometimes present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, which may negatively impact our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our revenues and operating results. Our operating results would also suffer our innovations are not responsive the needs our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members; are not appropriately timed with market opportunities; are not effectively brought market. technology continues develop, our competitors may able offer user experiences that are, that are seen be, substantially similar better than ours.

Those partners may not continue business with not create more value (such increased numbers users customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. not provide superior value deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively, could see decrease revenue and other adverse impacts our business. addition, expenditures advertisers tend cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have material negative impact user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers reduce the amounts they spend advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business. Our ongoing investment new businesses and new products, services, and technologies inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations. &#32; have invested and expect continue invest new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The creation Alphabet new holding company 2015 and the investments that are making across various areas Google and Other Bets are reflection our ongoing efforts innovate and provide products and services that Table Contents Alphabet Inc. are useful users. &#32; Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return capital our investments, distraction management from current operations, use alternative investment compensation structures, and unidentified issues not discovered our due diligence such strategies and offerings that could cause fail realize the anticipated benefits such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. More people are using devices other than desktop computers access the Internet and accessing new devices make search queries. manufacturers and users not widely adopt versions our search technology, products, operating systems developed for these devices, our business could adversely affected. &#32; The number people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such laptops and tablets, video game consoles, digital assistants, and television set-top devices, increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use our products and services through such devices more difficult (or just different) and the versions our products and services developed for these devices may not compelling users, manufacturers, distributors alternative devices. Each manufacturer distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work viewable these devices result. Some manufacturers may also elect not include our products their devices. addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via &#8220;apps&#8221; tailored particular devices social media platforms, which could affect our search and advertising business over time. new devices and platforms are continually being released, difficult predict the problems may encounter adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. expect continue devote significant resources the creation, support, and maintenance products and services across multiple platforms and devices. are unable attract and retain substantial number alternative device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users our products and services, are slow develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, will fail capture the opportunities available consumers and advertisers continue exist dynamic, multi-screen environment. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and anticipate downward pressure our operating margin the future. &#32; Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including: &#8226; increasing competition, &#8226; changes property mix, platform mix, device mix, and geographical mix, &#8226; the challenges maintaining our growth rate our revenues increase higher levels, &#8226; the evolution the online advertising market, including the increasing variety online platforms for advertising, and the other markets which participate, and &#8226; the rate user adoption our products, services, and technologies. believe our margins could experience downward pressure result increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects our business well the continuing shift mobile, changes device mix, and the contribution new businesses overall revenue. For instance, the margin revenues generate from our Google Network Members significantly less than the margin revenues generate from advertising Google properties. Consequently, our margins will experience downward pressure greater percentage our revenues comes from ads placed our Google Network Members' properties compared revenues generated through ads placed Google properties. Additionally, the margin earn revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease the future pay even larger percentage advertising fees our Google Network Members. Furthermore, our multi-device world, generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. also expect our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) paid our distribution partners increase due changes device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage queries channeled through paid access points. Additionally, our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin the sale digital content, hardware products, and cloud-based services have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search Further, our margins could impacted adversely spend proportionately larger amount promote new products and services distribute certain products invest more heavily our innovation efforts across the Company (such our Other Bets businesses) than have historically. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. are subject increasing regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business. Additionally, changes policies governing wide range topics may adversely affect our business. &#32; The growth our company and our expansion into variety new fields involves variety new regulatory issues, and have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny have grown. For instance, various regulatory agencies are reviewing aspects our search and other businesses. continue cooperate with the European Commission and other regulatory authorities around the world investigations they are conducting with respect our business. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, interpret and apply existing laws policies, ways that make our products and services less useful our users, require incur substantial costs, expose unanticipated civil criminal liability, cause change our business practices. Additionally, changes social, political, and regulatory conditions laws and policies governing wide range topics may disrupt our business practices. These changes could negatively impact our business and results operations material ways. variety new and existing laws could subject claims otherwise harm our business. &#32; are subject numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering wide variety subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. For example, current and new patent laws such U.S. patent laws and European patent laws may affect the ability companies, including us, protect their innovations and defend against claims patent infringement. Similarly, changes copyright laws being considered Europe and elsewhere may increase costs require companies, including us, change cease offering certain existing services. The costs compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely increase the future. Claims have been, may be, threatened and filed against under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, product liability, other theories based the nature and content the materials searched and the ads posted our users, our products and services, content generated our users. Furthermore, many these laws not contemplate address the unique issues raised number our new businesses, products, services and technologies. addition, the applicability and scope these laws, interpreted the courts, remain uncertain.

Level Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable the market can derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level Unobservable inputs that are supported little market activities.
