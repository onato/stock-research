ITEM QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK are exposed financial market risks, including changes foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment risks. Due recent financial market movements and changes our expectations near-term possible movements caused the impact COVID-19, are providing update the disclosures made our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk March 31, 2020. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk transact business globally multiple currencies. Our international revenues, well costs and expenses denominated foreign currencies, expose the risk fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, considered the historical trends foreign currency exchange rates and determined that was reasonably possible that adverse changes exchange rates 10% could experienced the near term. use foreign exchange forward contracts offset the foreign exchange risk our assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the local currency the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses the assets and liabilities are recorded other income (expense), net, which are offset the gains and losses the forward contracts. adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied total monetary assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the local currencies the balance sheet dates, would have resulted adverse effect income before income taxes approximately $19 million March 31, 2020. The adverse effect March 31, 2020 after consideration the offsetting effect approximately $474 million from foreign exchange contracts place for the three months ended March 31, 2020. use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised combination purchased and written options) protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements. designate these contracts cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. reflect the gains losses foreign currency spot rate changes component AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues offset the hedged exposures they occur. the U.S. dollar weakened 10% March 31, 2020, the amount recorded AOCI related our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $959 million lower March 31, 2020. The change the value recorded AOCI would expected offset corresponding foreign currency change forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. use foreign exchange forward contracts designated net investment hedges hedge the foreign currency risks related our investment foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations. the U.S. dollar weake ned 10%, the amount recorded cumulative translation adjustment ("CTA") within AOCI related our net investment hedge would have been approximately $928 million lowe March 31, 2020. The change value recorded CTA would expected offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain loss from our investment foreign subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy achieve return that will allow preserve capital and maintain liquidity. invest primarily debt securities including those the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued foreign governments. policy, limit the amount credit exposure any one issuer. Our investments both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry degree interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due rise interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted interest rates fall. Unrealized gains losses our marketable debt securities are primarily due interest rate fluctuations compared interest rates the time purchase. account for both fixed and variable rate securities fair value with gains and losses recorded AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. use value-at-risk ("VaR") analysis determine the potential effect fluctuations interest rates the value our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR the expected loss fair value, for given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due adverse movements interest rates. use variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval.

VaR analysis not intended represent actual losses but used risk estimation. Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject wide variety market-related risks that could substantially reduce increase the fair value our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments privately held companies, some which are the startup development stages. record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method fair value based readily determinable market values, which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject market price volatility, and represent $2.8 billion our investments March 31, 2020. hypothetical adverse price change 30%, which could experienced the near term, would decrease the fair value our marketable equity securities $844 million. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted fair value for observable transactions for identical similar investments the same issuer impairment (referred the measurement alternative). The fair value measured the time the observable transaction not necessarily indication the current fair value the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies products these companies have under development are typically the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience decline financial condition, which could result loss substantial part our investment these companies. The success our investment any private company also typically dependent the likelihood our ability realize appreciation the value our investments through liquidity events such public offerings, acquisitions, private sales other market events. March 31, 2020, the carrying value our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was billion. Valuations our equity investments private companies are inherently more complex due the lack readily available market data. Volatility the global economic climate and financial markets could result significant impairment charge relating our non-marketable equity securities. Changes valuation non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes valuation marketable equity securities. Additionally, observable transactions lower valuations could result significant losses our non-marketable equity securities. The effect COVID-19 our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due the uncertainty around the impact. The carrying values our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion March 31, 2020, generally not fluctuate based market price changes, however these investments could impaired the carrying value exceeds the fair value and not expected recover.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Risks Specific our Company generate significant portion our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending advertisers, loss partners, new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability customize ads could harm our business. generated over 83% total revenues from the display ads online 2019 and 82% the three months ended March 31, 2020. Many our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with any time. These partners may not continue business with not create more value (such increased numbers users customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes our advertising policies and data privacy practices, well changes other companies&#8217; advertising policies practices may affect the advertising that are able provide, which could harm our business. addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult that block the display ads altogether and some providers online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality third-party digital advertising. Failing provide superior value deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. addition, expenditures advertisers tend cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its effects the global economy (as discussed greater detail our COVID-19 risk factor under &#8216;General Risks&#8217; below), can also have material negative effect the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers reduce the amounts they spend advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. face intense competition. not continue innovate and provide products and services that are useful users, may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results. Our business environment rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions rival products and services. compete successfully, must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies timely manner. our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure innovate will encompass wider range products and services. must continue invest significant resources research and development, including through acquisitions, order enhance our technology and new and existing products and services. have many competitors different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories various sectors. They can use their experience and resources ways that could affect our competitive position, including making acquisitions, continuing invest heavily research and development and talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether not meritorious), and continuing compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Our competitors may able innovate and provide products and services faster than can may foresee the need for products and services before us. For example, are investing significantly subscription-based products and services such YouTube, which face intense competition from large experienced companies with well established relationships with users. Our operating results may also suffer our products and services are not responsive the needs our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. technologies continue develop, our competitors may able offer experiences that are, that are seen be, substantially similar better than ours. This may force compete different ways and expend significant resources order remain competitive. our competitors are more successful than are developing compelling products attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could harmed.

Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and may not attain sufficient scale and profitability achieve our business objectives. Within Other Bets, are investing significantly the areas health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not able compete effectively operate sufficient levels profitability. addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all these new ventures are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and anticipate downward pressure our operating margin the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including increasing competition and the continued expansion our business into variety new fields. Changes device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix and increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. may also experience decline our revenue growth rate our revenues increase higher levels, there decrease the rate adoption our products, services, and technologies, due deceleration decline demand for devices used access our services, among other factors. addition, expect that COVID-19 and its effects the global economy will impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed greater detail our COVID-19 risk factor under &#8216;General Risks&#8217; below). addition decline our revenue growth rate, may also experience downward pressure our operating margin resulting from variety factors, such the continued expansion our business into new fields, including products and services such hardware, Google Cloud, Google Play, gaming, and subscription products, well significant investments Other Bets, all which may have margins lower than those generate from advertising. may also experience downward pressure our operating margins from increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects our business, including within advertising where changes such device mix, property mix, and partner agreements can affect margin. The margin earn revenues generated from our Google Network Members could also decrease the future pay larger percentage advertising fees them. may also pay increased TAC our distribution partners well increased content acquisition costs content providers. may also face increase infrastructure costs, supporting businesses such Search, Google Cloud, and YouTube. Many our expenses are less variable nature and may not correlate changes revenues. Table Contents Alphabet Inc. Due these factors and the evolving nature our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not indicative our future performance. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability protect them could reduce the value our products, services and brand well affect our ability compete. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside our control pose threat our intellectual property rights, well our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which our products and services are distributed made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts have taken protect our proprietary rights may not sufficient effective. Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. Furthermore, there always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy such trade secrets and other sensitive information could compromised, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word &#8220;Google&#8221; could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word &#8220;search.&#8221; Some courts have ruled that "Google" protectable trademark, but possible that other courts, particularly those outside the United States, may reach different determination. this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word &#8220;Google&#8221; refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming. Any increase the unauthorized use our intellectual property could make more expensive business and harm our operating results. Our business depends strong brands, and failing maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability expand our base users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed the success our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google and Other Bets increases our ability enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may negatively affected number factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product technical performance failures. For example, fail appropriately respond the sharing misinformation objectionable content our services objectionable practices advertisers, otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence our brands. Our brands may also negatively affected the use our products services disseminate information that deemed false misleading.

Our business could negatively affected are not able engage these companies with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms our arrangements with them. may experience supply shortages and price increases driven raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), and significant changes the financial business condition our suppliers. may experience shortages other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations. addition, some Table Contents Alphabet Inc. the components use our technical infrastructure and products are available only from single source limited sources, and may not able find replacement vendors favorable terms the event supply chain disruption. addition, significant supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades expansions and delay product availability. may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit significant terms and conditions. may liable for materials and products that are not consumed due market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. Our products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, operations. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products and services does not meet expectations our products services are defective, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. require our suppliers and business partners comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such the Google Supplier Code Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. Violations law unethical business practices could result supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm key relationships, and damage our reputation. Their failure procure necessary license rights intellectual property, could affect our ability sell our products services and expose litigation financial claims. Interruption, interference with, failure our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. addition, complications with the design implementation our new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could harm our business and operations. The availability our products and services and fulfillment our customer contracts depend the continuing operation our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable damage, interference, interruption from terrorist attacks, natural disasters pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial service attacks, phishing schemes, other attempts harm access our systems. Some our data centers are located areas with high risk major earthquakes other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts vandalism, and, some cases, potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced facility operators. Some our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence natural disaster pandemic (including COVID-19), closure facility, other unanticipated problems at, impacting, our data centers could result lengthy interruptions our service. addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors vulnerabilities, which could result interruptions failure our services systems. addition, rely extensively information systems and technology manage our business and summarize operating results. are the process multi-year implementation new ERP system, which will replace much our existing core financial systems. The ERP system designed accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow financial information, improve data management, and provide timely information our management team. may not able successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure successfully design and implement the new ERP system planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, not effectively implement the ERP system planned the ERP system does not operate intended, the effectiveness our internal control over financial reporting could negatively affected.
