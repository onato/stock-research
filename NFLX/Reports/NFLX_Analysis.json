Operating margin expanding to 31.5% target in 2026 (vs. 28% recently) with potential for further expansion to 35%+ as scale and ad revenue increase.",

    "Intensifying competition eroding share: Prime Video (20%) now ahead of Netflix (19%) in US streaming share per Q3 2025 data. Disney portfolio at 25% combined (Disney+ + Hulu). Well-funded competitors with deep libraries and vertical integration advantages (Disney parks/merchandise, Amazon retail/Prime bundle, Apple ecosystem).",
    "WBD acquisition execution and regulatory risks: $72-83B deal faces 12-18 month antitrust review with risk of being blocked or requiring major divestitures. Integration of WBD's declining legacy businesses and debt could distract management and destroy value. Massive bet with uncertain outcome.",
    "Content cost inflation pressuring margins: Content spending increasing 10% YoY to $20B in 2026 outpacing revenue growth guidance of 12-14%. Guild agreements, talent costs, and competitive content bidding driving costs higher. Fixed-cost content model creates operating leverage risk if subscriber growth disappoints.",
    "Ad tier cannibalization risk: 55% of new signups choosing $7.99 ad tier vs. $17.99 standard tier represents $10/month ARPU reduction. While ad revenue grows, may not fully offset cannibalization of premium tiers. Ad tier users may be more price-sensitive and churn-prone.",
    "Gaming strategy failure: After 4+ years and significant investment, gaming contributes <0.5% to engagement. Netflix shut down AAA studio in 2024, admitting strategy shift. Pivot to casual party games unlikely to meaningfully move needle. Represents capital and focus distraction from core streaming.",
    "Regulatory and geopolitical headwinds: European content quotas, levies, and data privacy regulations increasing costs. Dutch regulator fine signals compliance challenges. Operating in 190+ countries creates exposure to government censorship, service bans, and local ownership requirements (China notably absent).",
    "Economic sensitivity and pricing ceiling: Premium pricing ($24.99 for top tier) may hit consumer resistance, especially in recession. Streaming becoming table-stakes household expense but discretionary vs. true necessities. Recent price increase could accelerate churn if macro weakens.",
    "Valuation risk at premium multiples: Trading at elevated multiples relative to media peers. Any earnings miss, subscriber growth disappointment, or margin pressure could trigger multiple compression. Stock has had strong run requiring perfect execution to justify current valuation."
