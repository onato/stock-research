                                       Forward-Looking Statements

        This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial
risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not
purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (referred to as the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (referred to as the “Exchange Act”), including, but not limited to, statements
regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions, strategies, future operations, future financial position,
future revenue, projected expenses, and plans and objectives of management. In some cases, you can
identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,”
“objective,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking
statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-
looking statements reflect our current views about future events and involve known risks, uncertainties,
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievement to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled
“Risk Factors” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of such statements.

        As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references
to the “Company,” “Sprouts,” “Sprouts Farmers Market,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sprouts Farmers
Market, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

1. Basis of Presentation
       Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through its subsidiaries, offers a unique
food specialty retail experience featuring an open layout with fresh produce at the heart of the store. The
Company continues to bring the latest in wholesome, innovative products made with lifestyle-friendly
ingredients such as organic, plant-based and gluten-free. As of October 1, 2023, the Company
operated 401 stores in 23 states. For convenience, the “Company” is used to refer collectively to Sprouts
Farmers Market, Inc. and unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries.

        The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) for interim financial statements and are in the form prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of
management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results for any other interim period or for a full fiscal year. The information included in these
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included herein and
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023 (“fiscal year
2022”) included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on March 2, 2023.

       The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not
include all disclosures required by GAAP.

       The Company reports its results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal calendar ending on the
Sunday closest to December 31. The fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) and fiscal
year 2022 are 52-week years. The Company reports its results of operations on a 13-week quarter,
except for 53-week fiscal years (in which the fourth quarter has 14 weeks).

       All dollar amounts are in thousands, unless otherwise noted.

Revision of previously issued financial statements

       The Company identified an error in the financing activities section of its consolidated statements of
cash flows for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, related to the presentation of proceeds from
and repayments of borrowings associated with a modification of the Company's revolving credit facility on
March 25, 2022. The correction of the error did not have any impact on the previously reported
consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, or statements of comprehensive income, nor did it
have any impact on total cash flows from operating activities or used in investing or financing activities.
Although the Company has determined that the error did not have a material impact on its previously
issued consolidated financial statements, the Company revised the presentation of cash flows from
financing activities to reflect the proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility of
$62.5 million as a cash inflow from financing activities, and the repayments of borrowings under the
revolving credit facility of $62.5 million as a cash outflow from financing activities.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
       The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied upon the transfer of goods to the customer,
which occurs at the point of sale, and payment from customers is also due at the time of sale. Proceeds
from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a liability at the time of sale and recognized as sales when they
are redeemed by the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Company. The
Company’s gift cards do not expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable
percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue
is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period
presented. A summary of the activity and balances in the gift card liability, net is as follows:

                                                                                Thirty-nine weeks ended

       (1) net of estimated breakage

       The nature of goods the Company transfers to customers at the point of sale are inventories,
consisting of merchandise purchased for resale.

       The Company does not have any material contract assets or receivables from contracts with
customers, any revenue recognized in the current period from performance obligations satisfied in
previous periods, any contract performance obligations, or any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract
as of October 1, 2023.

Restricted Cash
       Restricted cash relates to the Company's defined benefit plan forfeitures and the Company's
healthcare, general liability and workers’ compensation plan benefits of approximately $2.1 million and
$2.0 million as of October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. These balances are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

       No new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the thirteen weeks ended October
1, 2023 had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

3. Fair Value Measurements
         The Company records its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. This framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value:

       Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

        Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

        Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable.

       Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in
the impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets.

     The following tables present the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2023:

                      October 1, 2023                       Level 1         Level 2        Level 3              Total
    Long-term debt                                      $             — $   150,000 $                 — $       150,000
     Total financial liabilities                        $             — $   150,000 $                 — $       150,000

                      January 1, 2023                       Level 1         Level 2        Level 3              Total
    Long-term debt                                      $             — $   250,000 $                 — $       250,000
     Total financial liabilities                        $             — $   250,000 $                 — $       250,000

        The determination of fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets for purposes of the
Company’s goodwill or long-lived asset impairment evaluation is based upon Level 3 inputs. When
necessary, the Company uses third party market data and market participant assumptions to derive the
fair value of its asset groupings, which primarily include right-of-use lease assets and property and
equipment.
        Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued salaries and benefits approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. Based on comparable open market transactions, the
fair value of the long-term debt approximated carrying value as of October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2023.

4. Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities
           A summary of long-term debt and finance lease liabilities is as follows:

collateral agent (the “Former Credit Facility”), which remained outstanding as of the time of Intermediate
Holdings’ entry into the Credit Agreement, were recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets
and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis to
interest expense over the five-year term of the Credit Agreement.

        The Credit Agreement provides for a $70.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (the "Letter of Credit
Sub-Facility") and a $50.0 million swingline facility. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement
reduce the capacity of Intermediate Holdings to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of
credit totaling $21.5 million have been issued as of October 1, 2023 under the Letter of Credit Sub-
Facility, primarily to support the Company’s insurance programs.

Guarantees
       Obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and substantially all of its
existing and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by first-priority security
interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company, Intermediate Holdings, and the subsidiary
guarantors, including, without limitation, a pledge by the Company of its equity interest in Intermediate
Holdings.

Interest and Fees
        Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, either at the
Term SOFR (with a floor of 0.00%) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 1.00% per annum or base rate
(with a floor of 0.00%) plus 0.00% per annum. The interest rate margins are subject to upward
adjustments pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio as set forth in the
Credit Agreement and to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.05% based upon the achievement
of certain diversity and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

       Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on
the available unused amount of the commitments, which commitment fee ranges between 0.10% to
0.225% per annum, pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The
commitment fees are subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.01% based upon the
achievement of certain diversity and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit
Agreement.

       As of October 1, 2023, loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement bore interest at Term SOFR
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 0.95% per annum.

       As of October 1, 2023, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement were
subject to a participation fee of 0.95% per annum and an issuance fee of 0.125% per annum.

Payments and Borrowings
      The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate on
March 25, 2027, subject to extensions as set forth therein.

     The Company may prepay loans and permanently reduce commitments under the Credit
Agreement at any time in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty (except
SOFR breakage costs, if applicable).

      In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company's obligations under the
Former Credit Facility were prepaid and terminated.

        During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, the Company made no additional
borrowings and made principal payments of $25.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, resulting in
total outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement of $150.0 million as of October 1, 2023. During 2022,
the Company made no additional borrowings or principal payments, other than the net change of
$62.5 million in the composition of the lending syndicate associated with a modification of the Company's
revolving credit facility on March 25, 2022, resulting in total outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement
of $250.0 million as of January 1, 2023.

Covenants
      The Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants. The negative
covenants include, among other things, limitations on the Company’s ability to:
        • incur additional indebtedness;
        • grant additional liens;
        • enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
        • make loans or investments;
        • merge, consolidate or enter into acquisitions;
        • pay dividends or distributions;
        • enter into transactions with affiliates;
        • enter into new lines of business;
        • modify the terms of certain debt or other material agreements; and
        • change its fiscal year.

       Each of these covenants is subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions.

       In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain a
maximum total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00, which ratio may be increased from time to
time in connection with certain permitted acquisitions pursuant to conditions as set forth in the Credit
Agreement, and a minimum interest coverage ratio not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. Each of these
covenants is tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

      The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement as of
October 1, 2023.

5. Income Taxes
        The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 24.0% for the thirteen weeks ended October 1,
2023, compared to 25.6% for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to an increase in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment
awards. The income tax effect resulting from excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards was
$1.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023 and was immaterial for the thirteen weeks
ended October 2, 2022.

        The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 24.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1,
2023 compared to 25.2% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to an increase in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment
awards. The income tax effect resulting from excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards was
$4.2 million and $1.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022,
respectively.

         The Company files income tax returns for federal purposes and in many states. The Company’s
tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time,
generally three years, following the tax year to which those filings relate.

6. Related Party Transactions
       During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, the Company did not have any
material related party transactions.

       On May 24, 2022, the Company appointed a new member to its board of directors who served as
an executive officer of a company that is a supplier of nutrition bars and related products to the Company
for resale. The director departed employment from this supplier on February 28, 2023. The cost of sales
recognized from this supplier during the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022 was $1.2 million and was
$2.5 million from the beginning of the second quarter of 2022 through October 2, 2022.

7. Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company is exposed to claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business
and uses various methods to resolve these matters that are believed to best serve the interests of the
Company’s stakeholders. The Company’s primary contingencies are associated with self-insurance
obligations and litigation matters. Self-insurance liabilities require significant judgment and actual claim
settlements and associated expenses may differ from the Company’s current provisions for loss.

Proposition 65 Coffee Action

        On April 13, 2010, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“CERT”)
filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against nearly 80
defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee, including the Company. CERT
alleged that the defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the
chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. CERT seeks
equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties.

      The Company, as part of a joint defense group, asserted multiple defenses against the lawsuit. On
May 7, 2018, the trial court issued a ruling adverse to defendants on these defenses to liability. On
October 1, 2019, before the court tried damages, remedies and attorneys' fees, California’s Office of
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment adopted a regulation that exempted “Exposures to listed
chemicals in coffee created by and inherent in the processes of roasting coffee beans or brewing coffee”
from Proposition 65’s warning requirement. On August 25, 2020, the court granted the defense motion for
summary judgment based on the regulation, and the case was dismissed.

      On November 20, 2020, CERT filed a notice of appeal to appeal the ruling on the defense motion
for summary judgment. On October 26, 2022, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision. In
December 2022, CERT appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court of the State of California, which denied
the petition for review in February 2023, concluding the matter.

8. Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchases
        On March 2, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $600 million share
repurchase program for its common stock. The new authorization replaced the Company's then-existing
share repurchase authorization of $300 million that was due to expire on March 3, 2024, of which $99.8
million remained available upon its replacement. No further shares may be repurchased under the $300
million authorization. The following table outlines the common stock share repurchase program
authorized by the Company’s board of directors and the related repurchase activity and available
authorization as of October 1, 2023.

        The shares under the Company’s repurchase programs may be purchased on a discretionary
basis from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market
conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The board’s authorization of
the share repurchase programs does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of
common stock, and the repurchase programs may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any
time.

      Share repurchase activity under the Company’s repurchase programs for the periods indicated

       Shares purchased under the Company’s repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the
excess of the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common
shares repurchased during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 included the 1%
excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

       Subsequent to October 1, 2023 and through the date of this filing, the Company repurchased an
additional 0.1 million shares of common stock for $2.8 million.

9. Net Income Per Share
        The computation of basic net income per share is based on the number of weighted average
shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share includes the
dilutive effect of share equivalents consisting of incremental shares deemed outstanding from the
assumed exercise of options and unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Performance share awards
("PSAs") are included in the computation of diluted net income per share only to the extent that the
underlying performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be
satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related performance period, and if the effect
would be dilutive.

       A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share
calculations is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

       In December 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its cash
flow associated with variable interest rates. This forward contract was designated and qualified as a cash
flow hedge, and its change in fair value was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income
and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the forecasted transaction occurred.
The forward contract consisted of five cash flow hedges with a notional dollar amount of $250.0 million,
and each had a length of one year and matured annually from 2018 to 2022.

        The gain or loss on these derivative instruments was recognized in other comprehensive income,
net of tax, with the portion related to current period interest payments reclassified to interest expense, net
on the consolidated statements of income. The following table summarizes these losses classified on the

Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2022 Incentive Plan”), which became effective May 25,
2022, upon approval by the Company’s stockholders. The 2022 Incentive Plan provides team members of
the Company, certain consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company, and non-
employee members of the Company's board of directors with the opportunity to receive grants of equity
awards, including stock options, RSUs, PSAs, and other stock-based awards. The 2022 Incentive Plan

plan for the Company’s share-based and cash-based incentive compensation programs for its directors,
officers and other team members. Upon stockholder approval of the 2022 Incentive Plan on May 25,
2022, no further awards will be granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan, but awards outstanding under the
2013 Incentive Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and the terms of the 2013
Incentive Plan.

      The Company’s goodwill balance was $381.7 million and $368.9 million as of October 1, 2023 and

Farmers Market, Henry’s Farmers Market and Ronald Cohn, Inc. For further details, see Note 16,
"Business Combination".

       A summary of the activity and balances in goodwill is as follows:

                                     Balance at January 1, 2023       Additions                Balance at October 1, 2023

15. Store Closures
        In February 2023, the Company's board of directors approved the closing of 11 stores during
2023, all of which were closed during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. These stores, on
average, were approximately 30% larger than the Company's current prototype format and were
underperforming financially. The closure of these stores resulted in a charge of $27.8 million during the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and right-
of-use assets and is reflected in Store closure and other costs, net on the consolidated statements of
income. The impairment charge represented the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair
value of each store's asset group. Accelerated depreciation on the closed stores' assets during the thirty-
nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 was $5.9 million, and is reflected in Depreciation and amortization on
the consolidated statements of income. Severance expense was immaterial during the thirty-nine weeks
ended October 1, 2023, and no further severance expense is expected to be incurred.

16. Business Combination
        On March 20, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc., a corporation
that owned two stores located in California operating under the ‘Sprouts Farmers Market’ name pursuant
to a legacy trademark license arrangement. The aggregate consideration paid in the transaction
consisted of 0.6 million of the Company’s common shares valued at $18.1 million using the closing price
of the Company's common stock on March 20, 2023 and cash consideration of $13.0 million, subject to
customary post-closing adjustments.

          The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with the
acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the assets and
liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs
were immaterial and were expensed as incurred. The financial results of the acquired stores have been
included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquired
stores' results of operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results during the thirteen
and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023.
       The net purchase price was initially allocated to the net tangible assets of ($4.9) million and a
reacquired right intangible asset of $23.1 million based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition
date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $12.9 million was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
represents the future economic benefits to the Company from the acquisition, which include the
Company's ability to fully control the Sprouts Farmers Market brand by termination of the legacy
trademark license agreement and allowing further expansion opportunities in Southern California. The
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. There have been no material changes to the
purchase price allocation originally recorded in the first quarter of 2023. The provisional fair value
estimates are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained within the measurement period,
which may not exceed twelve months from the acquisition date.

        In 2002, we opened the first Sprouts Farmers Market store in Chandler, Arizona. From our
founding in 2002 through October 1, 2023, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store

Farmers Market stores added in 2011 and 2012, respectively, to the Sprouts banner through acquisitions.
These three businesses all trace their lineage back to Henry’s Farmers Market and were built with similar
store formats and operations including a strong emphasis on value, produce and service in smaller,
convenient locations.

                                               Our Strategy

company and driving profitable growth. We continue to execute on this strategy, focusing on the following
areas:
      •     Win with Target Customers. We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified
            through research as ‘health enthusiasts’ and ‘selective shoppers’, where there is ample
            opportunity to gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can
            continue to grow by leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you,
            quality products and by providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our
            website or the Sprouts app.
      •     Update Format and Expand in Select Markets. We are delivering unique smaller stores with
            expectations of stronger returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer’s
            market heritage Sprouts is known for. We have opened 36 stores and remodeled one store
            featuring our new format through October 1, 2023. Our geographic store expansion and new
            store placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth potential
            and supply chain support, which we believe will provide a long runway of approximately 10%
            annual unit growth beginning in 2024.
      •     Create an Advantaged Fresh Supply Chain. We believe our network of fresh distribution
            centers can drive efficiencies across the chain and support growth plans. To further deliver on
            our fresh commitment and reputation, as well as to increase our local offerings and improve
            financial results, we aspire to ultimately position fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile
            radius of stores. With the opening of two fresh distribution centers in 2021 and the relocation
            of our Southern California distribution center in 2023, we have more than 85% of our stores
            within 250 miles of a distribution center as of October 1, 2023.

      •     Refine Brand and Marketing Approach. We believe we are elevating our national brand
            recognition and positioning by telling our unique brand story rooted in product innovation and
            differentiation. We are increasing our use of data analytics and insights. We believe this data-
            driven intelligence will increase customer engagement through personalization efforts with
            digital and social connections to drive additional sales growth and loyalty.
      •     Inspire and Engage Our Talent to Create a Best Place to Work. Subsequent to the initial
            launch of our long-term growth strategy, we have added the focus area of inspiring and
            engaging our talent through our culture, acquisition and development and total rewards
            program to attract and retain the talent we believe we need to execute on our strategic goals
            and transform our company into a premier place to work.
      •     Deliver on Financial Targets and Box Economics. We are measuring and reporting on the
            success of this strategy against a number of long-term financial and operational targets. With
            the implementation of our strategy beginning in 2020, we have significantly improved our
            margin structure above our 2019 baseline.

                                          Recent Developments
       In the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, as part of our real estate portfolio review, we
closed 11 stores. These stores, on average, were approximately 30% larger than our current prototype
format and were underperforming financially. See Note 15, “Store Closures” of our unaudited
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these store closures.

        Gross profit totaled $625.4 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023, an increase of
$41.8 million, or 7%, compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022, driven by increased sales
volume. Gross margin decreased by 0.2% to 36.5% for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023,
compared to 36.7% for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022. The decrease was driven by higher
distribution costs resulting from our new and recently expanded distribution centers in California and
Texas, respectively.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $42.0 million, or 9%, compared to the
thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the net increase in new stores
opened since the prior year and higher wages and incentive compensation costs.

$31.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023, compared to $30.3 million for the thirteen
weeks ended October 2, 2022. Depreciation and amortization primarily consists of depreciation and
amortization for buildings, store leasehold improvements, and equipment for new stores as well as
remodel initiatives in older stores.

      Interest expense, net decreased to $1.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023,

Income tax provision
        Income tax provision differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax
rate to pretax income as a result of the following:

due to an increase in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment awards.

      Net income decreased $0.4 million primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative
expenses for the reasons discussed above.

     The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.03 was driven by fewer diluted shares outstanding
compared to the prior year, due primarily to the share repurchase program.

        Net sales during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 totaled $5.1 billion, an increase of
$311.2 million, or 6%, over the same period of the prior fiscal year. The sales increase was primarily due
to a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales resulting from an increase in basket value due to retail price
inflation partially offset by a slight reduction in the number of items per basket and the impact of store
closures, as well as sales from new stores opened in the last twelve months. See "Impact of Inflation and
Deflation". Comparable stores contributed approximately 96% of total sales for the thirty-nine weeks
ended October 1, 2023 and approximately 97% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022.

$125.7 million, or 7%, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, driven by increased
sales volume. Gross margin increased to 37.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023,
compared to 36.8% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, due to favorable product mix and
continued promotional optimization, partially offset by higher distribution costs resulting from our new and
recently expanded distribution centers in California and Texas, respectively.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $104.1 million, or 8%, compared to the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the net increase in new
stores opened since the prior year period and higher payroll costs.

      Interest expense, net decreased to $6.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023,
compared to $7.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 primarily due to higher interest
income earned as a result of higher interest rates and lower credit facility fees. See Note 4, “Long-Term
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Income tax provision
        Income tax provision differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax
rate to pretax income as a result of the following:

       The effective tax rate decreased to 24.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 from
25.2% in the same period last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an
increase in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment awards.

      The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.04 was driven by fewer diluted shares outstanding
compared to the prior year due primarily to the share repurchase program, partially offset by lower net

                                        Return on Invested Capital
        In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP, we provide information regarding Return on Invested Capital (referred to as “ROIC”)
as additional information about our operating results. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure and should
not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in
accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment
returns on capital and provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over
time.

        We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (referred to as “NOPAT”), including the effect of
capitalized operating leases, divided by average invested capital. Operating lease interest represents the
add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property
under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as a finance lease. The assumed ownership
and associated interest expense are calculated using the discount rate for each lease as recorded as a
component of rent expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Invested capital reflects a
trailing four-quarter average.

       As numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC, our method may differ from methods used by
other companies to calculate their ROIC. It is important to understand the methods and the differences in
those methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of
other companies.

       Our calculation of ROIC for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:

                                                                              Rolling Four Quarters Ended

                                     Liquidity and Capital Resources
       The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth
below, as well as our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of each period (in thousands):

                                                                                  Thirty-nine weeks ended

Cash flows used in financing activities                                     $     (272,320)    $      (154,993)

       We have generally financed our operations principally through cash generated from operations
and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory,
operating expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores, remodels and maintenance,
repurchases of our common stock and debt service. Our principal contractual obligations and
commitments consist of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement,
operating and finance leases, purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Our operating and
finance leases for the rental of land, buildings, and for rental of facilities and equipment expire or become
subject to renewal clauses at various dates through 2044. We believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash, and cash anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to
meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including new store openings, remodel and maintenance capital expenditures at
existing stores, store initiatives and other corporate capital expenditures and activities. Our cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to
customers the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within days from the related
sale.

Operating Activities
        Cash flows from operating activities increased $102.2 million to $409.0 million for the thirty-nine
weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to $306.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2,
2022. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of changes in working
capital and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items.

        Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities from changes in working capital were $70.8
million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to ($6.9 million) in the thirty-nine weeks
ended October 2, 2022. The increase was driven by prepaid expenses and other current assets,
inventories and accrued liabilities.

Investing Activities
       Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures in new stores,
including leasehold improvements and store equipment, capital expenditures to maintain the appearance
of our stores, sales enhancing initiatives and other corporate investments as well as cash outlays for
acquisitions. Cash flows used in investing activities were $178.0 million and $80.7 million, for the thirty-
nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively.

Table of Contents



       We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $190 - $210 million in 2023, including
expenditures incurred to date, net of estimated landlord tenant improvement allowances, primarily to fund
investments in new stores, remodels, maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital
expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from
operating activities.

Financing Activities
        Cash flows used in financing activities were $272.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October
1, 2023 compared to $155.0 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022. During the thirty-
nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of $180.4
million for stock repurchases and $100.0 million in payments on our Credit Agreement, partially offset by
$8.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

       During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, cash flows used in financing activities
primarily consisted of $155.1 million for stock repurchases and $3.4 million in debt issuance costs in
connection with our Credit Agreement, partially offset by $4.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of
stock options.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities
      Long-term debt outstanding was $150.0 million as of October 1, 2023 and $250.0 million as of
January 1, 2023.

       See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated
financial statements for a description of our Credit Agreement and our Former Credit Facility (each as
defined therein).

Share Repurchase Program
       Our board of directors from time to time authorizes share repurchase programs for our common
stock. The following table outlines the share repurchase program authorized by our board, and the related
repurchase activity and available authorization as of October 1, 2023.

                                                              Amount                 Cost of            Authorization

       The shares under our current repurchase program may be purchased on a discretionary basis
from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market
conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Our board’s authorization of
the share repurchase program does not obligate our Company to acquire any particular amount of
common stock, and the repurchase program may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any
time.

        Share repurchase activity under our repurchase program for the periods indicated was as follows

       Shares purchased under our repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the excess of
the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares
repurchased during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 included the 1% excise tax
imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

        Subsequent to October 1, 2023 and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an additional
0.1 million shares of common stock for $2.8 million.

Contractual Obligations
       Our principal contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business
consist of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and
finance leases, purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. There have been no material
changes outside the normal course of business as of October 1, 2023 in our contractual obligations and
commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1,
2023.

        The future amount and timing of interest payments are expected to vary with the outstanding
amounts and then prevailing contractual interest rates. Interest payments through the March 25, 2027
maturity date of our Credit Agreement based on the outstanding amounts as of October 1, 2023 and
interest rates in effect at the time of this filing, are estimated to be approximately $28.3 million, with $9.4
million payable within 12 months.

                                      Impact of Inflation and Deflation
        Inflation and deflation in the prices of food and other products we sell may periodically affect our
sales, gross profit and gross margin. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending,
could also reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. Inflationary pressures on
compensation, utilities, commodities, equipment and supplies may also impact our profitability. Food
deflation or declining levels of inflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce, could reduce
sales growth and earnings, particularly if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and
expanding their promotional activities, which can lead to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that
could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. The short-term impact of
inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether or not the effects are passed through to our
customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions.

        Food inflation and deflation is affected by a variety of factors and our determination of whether to
pass on the effects of inflation or deflation to our customers is made in conjunction with our overall pricing
and marketing strategies, as well as our competitors’ responses. Although we may experience periodic
effects on sales, gross profit, gross margins and cash flows as a result of changing prices, including
pressures we experienced in fiscal 2022 and continue to experience in fiscal 2023 due to product cost
inflation which we largely passed along to retail pricing, we do not expect the effect of inflation or deflation
to have a material impact on our ability to execute our long-term business strategy.


                                       Critical Accounting Estimates

       Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses,
cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting estimates
include inventories, lease assumptions, self-insurance reserves, goodwill and intangible assets,
impairment of long-lived assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these
estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.

Table of Contents



        There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during
the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. For a full discussion of these estimates and
policies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended January 1, 2023.

                             Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

       See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
       As described in Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Credit
Agreement bears interest at a rate based in part on SOFR. Accordingly, we could be exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates. Based solely on the $150.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit
Agreement as of October 1, 2023, each hundred basis point change in SOFR would result in a change in
interest expense by $1.5 million annually.

       This sensitivity analysis assumes our mix of financial instruments and all other variables will
remain constant in future periods. These assumptions are made in order to facilitate the analysis and are
not necessarily indicative of our future intentions.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
        We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange
Act as of October 1, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

control over financial reporting.

                                    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
       From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and
employment issues, product liability, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although
management does not expect that the outcome in these proceedings will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we
could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could materially impact our results.

      See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our unaudited consolidated financial
statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
         Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties referenced below, together with
all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial
statements and related notes. Any of those risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
operating results, financial condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline,
which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.

       There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described under “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023.
