                                          Forward-Looking Statements

         This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial risks
and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(referred to as the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(referred to as the “Exchange Act”), including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs,
intentions, strategies, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected expenses, and plans
and objectives of management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,”
“could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “objective,” or the negative of these terms, and similar
expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements
contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events
and involve known risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity,
performance, or achievement to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report.
Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

       As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to the
“Company,” “Sprouts,” “Sprouts Farmers Market,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.
and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
          The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied upon the transfer of goods to the customer, which
occurs at the point of sale, and payment from customers is also due at the time of sale. Proceeds from the sale
of gift cards are recorded as a liability at the time of sale and recognized as sales when they are redeemed by
the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Company. The Company’s gift cards do not
expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable percentage of gift cards will never be
redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to
actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period presented. A summary of the activity and
balances in the gift card liability, net is as follows:

                                                                                         Thirteen weeks ended

       The nature of goods the Company transfers to customers at the point of sale are inventories, consisting
of merchandise purchased for resale.

        The Company does not have any material contract assets or receivables from contracts with customers,
any revenue recognized in the current period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, any
contract performance obligations, or any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract as of March 30, 2025.


Restricted Cash
        Restricted cash relates to the Company's defined benefit plan forfeitures and the Company's
healthcare, general liability and workers’ compensation plan benefits of $2.1 million as of March 30, 2025 and
December 29, 2024. These balances are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
consolidated balance sheets.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

         In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU no. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures." The amendments in this update enhance a public entity's annual income tax
disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The guidance will be
effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance should be
applied prospectively, with an option to apply it retrospectively. The Company expects this update to impact its
income tax disclosures but does not anticipate that this update will impact its results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition.

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

           In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU no. 2024-03, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive
Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement
Expenses". The standard requires public entities to disclose additional disaggregation of expense in the notes
to the financial statements for interim and annual reporting periods. The guidance is effective for the Company
for its fiscal year 2027. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance should be applied prospectively, with an
option to apply it retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on its
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

       No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the thirteen weeks ended
March 30, 2025 had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.


3. Fair Value Measurements
         The Company records its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with GAAP. This framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value:

           Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

         Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

         Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable.

       Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in the
impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets.

       The Company did not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
March 30, 2025 and December 29, 2024.

        The determination of fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets for purposes of the Company’s
goodwill or long-lived asset impairment evaluation is based upon Level 3 inputs. When necessary, the Company
uses third party market data and market participant assumptions to derive the fair value of its asset groupings,
which primarily include right-of-use lease assets and property and equipment.

         Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued salaries and benefits approximate fair value because
of the short maturity of those instruments.

                                          (UNAUDITED)
Credit Agreement
         The Company’s subsidiary, Sprouts Farmers Markets Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate Holdings”), is the
borrower under a credit agreement entered into on March 25, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit
Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with an initial aggregate
commitment of $700.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be increased from time to
time in accordance with an expansion feature set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         The Company capitalized debt issuance costs of $3.4 million related to the Credit Agreement, which,
combined with the remaining $0.5 million debt issuance costs in respect of that certain amended and restated
credit agreement entered into on March 27, 2018, by and among the Company, Intermediate Holdings, certain
lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (the
“Former Credit Facility”), which remained outstanding as of the time of Intermediate Holdings’ entry into the
Credit Agreement, were recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the five-
year term of the Credit Agreement.

         The Credit Agreement provides for a $70.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (the "Letter of Credit Sub-
Facility") and a $50.0 million swingline facility. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce the
capacity of Intermediate Holdings to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of credit totaling $21.6
million have been issued as of March 30, 2025 under the Letter of Credit Sub-Facility, primarily to support the
Company’s insurance programs.


Guarantees
         Obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and substantially all of its
existing and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by first-priority security
interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company, Intermediate Holdings, and the subsidiary guarantors,
including, without limitation, a pledge by the Company of its equity interest in Intermediate Holdings.


Interest and Fees
         Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, either at the Term
SOFR (with a floor of 0.00%) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 1.00% per annum or base rate (with a floor of
0.00%) plus 0.00% per annum. The interest rate margins are subject to upward adjustments pursuant to a
pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio as set forth in the Credit Agreement and to upward
or downward adjustments of up to 0.05% based upon the achievement of certain diversity and sustainability-
linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the
available unused amount of the commitments, which commitment fee ranges between 0.10% to 0.225% per
annum, pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The commitment fees are
subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.01% based upon the achievement of certain diversity
and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

        As of March 30, 2025, loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement bore interest at Term SOFR (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 0.95% per annum. The Company had no
loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of March 30, 2025.

         As of March 30, 2025, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement were subject to a
participation fee of 0.95% per annum and an issuance fee of 0.125% per annum.


Payments and Borrowings
       The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate on
March 25, 2027, subject to extensions as set forth therein.

          The Company may prepay loans and permanently reduce commitments under the Credit Agreement at
any time in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty (except SOFR breakage
costs, if applicable).

        In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company's obligations under the Former
Credit Facility were prepaid and terminated.

        During the thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025, the Company made no additional borrowings and had
no outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement as of March 30, 2025. During 2024, the Company made no
additional borrowings and made principal payments of $125.0 million, resulting in no outstanding debt under the
Credit Agreement as of December 29, 2024.


Covenants
         The Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants
include, among other things, limitations on the Company’s ability to:
         •          incur additional indebtedness;
         •          grant additional liens;
         •          enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
         •          make loans or investments;
         •          merge, consolidate or enter into acquisitions;
         •          pay dividends or distributions;
         •          enter into transactions with affiliates;
         •          enter into new lines of business;
         •          modify the terms of certain debt or other material agreements; and
         •          change its fiscal year.

         Each of these covenants is subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions.

         In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain a maximum
total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00, which ratio may be increased from time to time in connection
with certain permitted acquisitions pursuant to conditions as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and a minimum
interest coverage ratio not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. Each of these covenants is tested as of the last day of
each fiscal quarter.

       The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement as of
March 30, 2025.


5. Income Taxes
         The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 20.8% for the thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025,
compared to 22.6% for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was
primarily due to an increase in benefit from current year stock-based compensation partially offset by an
increase in non-deductible executive compensation. The income tax effect resulting from excess tax benefits of
share-based payment awards was $12.8 million and $4.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025
and March 31, 2024, respectively.

          The Company files income tax returns for federal purposes and in many states. The Company’s tax
filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time, generally three
years, with some exceptions, following the tax year to which those filings relate.



                                                               12

6. Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company is exposed to claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business and
uses various methods to resolve these matters that are believed to best serve the interests of the Company’s
stakeholders. The Company’s primary contingencies are associated with self-insurance obligations and litigation
matters. Self-insurance liabilities require significant judgment and actual claim settlements and associated
expenses may differ from the Company’s current provisions for loss.
Litigation
         In February 2025, the Company terminated its agreement with Harvest Sherwood Food Distributors,
Inc. (“Harvest Sherwood”) for the distribution of certain meat and seafood products to the Company due to,
among other things, Harvest Sherwood’s failure to pay the Company’s vendors for these products.
Subsequently, on February 24, 2025, Harvest Sherwood filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior
Court for the State of Delaware alleging breach of contract among other claims and seeking monetary
damages. On March 6, 2025, the Company filed an answer and counterclaims against Harvest Sherwood,
asserting its defenses to the complaint and its claims against Harvest Sherwood for breach of contract,
negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment, among others. The court has set a trial date in February
2026. At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is unable to predict or reasonably estimate any potential
loss or effect on the Company. Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter.


7. Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchases
         On May 22, 2024, the Company's board of directors authorized a $600 million share repurchase
program for its common stock. The new authorization replaced the Company's then-existing share repurchase
authorization of $600 million that was due to expire on December 31, 2024, of which $119.3 million remained
available upon its replacement, and under which no further shares may be repurchased. The following table
outlines the common stock share repurchase programs authorized by the Company’s board of directors and the
related repurchase activity and available authorization as of March 30, 2025:

         The shares under the Company’s repurchase programs may be purchased on a discretionary basis
from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market conditions and
other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other
means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The board’s authorization of the share repurchase
programs does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the
repurchase programs may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

         Share repurchase activity under the Company’s repurchase programs for the periods indicated was as
follows (total cost in thousands):

                                                                                        Thirteen weeks ended

       Shares purchased under the Company’s repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the
excess of the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares
repurchased included the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

         Subsequent to March 30, 2025 and through April 28, 2025, the Company repurchased an additional
0.3 million shares of common stock for $53.0 million, excluding excise tax.


8. Net Income Per Share
         The computation of basic net income per share is based on the number of weighted average shares
outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share includes the dilutive effect of
share equivalents consisting of incremental shares deemed outstanding from the assumed exercise of options
and unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Performance share awards ("PSAs") are included in the
computation of diluted net income per share only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are
satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the
end of the related performance period, and if the effect would be dilutive.

         A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share
calculations is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

                                                                                            Thirteen weeks ended

9. Segments
         The Company has one operating segment and, therefore, one reportable segment: healthy grocery
stores. The Company derives all its revenues from the sale of products at its various store locations across the
United States. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer. The
CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on consolidated net income. The measure of
segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.
       In accordance with ASC 280, the following table represents the significant expense and key metrics
reviewed by the CODM:

                                                  Business Overview

fresh produce at the heart of the store. Sprouts inspires wellness naturally with a carefully curated assortment of
better-for-you products paired with purpose-driven people. We continue to bring the latest in wholesome,
innovative products made with lifestyle-friendly ingredients such as organic, plant-based and gluten-free. From
our founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability.
Headquartered in Phoenix with 443 stores in 24 states as of March 30, 2025, we are one of the largest and
fastest growing specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States.


                                                 Our Growth Strategy
        We continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy that we believe is transforming our company
and driving profitable growth, focusing on the following areas:
         •          Win with Target Customers. We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified
                    through research as ‘health enthusiasts’ and ‘selective shoppers’, where there is ample
                    opportunity to gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can
                    continue to grow by leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you,
                    quality products and by providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our
                    website or the Sprouts app.
         •          Market Expansion. We are delivering unique smaller stores with expectations of stronger
                    returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer’s market heritage Sprouts is
                    known for. From 2021 through March 30, 2025, we have opened 78 new stores and remodeled
                    one store featuring our updated format. Our geographic store expansion and new store
                    placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth potential and
                    supply chain support, which we believe will provide a long runway of approximately 10% annual
                    unit growth.
         •          Create an Advantaged Supply Chain. We believe our network of distribution centers can drive
                    efficiencies across the chain and support our growth plans. To further deliver on our fresh
                    commitment and reputation, as well as to increase our local offerings and improve financial
                    results, we aspire to ultimately position fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile radius of
                    stores. We are better leveraging our existing distribution center capacity, and approximately
                    80% of our stores were within 250 miles of a distribution center as of March 30, 2025.
         •          Customer Engagement and Personalization. We believe we are elevating our national brand
                    recognition and positioning by telling our unique brand story rooted in product innovation and
                    differentiation. We are increasing our use of data analytics and insights. We believe this data-
                    driven intelligence will increase customer engagement through personalization efforts with
                    digital and social connections to drive additional sales growth and loyalty.
         •          Inspire and Engage Our Talent to Make Sprouts a Best Place to Work. Subsequent to the initial
                    launch of our long-term growth strategy, we have added the focus area of inspiring and
                    engaging our talent through our culture, acquisition and development and total rewards
                    program to attract and retain the talent we believe we need to execute on our strategic goals
                    and transform our company into a premier place to work.
         •          Invest in Technology for Growth. We continue to make investments in technology in support of
                    our strategy, with a focus on enhancing efficiency, scalability, and customer experience. While
                    we are showing positive outcomes on our strategic investments in inventory management and
                    customer personalization, we believe that ongoing investments in our technology foundation will
                    allow us to streamline operations and improve decision making to execute on our strategy.

increase in benefit from current year stock-based compensation partially offset by an increase in non-deductible
executive compensation.


Net income

                                                           Thirteen weeks ended

        Net income increased $65.9 million primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling,
general and administrative expenses for the reasons discussed above.


Diluted earnings per share

        The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.69 was driven by higher net income and fewer diluted
shares outstanding compared to the prior year, due primarily to the share repurchase program.


                                           Return on Invested Capital
         In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP, we provide information regarding Return on Invested Capital (referred to as “ROIC”) as additional
information about our operating results. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be reviewed in
isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an
important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital and provides a
meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time.

         We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (referred to as “NOPAT”), including the effect of
capitalized operating leases, divided by average invested capital. Operating lease interest represents the add-
back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our
operating leases were owned or accounted for as a finance lease. The assumed ownership and associated
interest expense are calculated using the discount rate for each lease as recorded as a component of rent
expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Invested capital reflects a trailing four-quarter
average.

       As numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC, our method may differ from methods used by other
companies to calculate their ROIC. It is important to understand the methods and the differences in those
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of other
companies.

         We have generally financed our operations principally through cash generated from operations and
borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory, operating
expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores, remodels and maintenance, repurchases of
our common stock and debt service. Our principal contractual obligations and commitments consist of
obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases,
purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Our operating and finance leases for the rental of land,
buildings, and for rental of facilities and equipment expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various
dates through 2048. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and cash
anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the
next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including new store openings,
remodel and maintenance capital expenditures at existing stores, store initiatives and other corporate capital
expenditures and activities. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash position benefits from the fact that
we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card
transactions, within days from the related sale.

Operating Activities
         Cash flows from operating activities increased $79.4 million to $299.1 million for the thirteen weeks
ended March 30, 2025 compared to $219.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024. The increase
in cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items of
$75.3 million and favorable changes in working capital of $9.9 million, partially offset by higher payments on our
operating lease liabilities of $4.7 million due to growth.

         Cash flows provided by operating activities from changes in working capital were $77.9 million in the
thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025 compared to $68.0 million in the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024.
This $9.9 million increase in cash flows from changes in working capital was primarily attributable to $25.1
million change in accrued income taxes, $13.6 million change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
primarily due to timing differences of payments for goods and services and $2.2 million change in accounts
receivable driven by the timing of collections. These increases were partially offset by $14.9 million change in
prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily driven by switching from a new prepaid tax position to a net
payable position and $12.1 million change in accrued salaries and benefits primarily driven by increased
corporate bonuses. Certain other immaterial items combined to result in an additional $4.0 million net increase
in cash flows from changes in working capital.

Investing Activities
         Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures in new stores, including
leasehold improvements and store equipment, capital expenditures to maintain the appearance of our stores,
sales enhancing initiatives and other corporate investments as well as cash outlays for acquisitions. Cash flows
used in investing activities were $59.5 million and $51.2 million, for the thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025
and thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024, respectively.

         We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $230 - 250 million in 2025, including expenditures
incurred to date, net of estimated landlord tenant improvement allowances, primarily to fund investments in new
stores, remodels, maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures. We expect to fund our
capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from operating activities.


Financing Activities

       Cash flows used in financing activities were $219.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025
compared to $58.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024. During the thirteen weeks ended
March 30, 2025, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of $218.8 million for stock
repurchases.

        During the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024, cash flows used in financing activities primarily
consisted of $60.0 million for stock repurchases, partially offset by $2.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of
stock options.

                                        Impact of Inflation and Deflation
          Inflation and deflation in the prices of food and other products we sell may periodically affect our sales,
gross profit and gross margin. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending, could also
reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. Inflationary pressures on compensation, utilities,
commodities, equipment and supplies may also impact our profitability. Food deflation or declining levels of
inflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce, could reduce sales growth and earnings, particularly
if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and expanding their promotional activities, which can lead
to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and comparable
store sales. The short-term impact of inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether or not the effects
are passed through to our customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions.

          Food inflation and deflation is affected by a variety of factors and our determination of whether to pass
on the effects of inflation or deflation to our customers is made in conjunction with our overall pricing and
marketing strategies, as well as our competitors’ responses. Although we may experience periodic effects on
sales, gross profit, gross margins and cash flows as a result of changing prices, we do not expect the effect of
inflation or deflation to have a material impact on our ability to execute our long-term business strategy.


                                         Critical Accounting Estimates
         Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, cash flow
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting estimates include inventories,
lease assumptions, self-insurance reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets,
and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial
statements will be affected.

         There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during the
thirteen weeks ended March 30, 2025. For a full discussion of these estimates and policies, see “Critical
Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29,
2024.


                                Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
         See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
         As described in Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” to our unaudited consolidated
financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Credit Agreement bears
interest at a rate based in part on SOFR. Accordingly, we could be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. As
of March 30, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement.


Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
         We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal
executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of
March 30, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
         During the quarterly period ended March 30, 2025, there were no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

                                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
         From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and
employment issues, product liability, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although management does
not expect that the outcome in these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we could incur judgments or enter into
settlements of claims that could materially impact our results.
        See Note 6, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for
information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.


Item 1A. Risk Factors.
         Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties referenced below, together with all of the
other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and
related notes. Any of those risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial
condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline, which could cause you to lose all
or part of your investment.

        There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described under “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024.
