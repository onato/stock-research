                                          Forward-Looking Statements

         This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial risks
and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(referred to as the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(referred to as the “Exchange Act”), including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs,
intentions, strategies, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected expenses, and plans
and objectives of management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,”
“could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “objective,” or the negative of these terms, and similar
expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements
contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events
and involve known risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity,
performance, or achievement to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and our other filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report.
Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

       As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to the
“Company,” “Sprouts,” “Sprouts Farmers Market,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.
and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
          The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied upon the transfer of goods to the customer, which
occurs at the point of sale, and payment from customers is also due at the time of sale. Proceeds from the sale
of gift cards are recorded as a liability at the time of sale and recognized as sales when they are redeemed by
the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Company. The Company’s gift cards do not
expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable percentage of gift cards will never be
redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to
actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period presented. A summary of the activity and
balances in the gift card liability, net is as follows:

                                                                                             Thirteen weeks ended

       The nature of goods the Company transfers to customers at the point of sale are inventories, consisting
of merchandise purchased for resale.

        The Company does not have any material contract assets or receivables from contracts with customers,
any revenue recognized in the current period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, any
contract performance obligations, or any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract as of March 31, 2024.


Restricted Cash
        Restricted cash relates to the Company's defined benefit plan forfeitures and the Company's
healthcare, general liability and workers’ compensation plan benefits of $2.1 million as of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023. These balances are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
consolidated balance sheets.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

         In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU no. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements
to Reportable Segment Disclosures." The amendments in this update increase required disclosures about a
public entity's reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses
that are regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU
2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM. The guidance will be effective
for the Company for its fiscal year 2024 and for interim periods starting in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025.
Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance is required to be applied retrospectively. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

         In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU no. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures." The amendments in this update enhance a public entity's annual income tax
disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The guidance will be
effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance should be
applied prospectively, with an option to apply it retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

       No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the thirteen weeks ended
March 31, 2024 had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.


3. Fair Value Measurements
         The Company records its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with GAAP. This framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value:

         Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

         Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

         Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable.

       Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in the
impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets.

         The following tables present the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

                     March 31, 2024                      Level 1         Level 2          Level 3          Total

      Total financial liabilities                    $             — $     125,000 $                — $    125,000


                    December 31, 2023                    Level 1         Level 2          Level 3          Total
    Long-term debt                                   $             — $     125,000 $                — $    125,000
     Total financial liabilities                     $             — $     125,000 $                — $    125,000

        The determination of fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets for purposes of the Company’s
goodwill or long-lived asset impairment evaluation is based upon Level 3 inputs. When necessary, the Company
uses third party market data and market participant assumptions to derive the fair value of its asset groupings,
which primarily include right-of-use lease assets and property and equipment.

         Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued salaries and benefits approximate fair value because
of the short maturity of those instruments. Based on comparable open market transactions, the fair value of the
long-term debt approximated carrying value as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Credit Agreement
         The Company’s subsidiary, Sprouts Farmers Markets Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate Holdings”), is the
borrower under a credit agreement entered into on March 25, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit
Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with an initial aggregate
commitment of $700.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be increased from time to
time in accordance with an expansion feature set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         The Company capitalized debt issuance costs of $3.4 million related to the Credit Agreement, which,
combined with the remaining $0.5 million debt issuance costs in respect of that certain amended and restated
credit agreement entered into on March 27, 2018, by and among the Company, Intermediate Holdings, certain
lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (the
“Former Credit Facility”), which remained outstanding as of the time of Intermediate Holdings’ entry into the
Credit Agreement, were recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the five-
year term of the Credit Agreement.

         The Credit Agreement provides for a $70.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (the "Letter of Credit Sub-
Facility") and a $50.0 million swingline facility. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce the
capacity of Intermediate Holdings to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of credit totaling $21.3
million have been issued as of March 31, 2024 under the Letter of Credit Sub-Facility, primarily to support the
Company’s insurance programs.


Guarantees
         Obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and substantially all of its
existing and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by first-priority security
interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company, Intermediate Holdings, and the subsidiary guarantors,
including, without limitation, a pledge by the Company of its equity interest in Intermediate Holdings.


Interest and Fees
         Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, either at the Term
SOFR (with a floor of 0.00%) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 1.00% per annum or base rate (with a floor of
0.00%) plus 0.00% per annum. The interest rate margins are subject to upward adjustments pursuant to a
pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio as set forth in the Credit Agreement and to upward
or downward adjustments of up to 0.05% based upon the achievement of certain diversity and sustainability-
linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the
available unused amount of the commitments, which commitment fee ranges between 0.10% to 0.225% per
annum, pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The commitment fees are
subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.01% based upon the achievement of certain diversity
and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

        As of March 31, 2024, loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement bore interest at Term SOFR (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 0.95% per annum.

         As of March 31, 2024, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement were subject to a
participation fee of 0.95% per annum and an issuance fee of 0.125% per annum.


Payments and Borrowings
       The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate on
March 25, 2027, subject to extensions as set forth therein.

          The Company may prepay loans and permanently reduce commitments under the Credit Agreement at
any time in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty (except SOFR breakage
costs, if applicable).

        In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company's obligations under the Former
Credit Facility were prepaid and terminated.

        During the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024, the Company made no additional borrowings or
principal payments, resulting in total outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement of $125.0 million as of
March 31, 2024. During 2023, the Company made no additional borrowings and made principal payments of
$125.0 million, resulting in total outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement of $125.0 million as of
December 31, 2023.


Covenants
         The Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants
include, among other things, limitations on the Company’s ability to:
         •          incur additional indebtedness;
         •          grant additional liens;
         •          enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
         •          make loans or investments;
         •          merge, consolidate or enter into acquisitions;
         •          pay dividends or distributions;
         •          enter into transactions with affiliates;
         •          enter into new lines of business;
         •          modify the terms of certain debt or other material agreements; and
         •          change its fiscal year.

         Each of these covenants is subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions.




                                                               12

                                          (UNAUDITED)
         In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain a maximum
total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00, which ratio may be increased from time to time in connection
with certain permitted acquisitions pursuant to conditions as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and a minimum
interest coverage ratio not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. Each of these covenants is tested as of the last day of
each fiscal quarter.

       The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement as of
March 31, 2024.


5. Income Taxes
         The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 22.6% for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024,
compared to 23.3% for the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was
primarily due to an increase in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment awards. The income
tax effect resulting from excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards was $4.5 million and $2.6 million
for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024 and April 2, 2023, respectively.

          The Company files income tax returns for federal purposes and in many states. The Company’s tax
filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time, generally three
years, following the tax year to which those filings relate.


6. Related Party Transactions
        During the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not have any material related party
transactions.

         On May 24, 2022, the Company appointed a new member to its board of directors who served as an
executive officer of a company that is a supplier of nutrition bars and related products to the Company for
resale. The director departed employment from this supplier on February 28, 2023. The cost of sales
recognized from this supplier during the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023 was immaterial.


7. Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company is exposed to claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business and
uses various methods to resolve these matters that are believed to best serve the interests of the Company’s
stakeholders. The Company’s primary contingencies are associated with self-insurance obligations and litigation
matters. Self-insurance liabilities require significant judgment and actual claim settlements and associated
expenses may differ from the Company’s current provisions for loss.


8. Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchases
        On March 2, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $600 million share repurchase
program for its common stock. This authorization replaced the Company's then-existing share repurchase
authorization of $300 million that was due to expire on March 3, 2024, of which $99.8 million remained available
upon its replacement. No further shares may be repurchased under the $300 million authorization. The following
table outlines the common stock share repurchase program authorized by the Company’s board of directors
and the related repurchase activity and available authorization as of March 31, 2024:

         The shares under the Company’s repurchase programs may be purchased on a discretionary basis
from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market conditions and
other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other
means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The board’s authorization of the share repurchase
programs does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the
repurchase programs may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

         Share repurchase activity under the Company’s repurchase programs for the periods indicated was as
follows (total cost in thousands):

       Shares purchased under the Company’s repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the
excess of the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares
repurchased included the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

        Subsequent to March 31, 2024 and through the date of this filing, the Company repurchased an
additional 0.3 million shares of common stock for $21.5 million, excluding excise tax.


9. Net Income Per Share
         The computation of basic net income per share is based on the number of weighted average shares
outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share includes the dilutive effect of
share equivalents consisting of incremental shares deemed outstanding from the assumed exercise of options
and unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Performance share awards ("PSAs") are included in the
computation of diluted net income per share only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are
satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the
end of the related performance period, and if the effect would be dilutive.

         A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share
calculations is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

and 0.4 million PSAs outstanding which were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as
those awards would have been antidilutive or were performance awards with performance conditions not yet
deemed met. For the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023, the Company had 0.4 million options, 0.4 million
RSUs and 0.5 million PSAs outstanding which were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per
share as those awards would have been antidilutive or were performance awards with performance conditions

approval by the Company’s stockholders. The 2022 Incentive Plan provides team members of the Company,
certain consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company, and non-employee members of the
Company's board of directors with the opportunity to receive grants of equity awards, including stock options,
RSUs, PSAs, and other stock-based awards. The 2022 Incentive Plan replaced the 2013 Incentive Plan (as

         The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued to team members and directors
under the 2022 Incentive Plan may not exceed 6,600,000, subject to the following adjustments. If any awards
granted under the 2022 Incentive Plan, terminate, expire, or are cancelled, forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered
without having been exercised, vested or paid in shares, the shares will again be available for purposes of the
2022 Incentive Plan. The number of shares subject to outstanding awards under the Sprouts Farmers Market,
Inc. 2013 Incentive Plan (the “2013 Incentive Plan”) that terminate, expire, are paid in cash, or are cancelled,
forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered without having been exercised, vested, or paid in shares under the 2013
Incentive Plan after the effective date of the 2022 Incentive Plan will be available for issuance under the 2022
Incentive Plan. As of March 31, 2024, there were 1,134,570 stock awards outstanding and 5,517,416 shares
remaining available for issuance under the 2022 Incentive Plan.


2013 Incentive Plan
        Prior to the adoption of the 2022 Incentive Plan, the 2013 Incentive Plan served as the umbrella plan for
the Company’s share-based and cash-based incentive compensation programs for its directors, officers and
other team members. Upon stockholder approval of the 2022 Incentive Plan on May 25, 2022, no further
awards will be granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan, but awards outstanding under the 2013 Incentive Plan
will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and the terms of the 2013 Incentive Plan.


Stock Options
        The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options at grant
date. Options vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the grant letter.

         Time-based options vest annually over a period of three years.


RSUs
      The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.
RSUs generally vest annually over a period of two or three years from the grant date.


PSAs
         PSAs granted in 2020 were subject to the Company achieving certain earnings before taxes (“EBT”)
performance targets for the 2022 fiscal year. The criteria was based on a range of performance targets in which
grantees may earn 0% to 200% of the base number of awards granted. The performance conditions with
respect to fiscal year 2022 EBT were deemed to have been met, and the PSAs vested at the maximum pay out
level on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 2023). There were no outstanding 2020 PSAs as of
March 31, 2024.

         PSAs granted in 2021 were subject to the Company achieving certain earnings before interest and
taxes ("EBIT") performance targets for the 2023 fiscal year. The criteria was based on a range of performance
targets in which grantees may earn 0% to 200% of the base number of awards granted. The performance
conditions with respect to fiscal year 2023 EBIT were deemed not to have been met. Accordingly, no PSAs
vested on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 2024). There were no outstanding 2021 PSAs as of
March 31, 2024.

        PSAs granted in 2022 are subject to the Company achieving certain EBIT performance targets for the
2024 fiscal year. The criteria is based on a range of performance targets in which grantees may earn 0% to
200% of the base number of awards granted. If performance conditions are met, the applicable number of
performance shares will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 2025).

        PSAs granted in 2023 are subject to the Company achieving certain EBIT performance targets for the
2025 fiscal year. The criteria is based on a range of performance targets in which grantees may earn 0% to
200% of the base number of awards granted. If performance conditions are met, the applicable number of
performance shares will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 2026).

13. Store Closures
         In February 2023, the Company's board of directors approved the closing of 11 stores, all of which were
closed during 2023. These stores, on average, were approximately 30% larger than the Company's current
prototype format and were underperforming financially. The closure of these stores resulted in a charge of $27.8
million during the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023 related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and
right-of-use assets and was reflected in Store closure and other costs, net on the consolidated statements of
income. The impairment charge represented the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of
each store's asset group. Accelerated depreciation on the closed stores' assets during 2023 was $5.9 million, of
which $4.0 million was incurred during the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023 and was reflected in Depreciation
and amortization on the consolidated statements of income. Severance expense during 2023 was immaterial.


14. Business Combination
       On March 20, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc., a corporation that
owned two stores located in California operating under the ‘Sprouts Farmers Market’ name pursuant to a legacy
trademark license arrangement. The aggregate consideration paid in the transaction consisted of 0.6 million of
the Company’s common shares valued at $18.1 million using the closing price of the Company's common stock
on March 20, 2023 and cash consideration of $13.0 million.

           The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with the
acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the assets and
liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs were
immaterial and were expensed as incurred. The financial results of the acquired stores have been included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquired stores' results of
operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results.

         The net purchase price was allocated to the net tangible assets of ($4.9) million and a reacquired right
intangible asset of $23.1 million based on their fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated
net purchase price of $12.9 million was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits
to the Company from the acquisition, which include the Company's ability to fully control the Sprouts Farmers
Market brand by termination of the legacy trademark license agreement and allowing further expansion
opportunities in Southern California. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The final
allocation of the purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been
completed and included an immaterial amount of measurement period adjustments.

                                                  Business Overview

                                                  Our Growth Strategy
        We continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy that we believe is transforming our company
and driving profitable growth, focusing on the following areas:
         •          Win with Target Customers. We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified
                    through research as ‘health enthusiasts’ and ‘selective shoppers’, where there is ample
                    opportunity to gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can
                    continue to grow by leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you,
                    quality products and by providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our
                    website or the Sprouts app.
         •          Update Format and Expand in Select Markets. We are delivering unique smaller stores with
                    expectations of stronger returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer’s
                    market heritage Sprouts is known for. From 2021 through March 31, 2024, we opened 49 new
                    stores and remodeled one store featuring our new format. Our geographic store expansion and
                    new store placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth
                    potential and supply chain support, which we believe will provide a long runway of
                    approximately 10% annual unit growth.
         •          Create an Advantaged Fresh Supply Chain. We believe our network of fresh distribution
                    centers can drive efficiencies across the chain and support our growth plans. To further deliver
                    on our fresh commitment and reputation, as well as to increase our local offerings and improve
                    financial results, we aspire to ultimately position fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile
                    radius of stores. Following the opening of two fresh distribution centers in fiscal 2021 and the
                    relocation of our Southern California distribution center, closure of our Georgia distribution
                    center and partnership with a third-party fresh distribution center in the Northeast in fiscal 2023,
                    we are better leveraging our existing distribution center capacity, and approximately 80% of our
                    stores were within 250 miles of a distribution center as of March 31, 2024.
         •          Refine Brand and Marketing Approach. We believe we are elevating our national brand
                    recognition and positioning by telling our unique brand story rooted in product innovation and
                    differentiation. We are increasing our use of data analytics and insights. We believe this data-
                    driven intelligence will increase customer engagement through personalization efforts with
                    digital and social connections to drive additional sales growth and loyalty.
         •          Inspire and Engage Our Talent to Create a Best Place to Work. Subsequent to the initial launch
                    of our long-term growth strategy, we have added the focus area of inspiring and engaging our
                    talent through our culture, acquisition and development and total rewards program to attract
                    and retain the talent we believe we need to execute on our strategic goals and transform our
                    company into a premier place to work.

         •          Deliver on Financial Targets and Box Economics. We are measuring and reporting on the
                    success of this strategy against a number of long-term financial and operational targets. With
                    the implementation of our strategy beginning in 2020, we have significantly improved our
                    margin structure above our 2019 baseline.

Gross margin increased by 0.8% to 38.3% for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024, compared to 37.5% for

         Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $53.6 million or 11%, compared to the thirteen
weeks ended April 2, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new stores opened since the end
of the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased primarily due to higher holiday pay related to calendar shift in the New Year's Day holiday and higher
incentive compensation costs and ecommerce fees due to strong sales performance.

         The effective tax rate decreased to 22.6% for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024 from 23.3% for
the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase
in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment awards.


Net income

                                                          Thirteen weeks ended
                                                     March 31, 2024    April 2, 2023      Change          % Change
Net income                                           $ 114,100    $       76,160    $      37,940                  50 %

        Net income increased $37.9 million primarily due to higher gross profit and lower store closure and
other costs, net, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses for the reasons
discussed above.


Diluted earnings per share

                                                          Thirteen weeks ended
                                                     March 31, 2024    April 2, 2023      Change          % Change

        The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.39 was driven by higher net income and fewer diluted
shares outstanding compared to the prior year, due primarily to the share repurchase program.


                                          Return on Invested Capital
         In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP, we provide information regarding Return on Invested Capital (referred to as “ROIC”) as additional
information about our operating results. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be reviewed in
isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an
important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital and provides a
meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time.




                                                         23
Table of Contents



         We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (referred to as “NOPAT”), including the effect of
capitalized operating leases, divided by average invested capital. Operating lease interest represents the add-
back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our
operating leases were owned or accounted for as a finance lease. The assumed ownership and associated
interest expense are calculated using the discount rate for each lease as recorded as a component of rent
expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Invested capital reflects a trailing four-quarter
average.

       As numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC, our method may differ from methods used by other
companies to calculate their ROIC. It is important to understand the methods and the differences in those
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of other
companies.

         Our calculation of ROIC for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:

                                        Liquidity and Capital Resources
        The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth
below, as well as our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of each period (in thousands):

                                                                                           Thirteen weeks ended

Cash flows used in investing activities                                              $     (51,241) $       (60,086)
Cash flows used in financing activities                                              $     (57,970) $      (118,080)

         We have generally financed our operations principally through cash generated from operations and
borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory, operating
expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores, remodels and maintenance, repurchases of
our common stock and debt service. Our principal contractual obligations and commitments consist of
obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases,
purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Our operating and finance leases for the rental of land,
buildings, and for rental of facilities and equipment expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various
dates through 2044. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and cash
anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the
next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including new store openings,
remodel and maintenance capital expenditures at existing stores, store initiatives and other corporate capital
expenditures and activities. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash position benefits from the fact that
we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card
transactions, within days from the related sale.

Operating Activities
         Cash flows from operating activities increased $39.9 million to $219.7 million for the thirteen weeks
ended March 31, 2024 compared to $179.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023. The increase in
cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of favorable changes in working capital of $30.1
million and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items of $15.9 million.

         Cash flows provided by operating activities from changes in working capital were $68.0 million in the
thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024 compared to $37.9 million in the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023. This
$30.1 million increase in cash flow from changes in working capital was primarily attributable to a $19.7 million
change in accrued liabilities primarily due to timing differences of payments for goods and services. Certain
other immaterial items combined to result in an additional $10.4 million net increase in cash flows from changes
in working capital.

Investing Activities
         Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures in new stores, including
leasehold improvements and store equipment, capital expenditures to maintain the appearance of our stores,
sales enhancing initiatives and other corporate investments as well as cash outlays for acquisitions. Cash flows
used in investing activities were $51.2 million and $60.1 million, for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024
and thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023, respectively. Cash flows used in investing activities during the thirteen
weeks ended April 2, 2023 included our acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc. See Note 14, "Business Combination"
of our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

         We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $225 - $245 million in 2024, including expenditures
incurred to date, net of estimated landlord tenant improvement allowances, primarily to fund investments in new
stores, remodels, maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures. We expect to fund our
capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from operating activities.

Financing Activities

       Cash flows used in financing activities were $58.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024
compared to $118.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023. During the thirteen weeks ended
March 31, 2024, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of $60.0 million for stock
repurchases, partially offset by $2.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

        During the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2023, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted
of $98.3 million for stock repurchases and $25.0 million in payments on our Credit Agreement, partially offset by
$5.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.


Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities
         Long-term debt outstanding was $125.0 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

       See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated financial
statements for a description of our Credit Agreement and our Former Credit Facility (each as defined therein).


Share Repurchase Program
         Our board of directors from time to time authorizes share repurchase programs for our common stock.
The following table outlines the share repurchase program authorized by our board, and the related repurchase
activity and available authorization as of March 31, 2024:

                                                      Amount                  Cost of                 Authorization

         The shares under our current repurchase program may be purchased on a discretionary basis from
time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market conditions and other
investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means,
including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Our board’s authorization of the share repurchase program does
not obligate our Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may
be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

         Share repurchase activity under our repurchase program for the periods indicated was as follows (total
cost in thousands):

        Shares purchased under our repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the excess of the
repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares repurchased
included the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

         Subsequent to March 31, 2024 and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an additional
0.3 million shares of common stock for $21.5 million, excluding excise tax.

Contractual Obligations
         Our principal contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business consist
of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases,
purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. There have been no material changes outside the normal
course of business as of March 31, 2024 in our contractual obligations and commitments from those reported in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

         The future amount and timing of interest payments are expected to vary with the outstanding amounts
and then prevailing contractual interest rates. Interest payments through the March 25, 2027 maturity date of
our Credit Agreement based on the outstanding amounts as of March 31, 2024 and interest rates in effect at the
time of this filing, are estimated to be approximately $20.8 million, with $8.0 million payable within 12 months.


                                        Impact of Inflation and Deflation
          Inflation and deflation in the prices of food and other products we sell may periodically affect our sales,
gross profit and gross margin. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending, could also
reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. Inflationary pressures on compensation, utilities,
commodities, equipment and supplies may also impact our profitability. Food deflation or declining levels of
inflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce, could reduce sales growth and earnings, particularly
if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and expanding their promotional activities, which can lead
to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and comparable
store sales. The short-term impact of inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether or not the effects
are passed through to our customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions.

          Food inflation and deflation is affected by a variety of factors and our determination of whether to pass
on the effects of inflation or deflation to our customers is made in conjunction with our overall pricing and
marketing strategies, as well as our competitors’ responses. Although we may experience periodic effects on
sales, gross profit, gross margins and cash flows as a result of changing prices, we do not expect the effect of
inflation or deflation to have a material impact on our ability to execute our long-term business strategy.


                                         Critical Accounting Estimates
         Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, cash flow
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting estimates include inventories,
lease assumptions, self-insurance reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets,
and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial
statements will be affected.

         There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during the
thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2024. For a full discussion of these estimates and policies, see “Critical
Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023.

         See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
         As described in Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” to our unaudited consolidated
financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Credit Agreement bears
interest at a rate based in part on SOFR. Accordingly, we could be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
Based solely on the $125.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2024,
each hundred basis point change in SOFR would result in a change in interest expense by $1.25 million
annually.

       This sensitivity analysis assumes our mix of financial instruments and all other variables will remain
constant in future periods. These assumptions are made in order to facilitate the analysis and are not
necessarily indicative of our future intentions.


Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
         We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal
executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of
March 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
         During the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

                                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
         From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and
employment issues, product liability, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although management does
not expect that the outcome in these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we could incur judgments or enter into
settlements of claims that could materially impact our results.


Item 1A. Risk Factors.
         Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties referenced below, together with all of the
other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and
related notes. Any of those risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial
condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline, which could cause you to lose all
or part of your investment.

        There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described under “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

                         All Performance Shares will cease vesting as of the date your
                         employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Employer”)
                         has terminated for any reason, except as set forth herein.

                         Disability, in each case, as provided for below) or if you engage in
                         Specified Conduct (as defined in Exhibit A) prior to the Certification
                         Date, you shall forfeit all rights to receive any Performance Shares.

                         Date or if you engage in Specified Conduct after the Certification
                         Date, you shall forfeit all Performance Shares that are not then
                         vested, and such Performance Shares shall be returned to the

Change in Control   In the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may take such
                    actions with respect to the Performance Shares as it deems
                    appropriate pursuant to the Plan. Absent other action by the
                    Committee:

                        (A) if there occurs a Change in Control, and this award is not
                            continued or assumed by, or replaced with an award that has
                            comparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a parent
                            or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) in accordance with
                            the Plan, then (i) if the Change in Control occurs prior to the
                            Certification Date, you will become vested, immediately prior
                            to the Change in Control, in the greater of (x) the Target
                            Number of Performance Shares, or (y) the number of
                            Performance Shares which would have been earned based
                            on the Company’s actual achievement of the performance
                            metric(s) set forth in the Cover Sheet, and (ii) if the Change
                            in Control occurs after the Certification Date, all Performance
                            Shares that have not yet vested shall vest immediately prior
                            to the Change in Control; and
                        (B) if there occurs a Change in Control, and this award
                            continues or is assumed by, or replaced with an award that
                            has comparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a
                            parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) in
                            accordance with the Plan and your employment is
                            terminated by the Employer without Cause or by you for
                            Good Reason, in each case within 24 months following the
                            Change in Control, then (i) upon such termination, you will
                            become vested in the greater of (x) the Target Number of
                            Performance Shares, or (y) the number of Performance
                            Shares which would have been earned based on the
                            Company’s actual achievement of the performance metric(s)
                            set forth in the Cover Sheet through the date of such
                            termination, and (ii) if such termination occurs after the
                            Certification Date, all Performance Shares that have not yet
                            vested shall vest immediately upon such termination.

                    For purposes of the foregoing, this award shall not be treated as
                    continued, assumed or replaced on comparable terms unless it is
                    continued, assumed or replaced with substantially equivalent terms,
                    including, without limitation, continuation, replacement or assumption
                    of the same Company performance metrics set forth in the Cover
                    Sheet, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Plan.

                      as follows:

                             upon such termination you will become vested in a pro-rated
                             number of Performance Shares that is equal to: (i) the
                             greater of (x) the Target Number of Performance Shares, or
                             (y) the number of Performance Shares which would have
                             been earned based on the Company’s actual achievement of
                             the performance metric(s) set forth in the Cover Sheet

                             elapsed between the Grant Date and the termination date,
                             and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
                             performance period; or
                         (B) if such termination occurs on or after the Certification Date,

                             the Certification Date but have not yet vested shall vest upon
                             such termination.

Taxes   Unless you make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within
        30 days of the Certification Date, the value of the Performance
        Shares as and when they vest will be treated as wages subject to
        payroll withholding. The Company will satisfy the withholding
        obligation through a “sell to cover” whereby you irrevocably direct a
        securities broker approved by the Company to sell a portion of your
        Performance Shares that are then scheduled to vest and to deliver
        the sale proceeds to the Company in payment of the applicable
        withholding taxes. You agree to provide these directions by signing
        and returning the Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares attached
        hereto, along with a signed copy of the Cover Sheet, within 60 days
        of the Grant Date.

        The number of Shares that the broker will sell will be based on an
        estimate made by the broker of the Shares required to be sold to
        satisfy the withholding taxes. You agree that the proceeds received
        from the sale of Shares will be used to satisfy the withholding taxes
        and, accordingly, you authorize the broker to pay such proceeds to
        the Company for such purpose. To the extent that the proceeds
        obtained by such sale exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the
        withholding taxes, such excess proceeds shall be deposited into your
        brokerage account and in the event of a shortfall, additional Shares
        may be sold and/or cash withholding may be required from you. Any
        remaining Shares shall be deposited into your brokerage account.

        If there is not a market in the Shares or the Company determines in
        its sole discretion that the sell to cover procedure is not advisable or
        sufficient, the Company will have the right to make other
        arrangements to satisfy the withholding taxes due upon the vesting
        of the Shares with respect to the Performance Shares, including, but
        not limited to, the right to deduct amounts from salary or payments of
        any kind otherwise due to you or withhold in Shares (by transferring
        Shares back to the Company), provided that the Company only
        withholds the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the statutory
        minimum withholding amount or such other amount as permitted by
        the Committee.         If such other arrangements are made, your
        Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares will be voided.

        You represent to the Company that, as of the date you sign the
        Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares, you are not aware of any
        material nonpublic information about the Company or the Shares.
        You and the Company have structured this Agreement to constitute a
        “binding contract” relating to the sale of Shares, consistent with the
        affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Exchange
        Act under Rule 10b5-1(c) issued under such Act.

Restrictions on        By signing this Agreement, you agree not to sell any Performance
Resale                 Shares at a time when applicable laws, regulations or Company
                       policies prohibit a sale.

                       In addition, until the Performance Shares have vested pursuant to
                       the schedule set forth in the Cover Sheet, they may not be sold,
                       transferred, assigned, pledged, margined, or otherwise encumbered
                       or disposed of (except for transfers and forfeitures to the Company).

                       The Company’s obligation to issue Performance Shares upon the
                       Certification Date shall be subject to applicable laws, rules and
                       regulations and also to such approvals by governmental agencies as
                       may be deemed appropriate to comply with relevant securities laws
                       and regulations.

                       You shall deliver to the Chief Legal Officer of the Company, at the
                       time of execution of this Agreement and/or at such other time or
                       times as the Chief Legal Officer may request, one or more executed
                       stock powers, authorizing the transfer of the Performance Shares to
                       the Company upon forfeiture, and you shall take such other steps or
                       perform such other actions as may be requested by the Chief Legal
                       Officer to effect the transfer of any forfeited Performance Shares.

Transfer of right to   Prior to the Vesting Date as set forth on the Cover Sheet, you cannot
receive Performance    transfer or assign your right to receive Performance Shares. For
Shares                 instance, you may not sell your right to Performance Shares or use
                       such right as security for a loan. If you attempt to do any of these
                       things, your award will immediately become invalid.

                       Regardless of any marital property settlement agreement, the
                       Company or a securities broker, as applicable, is not obligated to
                       recognize your former spouse’s interest in your right to Performance
                       Shares in any way.

Stockholder Rights;    You, or your estate or heirs, have no rights as a stockholder of the
Dividend Equivalent    Company in respect of Performance Shares until the Certification
Rights                 Date. No adjustments are made for dividends or other rights if the
                       applicable record date occurs before Shares are issued, except as
                       described in the Plan.

                       On and following the Certification Date, you shall have the rights as a
                       stockholder, subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement
                       (including, without limitation, transfer restrictions and forfeiture during
                       the vesting period); provided that, any dividends declared with
                       respect to the Performance Shares issued to you shall be paid only if
                       and to the extent that such Performance Shares vest.

Applicable Law         This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the
                       State of Delaware.

Company Policies       This Agreement, the Performance Shares and any other Shares or

                       other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to

                    IRREVOCABLE STANDING ORDER TO SELL SHARES

I have been granted an award in respect of Performance Shares (“Performance Shares”) by
Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (the “Company”), which is evidenced by a performance share
award agreement between me and the Company (the “Agreement,” copy attached). Provided
that I remain employed by the Company on the applicable vesting date, the shares vest according
to the provisions of the Agreement.

I understand that on the Certification Date (as defined in the Agreement), the Performance
Shares will be deposited into my account at E*TRADE or such other broker the Company may
engage at such time (the “Broker”) and that on the applicable vesting date following the
Certification Date (or my earlier termination of employment under certain circumstances set forth
in the Agreement), I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, on
the vesting date or earlier termination of employment, as applicable, I must sell a number of
shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I
hereby direct the Broker to sell, at the market price and on the vesting date or termination
of employment, as applicable, (or the first business day thereafter if the applicable date
date should fall on a day when the market is closed), the number of Shares that the
Company informs the Broker is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes,
which shall be calculated based on the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on
the last trading day before the vesting date or termination date, as applicable. I understand
that the Broker will remit the proceeds to the Company for payment of the withholding taxes.

I understand and agree that by signing below, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell
Shares which will remain in effect until the vesting date. I also agree that this Irrevocable
Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any
existing Account Agreement that I have with the Broker.
