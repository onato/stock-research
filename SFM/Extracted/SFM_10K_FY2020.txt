                                To our Shareholders,
                                We have a passionate and purpose-driven team here at Sprouts, and it has been an incredible privilege to lead a
                                company rooted in improving the health of the communities it serves. Last year, our 35,000 team members achieved
                                another year of record sales and earnings despite enormous uncertainty spurred by a global pandemic. Our success
                                would not be possible without our team members’ devotion, passion, and hard work. I am incredibly proud of how our
                                teams came together to deliver fantastic results for our shareholders, all while improving access to healthy food across
                                the country.
                                Sprouts is not a traditional grocery store; we are a unique brand offering the latest in fresh, wholesome, and innovative
                                products. Over the last two decades, we have remained true to our farm-stand heritage by providing a differentiated
                                grocery experience with a carefully curated assortment of healthy alternatives and good-for-you options.

COVID-19: PRIORITIZING THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND CUSTOMERS
We’re so grateful to our team members serving our communities during these times. As the global crisis unfolded, we moved quickly to safeguard our team
members. We’ve protected their safety by investing more than $12 million in COVID protective measures, including installing plexiglass partitions, providing
PPE, increasing store security, and establishing enhanced cleanliness protocols. We recognized team member eﬀorts through additional beneﬁts that
included paying more than $100 million in expedited bonuses, increased paid sick time, and 100% testing cost coverage. We also took steps to protect their
ﬁnancial wellbeing by creating a disaster relief fund to help team members in need and provided grants totaling more than $12 million in ﬁnancial support.

DELIVERING ON OUR STRATEGY IN 2020
The world changed during the pandemic, and as we reﬂect on the year, the events of 2020 have only made Sprouts stronger.
We were able to accelerate our strategic initiatives more quickly than initially planned due to the pandemic. Implementing our strategy at a rapid pace
fueled our remarkable results in 2020. Our top-line grew 15% to $6.5 billion in sales, and we delivered an increase of 99% in adjusted diluted earnings per
share to $2.49, including a rapid increase in e-commerce sales, and 22 new store openings.
Early in 2020, we stopped our print ads to speed up our marketing strategy for the long run as we swi ly shi ed to digital channels permanently. We’ve created
signiﬁcantly more personal digital touchpoints through our new customer targeting tools, helping us reach our target customers more eﬀectively. And the shi
from print to digital also helped us achieve a positive environmental impact through saving paper and averting 60,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.
In August we released a new brand campaign – “Sprouts, Where Goodness GrowsTM”, and launched our ﬁrst ever TV commercials, doubling brand awareness
and reaching more customers. This new approach resulted in an increase of 48% active customer emails and 200% total CRM growth, showing that we are
accelerating the reach of our Sprouts brand while continuing to provide value to our customers.
We created a full omnichannel experience, providing our customers the opportunity to shop the way that works best for them, whether through in-store,
home delivery, or curbside pick-up. Our quick rollout of curbside pick-up in all of our stores, combined with the release of shopping through our own
website, shop.sprouts.com, resulted in e-commerce sales growing to over 9% of our total sales, up more than 290% compared to last year.
Our go-to-market strategy has changed with our thoughtful approach to beer everyday pricing, purposeful promotions and geing back to our roots of a
produce buying organization, which is nimble and ﬂexible. These changes have positively changed our ﬁnancials for the long-term. We have now established
a solid base from which we can invest and grow, exiting 2020 ahead or our original strategic plan and in a much stronger position than we began.
Even considering these incredible results, what excites me most is what lies ahead!

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM SPROUTS IN 2021
Going forward, our continued focus on our strategy will be to win with our target customer through improved analytics, establishing ourselves as the
destination for innovation and successfully operating in more locations across the country supported by more local distribution centers. As our customer
database evolves, we will have a beer understanding of our customers’ shopping behaviors. We will continue our strategy of elevating our brand awareness
and reach more of our target customer base through digital-driven communications.
Innovation drives our assortment and our diﬀerentiated products (nearly 68% of our products are aribute-driven!) set us apart from the competition. Our
in-depth category work this past year anticipating trends and identifying products that are preferred by our target customer are helping to position us as a
source for product and brand innovation. In 2021 we’ll keep innovation top of mind as we continue our enhanced category review process to ensure we not
only oﬀer the high-quality products our customers want, but display them in the way that works best for how they shop our stores.
We’ll continue to expand at a rate that remains one of the best in grocery and across retail in 2021. We plan to open approximately 20 new stores this year,
a handful of which will be in our new format with a smaller footprint of 25,000 square feet or less and beer returns. Beyond 2021, we are targeting annual
growth of 10% or more. We’ll continue highlighting our open layout and farmers’ market experience with produce at the heart of the store and an innovation
center to showcase our diﬀerentiated product oﬀerings.
Lastly, we will open two new fresh distribution centers this year. This will drive us closer to our goal of having our stores within 250 miles of our DCs to
create an advantaged, fast, and fresh supply chain. Regional DCs will also help us support community/neighborhood farmers and grow our local produce
oﬀerings as we expand the selection of unique regional produce our customers are looking for, while guaranteeing freshness of all products.
Looking ahead, we know that the world will look very diﬀerent on the other side of this crisis, and we will remain unwavering in our team members’ and
customers’ safety protocols. Although we are only in the early innings of our strategy, we entered 2021 on a solid foundation. I am excited about all that we
are building on this great brand! The focus on health and wellness is here to stay, which bodes well for our diﬀerentiated store model that will support our
future growth prospects to provide broader access to healthy living and creating value for our shareholders.

Sincerely,




Jack Sinclair,
Chief Executive Oﬃcer

      Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all
of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial
statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects and cause the value of our
common stock to decline.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our business and could negatively impact
our financial condition.
General economic conditions that impact consumer spending or result in competitive responses
could adversely affect our business.




Our failure to compete successfully in our competitive industry may adversely affect our revenues
and profitability.
We rely heavily on sales of fresh produce and quality natural and organic products, and product
supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on our profitability and operating results.




The current geographic concentration of our stores creates an exposure to local or regional
downturns or catastrophic occurrences.
Fluctuations in commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.




A widespread health epidemic or other incidents beyond our control could materially impact our
business.




We may require additional capital to fund the expansion of our business, and our inability to
obtain such capital could harm our business.




Increasing energy costs, unless offset by more efficient usage or other operational responses,
may impact our profitability.
                                  %XVLQHVV DQG 2SHUDWLQJ 5LVNV

Our continued growth largely depends on new store openings, and our failure to successfully
open new stores could negatively impact our business.




We may be unable to maintain or increase comparable store sales, which could negatively impact
our business and stock price.




Disruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.
Any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution centers or supply chain network
could disrupt our ability to deliver our produce and other products in a timely manner.




Disruptions to, security breaches or non-compliance involving, our information technology
systems could harm our ability to run our business and expose us to potential liability and loss of
revenues.
Real or perceived concerns that products we sell could cause unexpected side effects, illness,
injury or death could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could
result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation.




If we are unable to successfully identify market trends and react to changing consumer
preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decrease.

     •

     •




Our newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term, and may
not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our more mature stores on a timely basis
or at all.
We may be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins, which could adversely affect our
financial condition and ability to grow.




If we fail to maintain our reputation and the value of our brand, our sales may decline.




The loss of key management could negatively affect our business.




If we are unable to attract, train and retain team members, we may not be able to grow or
successfully operate our business.
Union attempts to organize our team members could negatively affect our business.




Higher wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our business.




Our lease obligations could adversely affect our financial performance and may require us to
continue paying rent for store locations that we no longer operate.




Claims under our insurance plans may differ from our estimates, which could materially impact
our results of operations.
We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, which
could adversely impact our business.




Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our operational flexibility.

We, as well as our vendors, are subject to numerous laws and regulations and our compliance
with these laws and regulations may increase our costs, limit or eliminate our ability to sell certain
products, raise regulatory enforcement risks not present in the past, or otherwise adversely affect
our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are also subject to laws and regulations more generally applicable to retailers. Compliance
with or changes to such laws and regulations may increase our costs, limit or eliminate our ability
to sell certain products or otherwise adversely affect our business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition or cash flows.




Legal proceedings could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.
We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our
business.




Changes in accounting standards may materially impact reporting of our financial condition and
results of operations.




                                                           Leases


If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may
fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case
investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the
market price of our common stock may decline.
If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a
significant charge to earnings.




Our nutrition-oriented educational activities may be impacted by government regulation or our
inability to secure adequate liability insurance.




                                &RPPRQ 6WRFN 2ZQHUVKLS 5LVNV
Our stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the
price you paid for them or at all.
Anti-takeover provisions could impair a takeover attempt and adversely affect existing
stockholders.

If securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or
our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock
price and trading volume could decline.




Since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, investors may be
forced to sell their stock in order to obtain a return on their investment.




Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.
