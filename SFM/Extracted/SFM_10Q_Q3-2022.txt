                                       Forward-Looking Statements

        This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial
risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not
purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (referred to as the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (referred to as the “Exchange Act”), including, but not limited to, statements
regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions, strategies, future operations, future financial position,
future revenue, projected expenses, and plans and objectives of management. In some cases, you can
identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,”
“objective,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking
statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-
looking statements reflect our current views about future events and involve known risks, uncertainties,
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievement to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled
“Risk Factors” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of such statements.

        As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references
to the “Company,” “Sprouts,” “Sprouts Farmers Market,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sprouts Farmers
Market, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
       The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied upon the transfer of goods to the customer,
which occurs at the point of sale, and payment from customers is also due at the time of sale. Proceeds
from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a liability at the time of sale and recognized as sales when they
are redeemed by the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Company. The
Company’s gift cards do not expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable
percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue
is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period
presented.

                                               Gift Cards Issued During
                               Balance at       Current Period but Not    Revenue Recognized from     Balance at

        (1) net of estimated breakage

       The Company does not have any material contract assets or receivables from contracts with
customers, any revenue recognized in the current period from performance obligations satisfied in
previous periods, or any remaining performance obligations as of October 2, 2022.

Restricted Cash
       Restricted cash relates to defined benefit plan forfeitures as well as healthcare, general liability
and workers’ compensation restricted funds of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million as of October
2, 2022 and January 2, 2022, respectively. These balances are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Reference Rate Reform
        In March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU no. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform
(Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and ASU 2021-
01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,” respectively. The amendments in these updates
provide optional expedients and exceptions for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in
accounting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform.
In the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, the Company adopted certain optional expedients
provided under Topic 848 that permit its hedging relationships to continue without de-designation upon
changes due to reference rate reform. The adoption of this guidance resulted in no material impact to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 10, “Derivative Financial Instruments” for more
information on our hedging activities. The optional expedients and accounting relief in Topic 848 remain
effective through December 31, 2022.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

      No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the thirteen weeks ended
October 2, 2022 had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

3. Fair Value Measurements
         The Company records its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. This framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value:

       Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

        Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

        Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable.

       Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in
the valuation of derivative instruments, impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived
assets.

     The following tables present the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 2, 2022 and January 2, 2022:

                    October 2, 2022                     Level 1           Level 2        Level 3           Total

     Total assets                                   $             —   $        687   $             —   $       687

                    January 2, 2022                     Level 1           Level 2        Level 3           Total
   Long-term debt                                   $             — $      250,000 $               — $     250,000
   Interest rate swap liability                                   —          5,107                 —         5,107
     Total financial liabilities                    $             — $      255,107 $               — $     255,107

       The Company’s interest rate swaps are considered Level 2 in the hierarchy and are valued using
an income approach. Expected future cash flows are converted to a present value amount based on
market expectations of the yield curve on floating interest rates, which is readily available on public
markets.
      The determination of fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets for purposes of the
Company’s goodwill impairment evaluation as described above is based upon Level 3 inputs. The
weighted average cost of capital is estimated using information from comparable companies and
management’s judgment related to the risk associated with the operations of the stores.
        Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued salaries and benefits approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. Based on comparable open market transactions, the
fair value of the long-term debt approximated carrying value as of October 2, 2022 and January 2, 2022.

New Credit Agreement
       The Company’s subsidiary, Sprouts Farmers Markets Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate Holdings”), is
the borrower under a credit agreement entered into on March 25, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”). The
Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with an initial
aggregate commitment of $700.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be
increased from time to time in accordance with an expansion feature set forth in the Credit Agreement.

        The Company capitalized debt issuance costs of $3.4 million related to the Credit Agreement,
which, combined with the remaining $0.5 million debt issuance costs in respect of that certain amended
and restated credit agreement entered into on March 27, 2018, by and among the Company, Intermediate
Holdings, certain lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and
collateral agent (the “Former Credit Facility”), which remained outstanding as of the time of Intermediate
Holdings’ entry into the Credit Agreement, are being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense
over the five-year term of the Credit Agreement.

        The Credit Agreement provides for a $70.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (the "Letter of Credit
Sub-Facility") and a $50.0 million swingline facility. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement
reduce the capacity of Intermediate Holdings to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of
credit totaling $24.8 million have been issued as of October 2, 2022 under the Letter of Credit Sub-
Facility, primarily to support the Company’s insurance programs.

Guarantees
       Obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and substantially all of its
existing and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by first-priority security

Interest and Fees
        Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, either at the
Term SOFR (with a floor of 0.00%) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 1.00% per annum or base rate
(with a floor of 0.00%) plus 0.00% per annum. The interest rate margins are subject to upward
adjustments pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio as set forth in the
Credit Agreement and to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.05% based upon the achievement
of certain diversity and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
       Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on
the available unused amount of the commitments, which commitment fee ranges between 0.10% to
0.225% per annum, pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The
commitment fees are subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.01% based upon the
achievement of certain diversity and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit
Agreement.
       As of October 2, 2022, loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement bore interest at Term SOFR
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 1.00% per annum.

        The effective interest rate on 100% of outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement is fixed,
reflecting the effects of floating to fixed interest rate swaps (see Note 10, “Derivative Financial
Instruments”).

       As of October 2, 2022, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement were
subject to a participation fee of 1.00% per annum and an issuance fee of 0.125% per annum.

Payments and Borrowings
      The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate on
March 25, 2027, subject to extensions as set forth therein.

     The Company may prepay loans and permanently reduce commitments under the Credit
Agreement at any time in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty (except
SOFR breakage costs, if applicable).

      In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the obligations as borrower under the
Former Credit Facility were prepaid and terminated.

      During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, the Company made no additional
borrowings or principal payments, resulting in total outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement of
$250.0 million as of October 2, 2022.

Covenants
      The Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants. The negative
covenants include, among other things, limitations on the Company’s ability to:
        • incur additional indebtedness;
        • grant additional liens;
        • enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
        • make loans or investments;
        • merge, consolidate or enter into acquisitions;
        • pay dividends or distributions;
        • enter into transactions with affiliates;
        • enter into new lines of business;

        • modify the terms of certain debt or other material agreements; and
        • change its fiscal year.

       Each of these covenants is subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions.

       In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain a
maximum total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00, which ratio may be increased from time to
time in connection with certain permitted acquisitions pursuant to conditions as set forth in the Credit
Agreement, and a minimum interest coverage ratio not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. Each of these
covenants is tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

      The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement as of
October 2, 2022.

5. Income Taxes
        The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 25.6% for the thirteen weeks ended October 2,
2022, compared to 23.0% for the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021.The increase in the effective tax
rate is primarily due to a decrease in enhanced charitable contributions due to the expiration of CARES
Act benefits as well as an increase of non-deductible executive compensation.
        The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 25.2% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2,
2022, compared to 24.1% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021.The increase in the effective
tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in enhanced charitable contributions due to the expiration of
CARES Act benefits as well as an increase of non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by
an increase in benefit from share-based payment awards in the current year. The income tax effect
resulting from excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards were $1.6 million and $0.2 million for
the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively.

         The Company files income tax returns for federal purposes and in many states. The Company’s
tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time,
generally three years, following the tax year to which those filings relate.

6. Related Party Transactions
       On May 24, 2022, the Company appointed a new member to its board of directors who is an
executive officer of a company that is a supplier of nutrition bars and related products to the Company for
resale. The cost of sales recognized from this supplier was $1.2 million during the thirteen weeks ended
October 2, 2022 and was $2.5 million since the beginning of the second quarter of 2022.

7. Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company is exposed to claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business
and uses various methods to resolve these matters that are believed to best serve the interests of the
Company’s stakeholders. The Company’s primary contingencies are associated with self-insurance
obligations and litigation matters. Self-insurance liabilities require significant judgment and actual claim
settlements and associated expenses may differ from the Company’s current provisions for loss.

Proposition 65 Coffee Action

       On April 13, 2010, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“CERT”)
filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against nearly 80
defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee, including the Company. CERT
alleged that the defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the
chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. CERT seeks
equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties.

      The Company, as part of a joint defense group, asserted multiple defenses against the lawsuit. On
May 7, 2018, the trial court issued a ruling adverse to defendants on these defenses to liability. On
October 1, 2019, before the court tried damages, remedies and attorneys' fees, California’s Office of
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment adopted a regulation that exempted “Exposures to listed
chemicals in coffee created by and inherent in the processes of roasting coffee beans or brewing coffee”
from Proposition 65’s warning requirement. On August 25, 2020, the court granted the defense motion for
summary judgment based on the regulation, and the case was dismissed.

      On November 20, 2020, CERT filed a notice of appeal to appeal the ruling on the defense motion
for summary judgment. On October 26, 2022, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision. As the
Company expects CERT to appeal this ruling, the Company is unable to predict or reasonably estimate
any potential loss or effect on the Company or its operations. Accordingly, no loss contingency was
recorded for this matter.

8. Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchases
        On March 2, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $600 million share
repurchase program for its common stock. The new authorization replaced the Company's then-existing
share repurchase authorization of $300 million that was due to expire on March 3, 2024, of which $99.8
million remained available upon its replacement. No further shares may be repurchased under the $300
million authorization. The following table outlines the common stock share repurchase programs
authorized by the Company’s board of directors and the related repurchase activity and available
authorization as of October 2, 2022.

        The shares under the Company’s repurchase programs may be purchased on a discretionary
basis from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market
conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The board’s authorization of
the share repurchase programs does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of
common stock, and the repurchase programs may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any
time.

      Share repurchase activity under the Company’s repurchase programs for the periods indicated
was as follows (total cost in thousands):

      Shares purchased under the Company’s repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the
excess of the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings.

       Subsequent to October 2, 2022 and through November 4, 2022, the Company repurchased an
additional 0.6 million shares of common stock for $17.8 million.

9. Net Income Per Share
        The computation of basic net income per share is based on the number of weighted average
shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share includes the
dilutive effect of share equivalents consisting of incremental shares deemed outstanding from the
assumed exercise of options, assumed vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and assumed vesting of
performance share awards (“PSAs”). PSAs are included in the computation of diluted net income per
share only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the
reporting period or would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related
performance period, and if the effect would be dilutive.

       A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share
calculations is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

yet deemed met. For the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021, the Company had 0.5 million options

10. Derivative Financial Instruments
        The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in December 2017 to manage its cash
flow associated with variable interest rates. This forward contract has been designated and qualifies as a
cash flow hedge, and its change in fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income
and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the forecasted transaction occurs.
The forward contract initially consisted of five cash flow hedges, of which one was outstanding at October
2, 2022. To qualify as a hedge, the Company needs to formally document, designate and assess the
effectiveness of the transactions that receive hedge accounting.

        The notional dollar amount of the one outstanding swap was $250.0 million at October 2, 2022 and
January 2, 2022, under which the Company pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate of interest
(cash flow swap). The cash flow swap hedges the change in interest rates on debt related to fluctuations
in interest rates and has a length of one year, maturing in 2022. This interest rate swap has been
designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge and has met the requirements to assume zero
ineffectiveness. The Company reviews the effectiveness of its hedging instruments on a quarterly basis.
During the first quarter of 2022, the Company elected to apply certain hedge accounting optional
expedients allowed under Topic 848. The expedients allow the Company to continue the method of
assessing effectiveness as documented in the original hedge documentation and allows the reference
rate on the hypothetical derivative to match the reference rate on the hedging instrument.

      The counterparties to these derivative financial instruments are major financial institutions. The
Company evaluates the credit ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an
acceptable level. The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments
designated as hedging instruments:

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
       You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations
together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2021 fiscal year, filed on February 24, 2022 (“Form 10-K”) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. All dollar amounts included below are in thousands, unless
otherwise noted.

                                            Business Overview
        Sprouts Farmers Market offers a unique grocery experience featuring an open layout with fresh
produce at the heart of the store. Sprouts inspires wellness naturally with a carefully curated assortment
of better-for-you products paired with purpose-driven people. We continue to bring the latest in
wholesome, innovative products made with lifestyle-friendly ingredients such as organic, plant-based and
gluten-free. Headquartered in Phoenix with 379 stores in 23 states as of October 2, 2022, we are one of
the largest and fastest growing specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States.

                                                Our Heritage
       In 2002, we opened the first Sprouts Farmers Market store in Chandler, Arizona. From our
founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability,
including successfully rebranding 43 Henry’s Farmers Market and 39 Sunflower Farmers Market stores
added in 2011 and 2012, respectively, through acquisitions to the Sprouts banner. These three
businesses all trace their lineage back to Henry’s Farmers Market and were built with similar store
formats and operations including a strong emphasis on value, produce and service in smaller, convenient
locations.

                                                   Outlook
     In 2020, we announced our new long-term growth strategy that we believe will transform our
company and drive profitable growth. We are executing on this strategy, focusing on the following areas:

    •    Win with Target Customers. We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified through
         research as 'health enthusiasts' and 'experience seekers', where there is ample opportunity to
         gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can continue to grow by
         leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you, quality products and by
         providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our website or the Sprouts
         app.

    •    Update Format and Expand in Select Markets. We are beginning to deliver unique smaller stores
         with expectations of stronger returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer’s
         market heritage Sprouts is known for. In 2021, we opened three stores and remodeled one store
         featuring our new format, and in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, we opened two
         new format stores. Our geographic store expansion and new store placement will intersect where
         our target customers live, in markets with growth potential and supply chain support, which we
         believe will provide a long runway of approximately 10% annual unit growth beginning in 2024.

    •    Create an Advantaged Fresh Supply Chain. We believe our network of fresh distribution centers
         can drive efficiencies across the chain and support growth plans. To further deliver on our fresh
         commitment and reputation, as well as to improve financial results, we aspire to ultimately

                                          Recent Developments
       Our operations have generally stabilized since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we
continue to experience varying levels of inflation through increased product costs which we continue to
pass through to retail pricing. In addition, due to continued difficulties in obtaining necessary equipment
from third parties and inflationary pressures due to supply chain delays complicated by the COVID-19
pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience increased costs and delays in our
planned new store openings. See “Risk Factors—The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted
our business and could negatively impact our financial condition.” in our Form 10-K for additional
information.

Comparable store sales growth                   2.4%                 (5.4)%

        Net sales during the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022 totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of
$81.4 million, or 5%, compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021. The sales increase was
driven by sales from new stores opened in the last twelve months and a 2.4% increase in comparable
store sales. The increase in comparable store sales was due in part to an increase in basket value due to
retail price inflation, partially offset by a slight reduction in the number of items per basket. Comparable
stores contributed approximately 97% of total sales for each of the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022
and October 3, 2021.

      Gross profit totaled $583.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022, an increase of
$43.9 million, or 8%, compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021, driven by increased sales
volume. Gross margin increased by 0.9% to 36.7% for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022,
compared to 35.8% for the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021, primarily as a result of offering fewer
promotions in the current year.

       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37.4 million, or 9%, compared to the
thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021.The increase is primarily due to new stores opened since the
comparable period in the prior year, higher wages and higher marketing spend in the current year, as well
as higher credit card and ecommerce fees.

$30.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022, compared to $30.4 million for the thirteen
weeks ended October 3, 2021. Depreciation and amortization primarily consists of depreciation and
amortization for buildings, store leasehold improvements, and equipment.

ended October 2, 2022 compared to $0.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021. The
increase in store closure and other costs, net was driven by inventory loss and other expenses incurred

      Interest expense, net decreased to $2.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022,
compared to $2.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021 primarily due to higher interest
income and lower credit facility fees. See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our
unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Income tax provision
        Income tax provision differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax
rate to pretax income as a result of the following:

                                                                             Thirteen weeks ended

       The effective tax rate increased to 25.6% for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2022 from
23.0% for the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily
due to an increase of non-deductible executive compensation as well as a decrease in enhanced
charitable contributions due to the expiration of CARES Act benefits.

       Net income increased $1.9 million primarily due to increased sales and gross profit, partially offset
by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate for the reasons
discussed above.

       The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.05 was driven by higher net income in addition to
fewer diluted shares outstanding compared to the prior year, due primarily to the share repurchase
program.

Comparable store sales growth                         2.0%                   (8.4)%

        Net sales during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 totaled $4.8 billion, an increase of
$220.6 million, or 5%, over the same period of the prior fiscal year. The sales increase was primarily due
to a 2.0% increase in comparable store sales, driven primarily by an increase in basket due to retail
inflation partially offset by a slight reduction of items in the basket, as well as sales from new stores
opened in the last twelve months. Comparable stores contributed approximately 97% of total sales for the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 and approximately 96% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October
3, 2021.

      Gross profit totaled $1.8 billion during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, an increase of
$99.8 million, or 6%, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021 driven by increased sales
volume. Gross margin increased to 36.8% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, compared to
36.4% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021, due to improved shrink and offering fewer
promotions in the current year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses

        Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $83.4 million, or 6%, compared to the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021.The increase was primarily driven by the net increase in new
stores opened since the prior year period as well as inflationary conditions driving increases in costs
including wages, utilities and supplies. In addition, we have seen higher credit card fees as more
consumers shift to credit compared to the prior year and ecommerce costs resulting from an increase in
ecommerce sales compared to the prior year.

for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021. Store closure and other costs, net during the thirty-nine
weeks ended October 2, 2022 primarily related to inventory loss and expenses incurred by several of our
stores impacted by Hurricane Ian in addition to costs associated with the closing of four stores year-to-
date. Store closure and other costs, net during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021 was driven
by inventory loss and additional expenses, net of insurance recovery, related to the impact of winter
storms at several of our stores and a fire at one of our stores during the thirty-nine weeks ended October

Income tax provision
        Income tax provision differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax
rate to pretax income as a result of the following:

                                                                              Thirty-nine weeks ended

        The effective tax rate increased to 25.2% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 from
24.1% in the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase of
non-deductible executive compensation as well as a decrease in enhanced charitable contributions due
to the expiration of CARES Act benefits, partially offset by an increase in benefit from share-based
payment awards in the current year.

       Net income increased $8.1 million primarily due to increased sales and gross profit, partially offset
by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate for the reasons
discussed above.

       The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.20 was driven by higher net income in addition to
fewer diluted shares outstanding compared to the prior year, due primarily to the share repurchase
program.

                                         Return on Invested Capital
        In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP, we provide information regarding Return on Invested Capital (referred to as “ROIC”)
as additional information about our operating results. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure and should
not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in
accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment
returns on capital and provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over
time.

        We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (referred to as “NOPAT”), including the effect of
capitalized operating leases, divided by average invested capital. Operating lease interest represents the
add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property
under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as a finance lease (capital lease prior to
adoption of ASC 842). The assumed ownership and associated interest expense are calculated using the
discount rate for each lease as recorded as a component of rent expense within selling, general and
administrative expenses. Invested capital reflects a trailing twelve-month average.

       As numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC, our method may differ from methods used by
other companies to calculate their ROIC. It is important to understand the methods and the differences in
those methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of
other companies.

        Our calculation of ROIC for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:

                                    Liquidity and Capital Resources
       The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth
below, as well as our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of each period (in thousands):

                                                                                  Thirty-nine weeks ended

Cash flows used in investing activities                                     $      (80,749) $         (70,010)

       We have generally financed our operations principally through cash generated from operations
and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory,
operating expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores, remodels and maintenance,
repurchases of our common stock and debt service. Our principal contractual obligations and
commitments consist of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement,
operating and finance leases, purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Our operating and
finance leases for the rental of land, buildings, and for rental of facilities and equipment expire or become
subject to renewal clauses at various dates through 2045. We believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash, and cash anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to
meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including new store openings, remodel and maintenance capital expenditures at
existing stores, store initiatives and other corporate capital expenditures and activities. Our cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to
customers the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within days from the related
sale.

Operating Activities
       Cash flows from operating activities increased $10.1 million to $306.8 million for the thirty-nine
weeks ended October 2, 2022 compared to $296.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3,
2021. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of cash generated from
higher net income and changes in working capital.

        Cash flows used in operating activities from changes in working capital were $6.9 million in the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 compared to $9.9 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October
3, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by the higher payout of COVID related incentive
compensation amounts earned in 2020 and paid in 2021, partially offset by higher inventories impacted
by inflationary cost increases on our purchases in the current year.

Investing Activities
         Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures in new stores,
including leasehold improvements and store equipment, capital expenditures to maintain the appearance
of our stores, sales enhancing initiatives and other corporate investments. Cash flows used in investing
activities were $80.7 million and $70.0 million, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022 and
October 3, 2021, respectively.


                                                     34
Table of Contents



       We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 - $135 million in 2022, including
expenditures incurred to date, net of estimated landlord tenant improvement allowances, primarily to fund
investments in new stores, remodels, maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital
expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from
operating activities.

Financing Activities
        Cash flows used in financing activities were $155.0 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October
2, 2022 compared to $136.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021. During the thirty-
nine weeks ended October 2, 2022, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of $155.1
million for stock repurchases and $3.4 million in debt issuance costs in connection with our Credit
Agreement, partially offset by $4.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

       During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2021, cash flows used in financing activities
primarily consisted of $137.5 million for stock repurchases.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities
       Long-term debt outstanding was $250.0 million as of October 2, 2022 and January 2, 2022.

       See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated
financial statements for a description of our new Credit Agreement and our Former Credit Facility (each
as defined therein).

Share Repurchase Program
       Our board of directors from time to time authorizes share repurchase programs for our common
stock. The following table outlines the share repurchase programs authorized by our board, and the
related repurchase activity and available authorization as of October 2, 2022.

                                                            Amount                 Cost of          Authorization

       The shares under our current repurchase program may be purchased on a discretionary basis
from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market
conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Our board’s authorization of
the share repurchase program does not obligate our Company to acquire any particular amount of
common stock, and the repurchase program may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any
time.

        Share repurchase activity under our repurchase program for the periods indicated was as follows

       Shares purchased under our repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the excess of
the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings.

        Subsequent to October 2, 2022 and through November 4, 2022, we repurchased an additional 0.6
million shares of common stock for $17.8 million.

Contractual Obligations
       Our principal contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business
consist of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and
finance leases, purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Except as otherwise disclosed in
Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated financial
statements, there have been no material changes outside the normal course of business as of October 2,
2022 in our contractual obligations and commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.
       The future amount and timing of interest payments are expected to vary with the outstanding
amounts and then prevailing contractual interest rates, net of interest rate swaps. Interest payments
through the March 25, 2027 maturity date of our Credit Agreement based on the outstanding amounts as
of October 2, 2022 and interest rates in effect at the time of this filing, are estimated to be approximately
$52.7 million, with $12.5 million payable within 12 months.

                                      Impact of Inflation and Deflation
        Inflation and deflation in the prices of food and other products we sell may periodically affect our
sales, gross profit and gross margin. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending,
could also reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. Inflationary pressures on
compensation, utilities, commodities, equipment and supplies may also impact our profitability. Food
deflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce, could reduce sales growth and earnings if our
competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and expanding their promotional activities, which can lead
to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and
comparable store sales. The short-term impact of inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether
or not the effects are passed through to our customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions.

        Food inflation and deflation is affected by a variety of factors and our determination of whether to
pass on the effects of inflation or deflation to our customers is made in conjunction with our overall pricing
and marketing strategies, as well as our competitors’ responses. Although we may experience periodic
effects on sales, gross profit, gross margins and cash flows as a result of changing prices, including
pressures we are currently experiencing due to product cost inflation which we are largely passing along
to retail pricing, we do not expect the effect of inflation or deflation to have a material impact on our ability
to execute our long-term business strategy.

                                       Critical Accounting Estimates

       Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses,
cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting estimates
include inventories, lease assumptions, self-insurance reserves, goodwill and intangible assets,
impairment of long-lived assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these
estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.

        There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during
the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2022. For a full discussion of these estimates and
policies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended January 2, 2022.

                              Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

       See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
        As described in Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Credit
Agreement bears interest at a rate based in part on SOFR. Accordingly, we could be exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates. Based solely on the $250.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit
Agreement as of October 2, 2022, each hundred basis point change in SOFR would result in a change in
interest expense by $2.5 million annually. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement in December
2017 to manage our cash flow associated with variable interest rates. The notional dollar amount of the
one outstanding swap at October 2, 2022 and January 2, 2022 was $250.0 million under which we pay a
fixed rate and received a variable rate of interest (cash flow swap). Taking into account the interest rate
swap, based on the $250.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement as of October 2,
2022, each hundred basis point change in SOFR would result in no change in interest expense annually.

       This sensitivity analysis assumes our mix of financial instruments and all other variables will
remain constant in future periods. These assumptions are made in order to facilitate the analysis and are
not necessarily indicative of our future intentions.

      We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes (see Note 10, “Derivative
Financial Instruments” of our unaudited consolidated financial statements).

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
        We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

       Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange
Act as of October 2, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
        During the quarterly period ended October 2, 2022, there were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

                                    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
       From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and
employment issues, product liability, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although
management does not expect that the outcome in these proceedings will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we
could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could materially impact our results.

      See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our unaudited consolidated financial
statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
         Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties referenced below, together with
all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial
statements and related notes. Any of those risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
operating results, financial condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline,
which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.

      There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described under “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.
