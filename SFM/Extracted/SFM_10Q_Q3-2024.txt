                                          Forward-Looking Statements

         This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial risks
and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(referred to as the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(referred to as the “Exchange Act”), including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs,
intentions, strategies, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected expenses, and plans
and objectives of management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,”
“could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “objective,” or the negative of these terms, and similar
expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements
contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events
and involve known risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity,
performance, or achievement to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and our other filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report.
Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

       As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to the
“Company,” “Sprouts,” “Sprouts Farmers Market,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.
and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
          The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied upon the transfer of goods to the customer, which
occurs at the point of sale, and payment from customers is also due at the time of sale. Proceeds from the sale
of gift cards are recorded as a liability at the time of sale and recognized as sales when they are redeemed by
the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Company. The Company’s gift cards do not
expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable percentage of gift cards will never be
redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to
actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period presented. A summary of the activity and
balances in the gift card liability, net is as follows:

                                                                                      Thirty-nine weeks ended

       The nature of goods the Company transfers to customers at the point of sale are inventories, consisting
of merchandise purchased for resale.

        The Company does not have any material contract assets or receivables from contracts with customers,
any revenue recognized in the current period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, any
contract performance obligations, or any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract as of September 29, 2024.


Restricted Cash
        Restricted cash relates to the Company's defined benefit plan forfeitures and the Company's
healthcare, general liability and workers’ compensation plan benefits of $2.1 million as of September 29, 2024
and December 31, 2023. These balances are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
consolidated balance sheets.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

         In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU no. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements
to Reportable Segment Disclosures." The amendments in this update increase required disclosures about a
public entity's reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses
that are regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU
2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM. The guidance will be effective
beginning with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year 2024 and for interim periods
starting in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending December 28, 2025 ("fiscal year 2025"). Early adoption is
permitted, and the guidance is required to be applied retrospectively. The Company expects this update to
impact its segment disclosures but does not anticipate that this update will impact its results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition.

Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

         In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU no. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures." The amendments in this update enhance a public entity's annual income tax
disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The guidance will be
effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance should be
applied prospectively, with an option to apply it retrospectively. The Company expects this update to impact its
income tax disclosures but does not anticipate that this update will impact its results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition.

       No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the thirteen weeks ended
September 29, 2024 had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.


3. Fair Value Measurements
         The Company records its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with GAAP. This framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value:

         Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

         Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

         Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable.

       Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in the
impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets.

      The Company did not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
September 29, 2024. The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023:

                    December 31, 2023                    Level 1         Level 2          Level 3          Total
    Long-term debt                                   $             — $     125,000 $                — $    125,000
      Total financial liabilities                    $             — $     125,000 $                — $    125,000

        The determination of fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets for purposes of the Company’s
goodwill or long-lived asset impairment evaluation is based upon Level 3 inputs. When necessary, the Company
uses third party market data and market participant assumptions to derive the fair value of its asset groupings,
which primarily include right-of-use lease assets and property and equipment.

         Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued salaries and benefits approximate fair value because
of the short maturity of those instruments. Based on comparable open market transactions, the fair value of the
long-term debt approximated carrying value as of December 31, 2023.

Credit Agreement
         The Company’s subsidiary, Sprouts Farmers Markets Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate Holdings”), is the
borrower under a credit agreement entered into on March 25, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit
Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with an initial aggregate
commitment of $700.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be increased from time to
time in accordance with an expansion feature set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         The Company capitalized debt issuance costs of $3.4 million related to the Credit Agreement, which,
combined with the remaining $0.5 million debt issuance costs in respect of that certain amended and restated
credit agreement entered into on March 27, 2018, by and among the Company, Intermediate Holdings, certain
lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (the
“Former Credit Facility”), which remained outstanding as of the time of Intermediate Holdings’ entry into the
Credit Agreement, were recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the five-
year term of the Credit Agreement.

         The Credit Agreement provides for a $70.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (the "Letter of Credit Sub-
Facility") and a $50.0 million swingline facility. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce the
capacity of Intermediate Holdings to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of credit totaling $19.6
million have been issued as of September 29, 2024 under the Letter of Credit Sub-Facility, primarily to support
the Company’s insurance programs.


Guarantees
         Obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and substantially all of its
existing and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by first-priority security
interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company, Intermediate Holdings, and the subsidiary guarantors,
including, without limitation, a pledge by the Company of its equity interest in Intermediate Holdings.


Interest and Fees
         Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, either at the Term
SOFR (with a floor of 0.00%) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 1.00% per annum or base rate (with a floor of
0.00%) plus 0.00% per annum. The interest rate margins are subject to upward adjustments pursuant to a
pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio as set forth in the Credit Agreement and to upward
or downward adjustments of up to 0.05% based upon the achievement of certain diversity and sustainability-
linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the
available unused amount of the commitments, which commitment fee ranges between 0.10% to 0.225% per
annum, pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The commitment fees are
subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.01% based upon the achievement of certain diversity
and sustainability-linked metric thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         As of September 29, 2024, loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement bore interest at Term SOFR
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment and 0.95% per annum. The Company had
no loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 29, 2024.

         As of September 29, 2024, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement were subject
to a participation fee of 0.95% per annum and an issuance fee of 0.125% per annum.


Payments and Borrowings
       The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate on
March 25, 2027, subject to extensions as set forth therein.

          The Company may prepay loans and permanently reduce commitments under the Credit Agreement at
any time in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty (except SOFR breakage
costs, if applicable).

        In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company's obligations under the Former
Credit Facility were prepaid and terminated.

         During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, the Company made no additional
borrowings and made principal payments of $125.0 million, resulting in no outstanding debt under the Credit
Agreement as of September 29, 2024. During 2023, the Company made no additional borrowings and made
principal payments of $125.0 million, resulting in total outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement of $125.0

         In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain a maximum
total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00, which ratio may be increased from time to time in connection
with certain permitted acquisitions pursuant to conditions as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and a minimum
interest coverage ratio not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. Each of these covenants is tested as of the last day of
each fiscal quarter.

      The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement as of
September 29, 2024.


5. Income Taxes
         The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 25.8% for the thirteen weeks ended September 29,
2024, compared to 24.0% for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate
was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible executive compensation, an unfavorable current year return-
to-provision true-up compared to the favorable prior year period true-up, and the increase in pre-tax income
outpacing the increase to the benefit from enhanced inventory donations deductions. The income tax effect
resulting from excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards was $1.7 million and $1.1 million for the
thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

        The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 24.5% for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29,
2024, compared to 24.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate
was primarily due to an unfavorable current year return-to-provision true-up compared to the favorable prior
year period true-up, a prior period refund of interest from amended returns, and the increase in pre-tax income
outpacing the increase to the benefit from enhanced inventory donations deductions, partially offset by an
increase in excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment awards. The income tax effect resulting
from excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards was $6.8 million and $4.2 million for the thirty-nine
weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

          The Company files income tax returns for federal purposes and in many states. The Company’s tax
filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time, generally three
years, following the tax year to which those filings relate.


6. Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company is exposed to claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business and
uses various methods to resolve these matters that are believed to best serve the interests of the Company’s
stakeholders. The Company’s primary contingencies are associated with self-insurance obligations and litigation
matters. Self-insurance liabilities require significant judgment and actual claim settlements and associated
expenses may differ from the Company’s current provisions for loss.


7. Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchases
         On May 22, 2024, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $600 million share repurchase
program for its common stock. This authorization replaced the Company's then-existing share repurchase
authorization of $600 million that was due to expire on December 31, 2024, of which $119.3 million remained
available upon its replacement, and under which no further shares may be repurchased. The following table
outlines the common stock share repurchase programs authorized by the Company’s board of directors and the
related repurchase activity and available authorization as of September 29, 2024:

         The shares under the Company’s repurchase programs may be purchased on a discretionary basis
from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market conditions and
other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other
means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The board’s authorization of the share repurchase
programs does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the
repurchase programs may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

         Share repurchase activity under the Company’s repurchase programs for the periods indicated was as
follows (total cost in thousands):

       Shares purchased under the Company’s repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the
excess of the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares
repurchased included the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

        Subsequent to September 29, 2024 and through the date of this filing, the Company repurchased an
additional 0.1 million shares of common stock for $5.6 million, excluding excise tax.


8. Net Income Per Share
         The computation of basic net income per share is based on the number of weighted average shares
outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share includes the dilutive effect of
share equivalents consisting of incremental shares deemed outstanding from the assumed exercise of options
and unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Performance share awards ("PSAs") are included in the
computation of diluted net income per share only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are
satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the
end of the related performance period, and if the effect would be dilutive.

were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as those awards would have been
antidilutive or were performance awards with performance conditions not yet deemed met.

         For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, the Company had 0.1 million options and

deemed met.


9. Segments
          The Company has one operating segment and, therefore, one reportable segment: healthy grocery
stores.

         The Company categorizes the varieties of products it sells as perishable and non-perishable.
Perishable product categories include produce, meat and meat alternatives, seafood, deli, bakery, floral and
dairy and dairy alternatives. Non-perishable product categories include grocery, vitamins and supplements, bulk
items, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care.

2022 Incentive Plan
         In March 2022, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. 2022
Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2022 Incentive Plan”), which became effective May 25, 2022, upon
approval by the Company’s stockholders. The 2022 Incentive Plan provides team members of the Company,
certain consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company, and non-employee members of the
Company's board of directors with the opportunity to receive grants of equity awards, including stock options,
RSUs, PSAs, and other stock-based awards. The 2022 Incentive Plan replaced the 2013 Incentive Plan (as
described below).

         The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued to team members and directors
under the 2022 Incentive Plan may not exceed 6,600,000, subject to the following adjustments. If any awards
granted under the 2022 Incentive Plan, terminate, expire, or are cancelled, forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered
without having been exercised, vested or paid in shares, the shares will again be available for purposes of the
2022 Incentive Plan. The number of shares subject to outstanding awards under the Sprouts Farmers Market,
Inc. 2013 Incentive Plan (the “2013 Incentive Plan”) that terminate, expire, are paid in cash, or are cancelled,
forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered without having been exercised, vested, or paid in shares under the 2013
Incentive Plan after the effective date of the 2022 Incentive Plan will be available for issuance under the 2022
Incentive Plan. As of September 29, 2024, there were 1,071,109 stock awards outstanding and 5,585,223
shares remaining available for issuance under the 2022 Incentive Plan.

2013 Incentive Plan
        Prior to the adoption of the 2022 Incentive Plan, the 2013 Incentive Plan served as the umbrella plan for
the Company’s share-based and cash-based incentive compensation programs for its directors, officers and
other team members. Upon stockholder approval of the 2022 Incentive Plan on May 25, 2022, no further
awards will be granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan, but awards outstanding under the 2013 Incentive Plan
will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and the terms of the 2013 Incentive Plan.


Stock Options
        The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options at grant
date. Options vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the grant letter.

         Time-based options vest annually over a period of three years.


RSUs
      The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.
RSUs generally vest annually over a period of two or three years from the grant date.


PSAs
         PSAs granted in 2020 were subject to the Company achieving certain earnings before taxes (“EBT”)
performance targets for the 2022 fiscal year. The criteria was based on a range of performance targets in which
grantees may earn 0% to 200% of the base number of awards granted. The performance conditions with
respect to fiscal year 2022 EBT were deemed to have been met, and the PSAs vested at the maximum pay out
level on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 2023). There were no outstanding 2020 PSAs as of
September 29, 2024.

         PSAs granted in 2021 were subject to the Company achieving certain earnings before interest and
taxes ("EBIT") performance targets for the 2023 fiscal year. The criteria was based on a range of performance
targets in which grantees may earn 0% to 200% of the base number of awards granted. The performance

Market and Sunflower Farmers Market in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and the acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc.
in 2023. For further details, see Note 13, "Business Combination".

12. Store Closures
         In February 2023, the Company's board of directors approved the closing of 11 stores, all of which were
closed during 2023. These stores, on average, were approximately 30% larger than the Company's current
prototype format and were underperforming financially. The closure of these stores resulted in a charge of $27.8
million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 related to the impairment of leasehold improvements
and right-of-use assets and was reflected in Store closure and other costs, net on the consolidated statements
of income. The impairment charge represented the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of
each store's asset group. Accelerated depreciation on the closed stores' assets during 2023 was $5.9 million,
and was reflected in Depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of income. Severance
expense during 2023 was immaterial.


13. Business Combination
       On March 20, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc., a corporation that
owned two stores located in California operating under the ‘Sprouts Farmers Market’ name pursuant to a legacy
trademark license arrangement. The aggregate consideration paid in the transaction consisted of 0.6 million of
the Company’s common shares valued at $18.1 million using the closing price of the Company's common stock
on March 20, 2023 and cash consideration of $13.0 million.

           The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with the
acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the assets and
liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs were
immaterial and were expensed as incurred. The financial results of the acquired stores have been included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquired stores' results of
operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results.

         The net purchase price was allocated to the net tangible assets of ($4.9) million and a reacquired right
intangible asset of $23.1 million based on their fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated
net purchase price of $12.9 million was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits
to the Company from the acquisition, which include the Company's ability to fully control the Sprouts Farmers
Market brand by termination of the legacy trademark license agreement and allowing further expansion
opportunities in Southern California. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The final
allocation of the purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been
completed and included an immaterial amount of measurement period adjustments.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
         You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together
with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the 2023 fiscal year, filed on February 22, 2024 (“Form 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. All dollar amounts included below are in thousands, unless otherwise noted.


                                                  Business Overview
         Sprouts Farmers Market offers a unique specialty grocery experience featuring an open layout with
fresh produce at the heart of the store. Sprouts inspires wellness naturally with a carefully curated assortment of
better-for-you products paired with purpose-driven people. We continue to bring the latest in wholesome,
innovative products made with lifestyle-friendly ingredients such as organic, plant-based and gluten-free. From
our founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability.
Headquartered in Phoenix with 428 stores in 23 states as of September 29, 2024, we are one of the largest and
fastest growing specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States.


                                                  Our Growth Strategy
        We continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy that we believe is transforming our company
and driving profitable growth, focusing on the following areas:
         •          Win with Target Customers. We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified
                    through research as ‘health enthusiasts’ and ‘selective shoppers’, where there is ample
                    opportunity to gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can
                    continue to grow by leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you,
                    quality products and by providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our
                    website or the Sprouts app.
         •          Update Format and Expand in Select Markets. We are delivering unique smaller stores with
                    expectations of stronger returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer’s
                    market heritage Sprouts is known for. From 2021 through September 29, 2024, we opened 63
                    new stores and remodeled one store featuring our new format. Our geographic store expansion
                    and new store placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth
                    potential and supply chain support, which we believe will provide a long runway of
                    approximately 10% annual unit growth.
         •          Create an Advantaged Fresh Supply Chain. We believe our network of fresh distribution
                    centers can drive efficiencies across the chain and support our growth plans. To further deliver
                    on our fresh commitment and reputation, as well as to increase our local offerings and improve
                    financial results, we aspire to ultimately position fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile
                    radius of stores. Following the opening of two fresh distribution centers in fiscal 2021 and the
                    relocation of our Southern California distribution center, closure of our Georgia distribution
                    center and partnership with a third-party fresh distribution center in the Northeast in fiscal 2023,
                    we are better leveraging our existing distribution center capacity, and approximately 80% of our
                    stores were within 250 miles of a distribution center as of September 29, 2024.
         •          Refine Brand and Marketing Approach. We believe we are elevating our national brand
                    recognition and positioning by telling our unique brand story rooted in product innovation and
                    differentiation. We are increasing our use of data analytics and insights. We believe this data-
                    driven intelligence will increase customer engagement through personalization efforts with
                    digital and social connections to drive additional sales growth and loyalty.
         •          Inspire and Engage Our Talent to Create a Best Place to Work. Subsequent to the initial launch
                    of our long-term growth strategy, we have added the focus area of inspiring and engaging our
                    talent through our culture, acquisition and development and total rewards program to attract
                    and retain the talent we believe we need to execute on our strategic goals and transform our
                    company into a premier place to work.

         •          Deliver on Financial Targets and Box Economics. We are measuring and reporting on the
                    success of this strategy against a number of long-term financial and operational targets. With
                    the implementation of our strategy beginning in 2020, we have significantly improved our
                    margin structure above our 2019 baseline.

       Gross profit totaled $740.9 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of
$115.5 million or 18%, compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023, driven by increased sales
volume. Gross margin increased by 1.6% to 38.1% for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024,
compared to 36.5% for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023, primarily driven by improved inventory
management and robust sales.


Selling, general and administrative expenses

                                                        Thirteen weeks ended
                                                   September 29,

        Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $77.5 million or 15%, compared to the thirteen
weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new stores opened since the
comparable period last year. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased slightly as a result of higher incentive compensation costs and ecommerce fees due to strong sales
performance and higher professional fees and other costs incurred related to strategic initiatives.

million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to $31.8 million for the thirteen weeks
ended October 1, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of depreciation and
amortization for buildings, store leasehold improvements, and equipment for new stores as well as remodel
initiatives in older stores.

         Store closure and other costs, net for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 of $3.7 million and
for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023 of $3.2 million was primarily related to ongoing occupancy costs
associated with our closed store locations. See Note 12, “Store Closures” of our unaudited consolidated
financial statements.

          The decrease in interest (income) expense, net for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024
compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023 was primarily due to lower average debt outstanding
and higher interest income driven by higher interest rates. See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease
Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Income tax provision
        Income tax provision differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate
to pretax income as a result of the following:

                                                                                           Thirteen weeks ended

Effective tax rate                                                                          25.8 %                 24.0 %

         The effective tax rate increased to 25.8% for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 from 24.0%
for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an
increase in non-deductible executive compensation, an unfavorable current year return-to-provision true-up
compared to the favorable prior year period true-up, and the increase in pre-tax income outpacing the increase
to the benefit from enhanced inventory donations deductions.


Net income

        Net income increased $26.3 million primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling,
general and administrative expenses for the reasons discussed above.


Diluted earnings per share

        The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.27 was driven by higher net income and fewer diluted
shares outstanding compared to the prior year, due primarily to the share repurchase program.

        Net sales during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 totaled $5.7 billion, an increase of
$584.2 million, or 11%, over the same period of the prior fiscal year. The sales increase was primarily due to
new stores opened in the last twelve months and a 6.4% increase in comparable store sales. Comparable
stores contributed approximately 94% of total sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and
approximately 96% of total sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023.

       Gross profit totaled $2.2 billion during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of
$280.1 million, or 15%, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, driven by increased sales
volume. Gross margin increased to 38.1% for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to
37.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, due to improved inventory management and continued
promotional optimization efforts as well as leverage on our supply chain from higher sales.

          Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $189.5 million, or 13%, compared to the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in new stores
opened since the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased due to higher incentive compensation costs and ecommerce fees driven by strong sales performance
and higher professional fees and other costs incurred related to strategic initiatives.

         The effective tax rate increased to 24.5% for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 from
24.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due
to an unfavorable current year return-to-provision true-up compared to the favorable prior year period true-up, a
prior period refund of interest from amended returns, and the increase in pre-tax income outpacing the increase
to the benefit from enhanced inventory donations deductions, partially offset by an increase in excess tax
benefits associated with share-based payment awards.

        Net income increased $92.2 million primarily due to higher gross profit and lower store closure and
other costs, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses for the reasons discussed
above.

        The increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.96 was driven by higher net income and fewer diluted
shares outstanding compared to the prior year due primarily to the share repurchase program.


                                          Return on Invested Capital
         In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP, we provide information regarding Return on Invested Capital (referred to as “ROIC”) as additional
information about our operating results. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be reviewed in
isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an
important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital and provides a
meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time.

         We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (referred to as “NOPAT”), including the effect of
capitalized operating leases, divided by average invested capital. Operating lease interest represents the add-
back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our
operating leases were owned or accounted for as a finance lease. The assumed ownership and associated
interest expense are calculated using the discount rate for each lease as recorded as a component of rent
expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Invested capital reflects a trailing four-quarter
average.

       As numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC, our method may differ from methods used by other
companies to calculate their ROIC. It is important to understand the methods and the differences in those
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of other
companies.

         We have generally financed our operations principally through cash generated from operations and
borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory, operating
expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores, remodels and maintenance, repurchases of
our common stock and debt service. Our principal contractual obligations and commitments consist of
obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases,
purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Our operating and finance leases for the rental of land,
buildings, and for rental of facilities and equipment expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various
dates through 2048. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and cash
anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the
next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including new store openings,
remodel and maintenance capital expenditures at existing stores, store initiatives and other corporate capital
expenditures and activities. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash position benefits from the fact that
we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card
transactions, within days from the related sale.

Operating Activities
        Cash flows from operating activities increased $111.4 million to $520.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 29, 2024 compared to $409.0 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The
increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash
items of $91.6 million and favorable changes in working capital of $43.4 million, partially offset by higher
payments on our operating lease liabilities of $18.9 million due to growth.

          Cash flows provided by operating activities from changes in working capital were $114.2 million in the
thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to $70.8 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 1, 2023. This $43.4 million increase in cash flows from changes in working capital was primarily
attributable to a $20.2 million change in accounts receivable driven by the timing of collections as well as $17.0
million change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily due to timing differences of payments for
goods and services. Certain other immaterial items combined to result in an additional $6.2 million net increase
in cash flows from changes in working capital.

Investing Activities
          Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures in new stores, including
leasehold improvements and store equipment, capital expenditures to maintain the appearance of our stores,
sales enhancing initiatives and other corporate investments as well as cash outlays for acquisitions. Cash flows
used in investing activities were $161.7 million and $178.0 million, for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 29, 2024 and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Cash flows used in investing
activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 included our acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc. See
Note 13, "Business Combination" of our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

         We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $205 - 215 million in 2024, including expenditures
incurred to date, net of estimated landlord tenant improvement allowances, primarily to fund investments in new
stores, remodels, maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures. We expect to fund our
capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from operating activities.


Financing Activities

          Cash flows used in financing activities were $250.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 29, 2024 compared to $272.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. During the
thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of
$125.0 million in payments on our Credit Agreement and $129.7 million for stock repurchases, partially offset by
$4.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

          During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, cash flows used in financing activities primarily
consisted of $180.4 million for stock repurchases and $100.0 million in payments on our Credit Agreement,
partially offset by $8.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities
        The Company had no long-term debt outstanding as of September 29, 2024. Long-term debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2023 was $125.0 million.

       See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated financial

Share Repurchase Program
         Our board of directors from time to time authorizes share repurchase programs for our common stock.
The following table outlines the share repurchase program authorized by our board, and the related repurchase
activity and available authorization as of September 29, 2024:

         The shares under our current repurchase program may be purchased on a discretionary basis from
time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market conditions and other
investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means,
including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Our board’s authorization of the share repurchase program does
not obligate our Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may
be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

         Share repurchase activity under our repurchase program for the periods indicated was as follows (total
cost in thousands):

        Shares purchased under our repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the excess of the
repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares repurchased
included the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

         Subsequent to September 29, 2024 and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an additional
0.1 million shares of common stock for $5.6 million, excluding excise tax.


Contractual Obligations
         Our principal contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business consist
of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases,
purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Except as otherwise disclosed in Note 4, “Long-Term Debt
and Finance Lease Liabilities” of our unaudited consolidated financial statements, there have been no material
changes outside the normal course of business as of September 29, 2024 in our contractual obligations and
commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023.

                                        Impact of Inflation and Deflation
          Inflation and deflation in the prices of food and other products we sell may periodically affect our sales,
gross profit and gross margin. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending, could also
reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. Inflationary pressures on compensation, utilities,
commodities, equipment and supplies may also impact our profitability. Food deflation or declining levels of
inflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce, could reduce sales growth and earnings, particularly
if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and expanding their promotional activities, which can lead
to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and comparable
store sales. The short-term impact of inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether or not the effects
are passed through to our customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions.

          Food inflation and deflation is affected by a variety of factors and our determination of whether to pass
on the effects of inflation or deflation to our customers is made in conjunction with our overall pricing and
marketing strategies, as well as our competitors’ responses. Although we may experience periodic effects on
sales, gross profit, gross margins and cash flows as a result of changing prices, we do not expect the effect of
inflation or deflation to have a material impact on our ability to execute our long-term business strategy.


                                         Critical Accounting Estimates
         Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, cash flow
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting estimates include inventories,
lease assumptions, self-insurance reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets,
and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial
statements will be affected.

         There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during the
thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. For a full discussion of these estimates and policies,
see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023.


                                Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
         See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
         As described in Note 4, “Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities” to our unaudited consolidated
financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Credit Agreement bears
interest at a rate based in part on SOFR. Accordingly, we could be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. As
of September 29, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement.


Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
         We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal
executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of
September 29, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
         During the quarterly period ended September 29, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

                                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
         From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and
employment issues, product liability, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although management does
not expect that the outcome in these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we could incur judgments or enter into
settlements of claims that could materially impact our results.


Item 1A. Risk Factors.
         Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties referenced below, together with all of the
other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and
related notes. Any of those risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial
condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline, which could cause you to lose all
or part of your investment.

        There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described under “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
