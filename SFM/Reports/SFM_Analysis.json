    "Differentiated positioning captures share: Winning against conventional grocers with superior natural/organic assortment while being more affordable than Whole Foods. 8.1% foot traffic growth in Q3 2024 demonstrates market share gains",
    "Significant expansion runway: 10% annual unit growth target (35+ stores in 2025) with new smaller format driving higher returns. Florida and East Coast markets underpenetrated. 440 stores today vs 1,900+ for Whole Foods and 2,700+ for Trader Joe's suggests long growth runway",

Loyalty program must deliver on customer data and personalization. 35+ new stores annually requires flawless site selection and execution. Florida expansion into competitive market with Publix dominance",
