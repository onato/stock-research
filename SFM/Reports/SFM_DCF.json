    "key_drivers": "Valuation highly sensitive to terminal growth rate and FCF margin assumptions. Company's ability to sustain high growth rate (10%+ revenue growth) and expand FCF margins from current 5.4% to 6%+ will be critical. Historical volatility in FCF (ranged from $54M in FY2014 to $415M in FY2024) creates uncertainty.",
    "risks_to_valuation": "Downside risks include recession-driven trade-down to conventional grocers, competitive margin pressure, new store execution failures, loyalty program disappointment, self-distribution transition issues, and California exposure to climate/economic shocks. FCF margin compression to 4.5% or lower in bear case would significantly impair value.",
    "upside_to_valuation": "Upside case requires loyalty program to successfully drive customer data capture from 11% to 80%+, self-distribution to replicate produce margin success in meat/seafood, continued market share gains from conventional grocers, and operating leverage from scale. FCF margin expansion to 6-7% could support higher valuations.",
    "recommendation": "Current price of $165 implies high expectations already embedded. Conservative investors should wait for better entry point. Base case suggests fair value around $79, implying 52% downside risk. Entry price for 15% annual returns would be $46 (72% below current). Only compelling if bull case plays out with high confidence."
