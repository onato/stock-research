Wise plc
Q3 FY23 Trading Update
17 January 2023

Continued progress towards our mission with more
customers than ever using Wise; improved guidance for FY23
We continue to deliver on our mission to solve a massive problem in a large
underserved market and more customers than ever are using Wise. In Q3 FY23, 5.8
million customers moved 28% more volume with us (£26.4 billion) compared with Q3
FY22.
We continue to invest in building the infrastructure that powers our products. For the
third consecutive quarter, more than 50% of our payments were completed instantly. We
remain focused on lowering cross-border fees over the long term and, although the
average customer price increased by 2bps in the quarter, we continue to offer significantly
lower rates than those offered by the banks from which our customers join.
Our teams are making the products that people and businesses love even more
convenient, which is leading to greater adoption of the Wise Account. Notably in Q3 FY23
we launched new initiatives so that our customers can benefit from the higher interest
rate environment, and we made it easier for businesses to spend and get paid.
We are highly profitable and cash generative even after we invest significantly in our
products and infrastructure for future growth.
As a result of continued revenue growth this quarter, supported by higher interest income
in recent months, we are upgrading our FY23 total income growth guidance to 68-72%,
from 55-60% previously.
Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder said:
“Our mission is clear - to make moving and managing money faster, easier, cheaper and
more transparent for people and businesses around the world.
As interest rates increase, our customers expect a return on the balances they hold with
us, and we intend to share much of the benefit of higher rates with customers. This
quarter we launched ‘Interest’ within our Assets product in the UK; a whole new way for
our customers to hold their money and earn a return. I’m also pleased that for the third
consecutive quarter, more than 50% of cross-border payments were completed instantly.
The investments we’ve made to deliver a superior infrastructure and product are
resonating, and in this quarter more customers than ever used Wise. This underpins our
conviction in the outlook for 2023 and beyond.”

Customer price is based on a fixed basket of representative currencies which reduces the effect from route mix and
other factors, making it a more accurate representation of our progress in reducing the cost of international transfers
over time.

We focus on four pillars in pursuit of our mission: price, speed, convenience and
transparency.
Core to our mission is sustainably lowering prices for customers over time. To do this,
changes in the average customer price reflect the changes in the cost to deliver
payments. But during this quarter the average price increased to 0.66% compared to
0.64% in Q2 FY23 and 0.60% in Q3 FY22, as previously announced price changes, which
were a result of higher FX costs, came into effect. We were, however, able to lower fees for
some currency routes, including a 50% price reduction for sending money to Mexico and a
10% reduction for sending and converting Brazilian Reais.
Speed is fundamental to the excellent customer experience that we aim to deliver, and for
the third consecutive quarter more than 50% of our cross-border payments were
completed instantly. In fact, over 90% were completed within 24 hours. We saw
improvements in speed in a number of countries, including Mexico, Brazil and the US.
We’ve continued to make it more convenient for our customers to move and manage
money internationally. In the quarter, we:
●

launched ‘Interest’ within our Assets product for UK customers;

●

launched a pilot programme in the UK for business customers to earn 1% cashback
on Wise debit card transactions;

●

launched a pilot programme in the EEA for cashback on balances;

●

removed fees on domestic transfers in EUR, GBP, SGD and HUF;

●

rolled out physical cards for businesses in the US, previously only digital cards were
available;

●

improved pay-ins for businesses – where they can now get paid directly through
Wise by sharing 'payment request' links and can now pay requested links directly
from a Wise balance; and

●

expanded our Platform partnerships, welcoming AvidXchange, ZA Bank and Wio.

including our mission roadmap, which sets out future product improvements we have
planned.

5.8 million customers transacted with Wise in Q3 FY23, an increase of 33% YoY and 6%
QoQ, comprising 5.5 million personal (+34% YoY) and 320K business customers (+26% YoY).
This increase in active customers continues to be driven by strong new customer growth.
Total cross border volumes were £26.4 billion in Q3 FY23, 28% higher than in the same
period last year. Personal customers moved £19.0 billion, a 26% increase compared with
last year, reflecting the continued strong growth in active customers. Business volumes of
£7.4 billion were 35% higher YoY as we see businesses growing in size and transacting
more often with us, leading to a higher VPC. On a constant currency basis1 , total volumes
grew 23% YoY.
Compared with Q2 FY23, total volumes were 2% lower. Whilst VPC for business customers
continued to increase QoQ, personal VPC was down 10%, primarily due to lower levels of
activity in the high-volume cohorts of personal customers. This is consistent with the
pull-forward we saw in Q1 and Q2 FY23 among these cohorts, which we believe was
supported by higher FX volatility and strength in the USD. Volume among the more
populous, smaller-volume cohort (<£10k), continued to grow QoQ.
Revenue for Q3 FY23 was £225.2 million, up 50% YoY and 6% QoQ. Our take rate increased
7 bps QoQ to 0.85% from 0.78% driven by a higher cross-currency take rate, which reflects
the full impact of previously announced price increases coming into effect in the quarter,
and a change in the overall mix of routes used by customers in the period. Revenue was
also supported by higher other revenues, which has benefited from greater adoption of
the Wise Account, notably in the form of higher debit card spend and interchange fees.
Total income, inclusive of net interest income, for Q3 FY23 was £268.7 million, an 80%
increase on last year and the total income take rate increased 30 bps to 1.02%. Net interest
income of £43.5 million was 148% higher than in Q2 FY23 due to higher rates on invested

assets and continued growth in customer balances. We’ve made good progress in
beginning to share this benefit with customers, but there is still work to do to scale up
these initiatives in all of our regions, and so until these are fully operational we expect a
higher proportion of this net interest income to flow to EBITDA in the short-term.
As a result of the continued growth in revenue this quarter, supported by the increase in
net interest income, we are upgrading our FY23 total income guidance and now expect
this to grow 68-72%, compared with 55-60% previously. With a higher proportion of the
net interest income to flow to EBITDA in the short-term, we expect our adjusted EBITDA
margin for the second half of FY23 to be higher than the 22% in the first half of FY23.
Our medium-term guidance for total income and adjusted EBITDA margin remains
unchanged.
Summary of forward looking guidance:
●

Total income growth expected to be between 68-72% in FY23 and greater than
20% (CAGR) over the medium-term;

●

Adjusted EBITDA margin for H2 FY23 expected to be higher than the 22% margin
in H1 FY23; and

●

Adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20% over the medium-term.

Intention to reduce dilution from stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation forms a core component of how we reward and incentivise
Wisers, aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. We have historically issued
new shares to satisfy stock-based compensation and this is likely to continue in the near
to medium-term.
Wise is profitable and highly cash generative, whilst also making significant investment
into future growth. As at 31 December 2022, we had £315 million of eligible group capital,
which remains significantly in excess of our regulatory capital requirements.
Given our strong capital position we plan to reduce the impact of dilution from
stock-based compensation. The intention is for the Employee Benefit Trust to acquire up
to an initial £10 million of Wise shares in the market for this purpose over the remainder of
FY23. We will continue to assess our plans beyond FY23.
