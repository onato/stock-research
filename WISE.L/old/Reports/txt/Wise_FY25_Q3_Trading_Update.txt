Q3 FY25 Trading Update
16 January 2025

24% volume growth YoY driven by 9m active customers
●​ We are making significant strides toward our long-term goal of becoming the network for
the world's money as over 9m customers used Wise in Q3 to move or manage their money
globally representing 20% growth YoY.
●​ With more customers using Wise, cross border volumes grew 24% (27% on a constant
currency basis) to £37.8bn and Wise account balances grew by 26% to £16.2bn.
●​ Continued adoption of the Wise account resulted in a 39% YoY increase in card and other
revenue.
●​ Our discipline and focus in reducing unit costs allowed us to lower prices in the first half of
FY25, which was the main driver of the cross border take rate reducing by 11bps YoY to
56bps in Q3.
●​ Underlying income grew by 13% YoY to £349.5m in Q3, bringing YTD growth to 17% YoY on
a reported basis. Changes in FX rates result in an understatement of our growth, with
underlying income having grown by 20% on a constant currency basis.
●​ On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect underlying income growth of 15-20%
in FY25, with the reported growth expected to be at the lower end of this range as a result
of the FX headwind.
“This quarter saw us take another step closer to achieving our mission, most notably through
extending the availability of Wise to even more customers.
Having seen rapid customer growth from the popularity of the Wise Account for individuals in Brazil,
we were pleased to also launch our service for micro-businesses based in Brazil during the quarter.
This comes as we work towards integrating with Brazil’s payment system (PIX) which will further
enhance the quality of our proposition in the country.
Wise Platform continues to bring the power of the Wise infrastructure directly to our partners and
their customers. We were delighted to announce that Morgan Stanley is now using Wise for
international settlements capabilities for its corporate customers. Additionally, we announced that
Wise will soon power faster and cheaper international payments for Standard Chartered’s
cross-border payment service, SC Remit. These partnerships provide even more people and
businesses with easy access to a service that continues to become faster and lower cost. Given their
scale, entering into relationships with such leading global institutions represents important milestones
in our journey as we move closer towards achieving money without borders.”
