Q4 FY23 Trading Update
18 April 2023

Wise Account drives 33% customer growth YoY for Q4
and 73% growth in Total Income for FY23
“At Wise we are focused on our mission of building money without borders and bringing faster, fairer
options to more people and businesses around the world. To deliver on this mission we're building a
resilient, profitable business that our customers can trust to be here for them through good times and
through the challenges of a more uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“Customers continue to choose the Wise Account to manage their finances around the world, with
customers in the UK, EU and the US now able to receive a refund on a portion of their fees or earn a
return while retaining instant access to their money. Too many banks offer near-zero rates of interest
on deposits and we don’t think this is fair. Our new features set a global standard in how people and
businesses can hold their money. Customers trust us to hold £10.7 billion of their money, a 57%
increase YoY.
“In March, we also launched a new look inspired by the millions of customers we serve around the
world. With accessible layouts, and fonts that work across 146 languages, the new look matches the
ambition of our customers going international and supports our continued global expansion.
“Our financial results this quarter show great progress on our mission. Over 6 million people and
businesses used Wise for moving and managing their money internationally during the quarter; a 33%
increase YoY. And these customers moved nearly £27bn (+25% YoY). This growth drove a 45% YoY
increase in revenue, and when combined with net interest income from the Wise Account, resulted in
total income growth of 83% YoY for the quarter and 73% YoY for FY23.”
一 Kristo Käärmann, CEO & co-founder, Wise
Mission highlights Q4 FY23
Our mission is clear - to build ‘money without borders’ and make moving and managing money faster,
easier, cheaper and more transparent for people and businesses around the world.
During the quarter, we helped 6.1 million active customers move £26.7 billion in cross-border volume;
an increase of 33% and 25% YoY, respectively. Most of these new customers are joining to use the
Wise Account, proof of the increasing appeal for both people and businesses around the world.
As a result, revenue for the quarter grew 45% YoY and total income of £279.5 million grew 83% YoY.
This brought total income for FY23 to £964.3 million, which at 73% growth YoY is above our most
recent guidance of 68-72%.
Improving our product is key to how we grow and attract more customers. This quarter we launched
new features that allow customers to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment while
retaining full access to funds in their Wise Account. There are two main ways we’ve done this:
●

First, we have expanded the Wise Assets product to provide more customers with access to
interest earning assets. This includes launches across Singapore, France, Spain, Austria, the
1

Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg, in addition to the UK, which launched in December
2022. These funds allow our customers to earn returns in line with central bank rates.
●

Second, in Europe and the US1, we’re now giving customers a return on cash held in their Wise
Accounts by sharing some of the income we generate on these customer balances.

These new features enhance the proposition of the Wise Account for people and businesses, by
providing a return as central bank rates rise, whilst continuing to make sure our customers’ money is
safe and highly liquid.
Sustainably lowering prices for customers over the long run remains core to our mission. We charge
our customers what it costs us to offer our service, plus a small margin, rather than what we can get
away with. So our price, which reflects our cost to deliver payments, changes when our costs go up
or down. At 0.65%, the average price remained broadly stable when compared to the previous
quarter’s price.
It is our underlying infrastructure that powers our products and our customers’ ability to manage their
money and move it around the world at rapid speed. FY23 has been a milestone year for speed; with
55% of our cross-border payments completed instantly and over 90% completed within 24 hours in
Q4. Now customers can expect instant payments from Hong Kong, instant top ups in Brazil and 80%
of all payments to Poland to be delivered within the day.

Customer price is based on a fixed basket of representative currencies which reduces the effect from route mix and other factors,
making it a more accurate representation of our progress in reducing the cost of international transfers over time.

Wise Platform also went live with numerous new partners. This marks continued momentum with tech
partnerships and our early progress in onboarding large banks to bring Wise-powered payments to
their customers. This quarter we integrated with Bank Mandiri, Indonesia’s largest bank by assets and
one of the top established retail banks in the country. We have also seen momentum in integrating
US-based business service platforms including: Brex, Ramp, and Bluevine; automated global
electronic broker, Interactive Brokers; and global employment platform, Globalisation Partners.
These product improvements, innovations and partnerships mark continued progress toward our
long-term mission to help more people and businesses access fast, cheap, convenient and
transparent payments.
By operating a profitable and sustainable business, we have the capacity and confidence to continue
investing in future growth, through the cycle, and continue building the products and features our
customers love.
As always, more detail on our mission highlights for the quarter can be found on our website,
including our mission roadmap, which sets out future product improvements we have planned.

The appeal of Wise for customers around the world continues to drive strong active customer growth
of 33% YoY and 6% QoQ, with 6.1 million active customers in Q4 FY23, comprising 5.8 million personal
(+34% YoY, +6% QoQ) and 340K business customers (+27% YoY, +7% QoQ). This growth primarily
reflects customers joining Wise to use the Wise Account.
Continued growth in active customers drove cross border volumes higher in Q4 FY23 to £26.7 billion,
representing 25% growth YoY and 1% QoQ2. Personal customers moved £19.5 billion, 23% growth YoY,
while Business customers moved £7.3 billion, 30% growth YoY.
The average Volume Per Customer “VPC” reduced by 7% YoY and 4% QoQ. This was driven by
Personal VPC which reduced by 8% YoY and 3% QoQ as we continue to see a slower pace of growth
in higher-volume customer cohorts (>£10k). We believe payments amongst these cohorts, such as for
property purchases and investments, to be more discretionary in nature and influenced by
macroeconomic conditions to a greater extent. For example, as seen at times of FX volatility and USD
strength like earlier in FY23 when we saw a pull-forward of volume in these cohorts. This slower pace
of growth in the higher-volume customer cohorts (>£10k) combines with continued strong growth
among the more populous, lower-volume customer cohorts (<£10k), resulting in the reduction of the
average. Business VPC grew by 3% YoY as we continue to see business customers scaling their use
of Wise as they mature, and decreased 8% QoQ reflecting seasonality.
Revenue for Q4 FY23 was £223.5 million up 45% YoY and down 1% QoQ. Our take rate of 0.84% was
up +12 bps YoY and down -1 bps QoQ. Revenue growth continues to be supported by higher Other
Revenues generated from the greater adoption of the Wise Account, notably higher debit card spend
which drives interchange revenue.
2

On a constant currency basis, Q4 FY23 total volumes grew 25% YoY and 1% QoQ and 35% YoY for FY23. On a constant
currency basis, volume is converted to GBP using the average rates of the prior financial period.
3

The Wise Account and its value to customers has seen the cash customers hold with Wise grow to
£10.7 billion (+57% growth YoY), excluding the growing balances that are held through our Assets
features, reflecting the trust customers continue to place in us.
Balance growth, combined with higher yields on invested assets, led to an increase in gross interest
income, to £71.6 million for the quarter. Interest expense increased to £15.6 million, reflecting the
progress in our plans to share this benefit with more customers. As a result, net interest income was
29% higher QoQ, at £56.0 million (equivalent to a c.2% net yield). Consistent with our approach of
sharing economics with customers, which supports loyalty and trust, we are still working to share
more of this interest income with customers. This will likely result in a lower net yield, and thus a
smaller proportion flowing to EBITDA, over time.
Total income, inclusive of net interest income, for Q4 FY23 was £279.5 million, 4% growth QoQ and
83% growth YoY. This resulted in total income for FY23 of £964.3, 73% growth YoY, and above our
most recent guidance of 68-72%.
We will update the market on our FY24 guidance at our full year results in June 2023. Our previously
provided medium term forward-looking guidance remains unchanged:
●

Total income growth greater than 20% (CAGR)

●

Adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20%
