Wise plc
Q2 FY23 Trading Update
18 October 2022

Strong momentum continued in Q2, supporting our
improved outlook for the year

Wise is disrupting a massive and underserved market and in the second quarter we
helped 5.5 million active customers move £27 billion across borders, a 50% increase on the
same period last year.
Our success is thanks to our superior products that customers love. Our team continued
to improve our products. Wise is now available to more people and businesses, easier to
use, and more secure.
These products are powered by our infrastructure, and we delivered more than half of
our payments instantly for the second consecutive quarter. Whilst we continue to work
hard to lower prices, the average price increased in Q2 in response to higher FX costs.
We will continue to invest heavily in products and infrastructure and take the lead in
driving down the cost of cross-border transfers; and at the same time we maintain a
profitable business model that is highly cash generative.

Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder said:
“This quarter 5.5 million customers moved £27 billion with us, 50% more than in Q2 last
year and for the second consecutive quarter more than half our payments were instant.
The Wise Account and Wise Business products continue to see good levels of adoption
and this increased engagement with our product, higher volumes and faster speeds are
a result of the longer term investments that we have been making.
We’ve seen extreme macroeconomic conditions persist throughout the second quarter,
and whilst unfortunately this meant we had to raise prices slightly for some customers,
we’ve been working hard to limit these increases and are working to bring them back
down again.”

Customer price is based on a fixed basket of representative currencies which reduces the effect from route mix and other factors,
making it a more accurate representation of our progress in reducing the cost of international transfers over time.

We have four pillars that drive our mission: price, speed, convenience and transparency.
Our mission is to lower prices for customers over time. During this quarter, high levels of
FX volatility led to higher costs and as a result, the average customer price increased to
0.64% compared to 0.61% in Q1 FY23 and 0.62% in Q2 FY22.
However, we were able to lower fees for some currency routes. Through a new
partnership, we reduced fees when sending money to Chile and we negotiated cheaper
fees for sending money to China. In Brazil, we now use our own FX licence, which has
reduced the cost to deliver, and we’ve passed these savings on to our customers.
For the second consecutive quarter, we completed more than half of our transfers
instantly. Some of our payments in Brazil were slower, but we are rectifying this by
connecting directly into our partner bank’s API. After integrating with new partners, it’s
now faster to send money to Japan and Chile and transfers to Hong Kong got faster too.
We’re also continuing our work to speed up financial crime checks, which once completed
is expected to help reduce delays. Overall, approximately 90% of all transfers were
completed within 24 hours and speed remains an important feature for overall customer
experience.
Improvements made to our product and controls meant transactions are being paused
less often and as a result customers contacted us less than last quarter. We also grew our
Support Team so our wait times dropped by 50% when contacted by phone and email.
Product enhancements in the last few months have made it easier for customers to
onboard with us and have made Wise Account and Wise Business easier and more secure
to use. Below are some examples of improvements we've made:
●

Ability to use wire transfers to send to USD, previously only ACH payments were
available; and increased transfer limits when funded by Wise Account balance.

●

Over 200 countries and territories can now get USD SWIFT account details, so
customers can receive USD from pretty much anywhere in the world.

●

When sending money through Alipay in China, customers can now send directly to
Alipay Wallet.

●

Ability to move money with INTERAC e-Transfer Request in Canada.

●

We’ve added ways to get customer ID verified faster and easier.

●

Extra security on your account with a unique communication code.

●

Improved scam prevention and scam reporting.

●

Re-designed Business dashboard making it easier to find the features that matter
most to customers.

●

Businesses can get paid directly through Wise by sharing 'payment request' links.

●

The new “International Receive” feature allows our Platform partners to use Wise
as a correspondent, leveraging our SWIFT connection to receive funds from all over
the globe, rather than being connected to the SWIFT network themselves.

●

We expanded our partnership; adding the Swiss finance disruptor, Yapeal, and
financial wellbeing platform, Wagestream.

On our website you can find more detail on our mission highlights for the quarter, and our
mission roadmap, which sets out future product improvements we have planned.

As previously announced, we will now be presenting the components of “total income”
comprised of: revenue (as previously defined); and net interest income from customer
balances. Our adjusted EBITDA margin will now therefore be calculated as adjusted
EBITDA as a percentage of total income. Previously, net interest income from customer
balances and operating assets was included in EBITDA but presented between gross
profit and operating profit. A historical income statement for H1 FY22 and FY22 on this
basis is provided in the appendix to this announcement.
5.5 million customers transacted on Wise in Q2 FY23, an increase of 40% YoY and 10% QoQ,
comprising 5.2 million personal and 300K business customers. This increase in active
customers was mostly driven by greater adoption of the Wise Account and Wise Business
products, where customers tend to transact more frequently and use more features.
Regionally, the growth in active customers across our established markets has been

consistent, and we’re seeing strong growth in newer markets where we currently have a
smaller share.
Total cross-border volumes for Q2 FY23 were £27.0 billion, 50% higher YoY and 11% higher
QoQ. Personal volumes increased 49% YoY to £20.1 billion and Business volumes increased
55% YoY to £6.9 billion. Volume growth was driven by the higher number of active Wise
Account and Wise Business customers, who typically have a higher average volume per
customer (VPC). VPC continued to increase for both personal and business customers. The
growth also reflects to a lesser extent FX translation impacts and higher FX volatility. On a
constant currency basis1 volume grew 43% YoY.
Revenue for Q2 FY23 was £211.5 million, growing 59% YoY and 14% QoQ. Revenue for the
first half of FY23 was £397.4 million, 55% higher than the first six months of FY22.
Total income (revenue plus net interest income on customer balances) for Q2 FY23 was
£229.0 million, a 73% increase on last year. This included £17.5 million of net interest
income, and we expect this to increase in the second half of the year given the interest
rate outlook. We will share much of this interest income benefit with our customers,
through pricing, but we will also use some to invest in growth. Total income for H1 FY23
was £416.1 million, 63% higher than the same period last year.
Total income take rate, which includes net interest income, was 0.85% in the quarter.
Excluding net interest income, our take rate increased 2bps QoQ to 0.78% from 0.76% in Q1
FY23, reflecting the impact of price rises announced in August 2022 and an increase in the
other revenue line items. Other revenue benefited from greater uptake of customers
using the Wise Account in the form of higher debit card spend and interchange fees.
As a result of the continued strong momentum, and as outlined on 29 September 2022,
our financial guidance for the year has been upgraded. Our revised expectations are set
out below:
·

Total income growth between 55-60% in FY23 and greater than 20% (CAGR)
over the medium-term

·

Adjusted EBITDA margin over the medium term at or above 20% of total
income
