Q2 FY25 Trading Update
15 October 2024

Investments driving continued active customer and volume growth
●

Progress towards our long-term aim to become the network of choice for moving the
world’s money continues at pace with the number of active customers using Wise growing
by 23% YoY to 8.9m in Q2, driven primarily by existing customers recommending Wise.

●

Continued growth in customers and Wise account adoption drove a 20% YoY increase in
cross border volume (23% on a constant currency basis) to £35.2bn, a 20% YoY increase in
customer deposits and a 49% increase in card and other revenue.

●

In Q2, we continued to reduce and restructure our cross border pricing to sustainably drive
growth. The cross border take rate for the quarter was 59bps, an 8bps reduction YoY due to
lower prices (6bps) and a changing mix (2bps). The equivalent of 2bps of this reduction is
offset at an underlying income level by a corresponding increase in pricing on non-cross
border services as part of our restructuring of cost allocations.

●

Underlying income grew by 17% YoY to £337.0m in Q2, bringing growth in H1 to 19%. For
FY25, we continue to expect underlying income growth of 15-20%.

●

The underlying gross profit margin remains elevated at c76% for H1 FY25. This reflects the
scaling of costs of goods sold relative to volumes while we also continue investing to
support and drive growth.

●

Investments in pricing through H1 are expected to move us closer to achieving our
medium-term target underlying PBT margin range of 13-16% in H2. We therefore do not
currently anticipate making further material investments in reduced pricing in the second
half of FY25.

We remain focused on our mission of building the best way to move and manage the world’s money.
This will take time to fully achieve but we are pleased with the progress made during the quarter,
especially the additional regulatory approvals we have received in key markets that will enhance our
infrastructure and coverage, and consequently drive further growth in the years ahead.
Firstly, in India, we secured approvals to further unlock outward transfers, removing a previous USD
5,000 cap. This allows us to improve our proposition and grow our customer share in India, which is
expected to help us reduce the cost of sending to and from India over time. Secondly, in Australia, we
have been granted an Australian Financial Services Licence for Investments, enabling us to bring our
investment product ‘Assets’ to Australia later this year. And finally, in Brazil, we were delighted to be
given a Payments Institutions licence, granting us access to Brazil’s payment system (PIX) which,
once integrated, will be our sixth direct connection to domestic payment systems.
These are important steps on our journey to building the fastest, most cost-efficient infrastructure. In
the short term, our investments drive growth through a better proposition and sustainably lower
prices, which we expect over time to take us from moving billions to moving trillions of cross border
volume. Platform partnerships will be an important part of this journey and we were pleased to join
forces with AbbeyCross this quarter, bringing the power of the Wise infrastructure directly to their
customers via Wise Platform.
