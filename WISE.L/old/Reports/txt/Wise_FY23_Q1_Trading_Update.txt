Wise plc
Q1 FY23 Trading Update
19 July 2022

Continued growth in active users and volumes supported
strong revenue growth
In the first quarter of the financial year we continued to disrupt a massive and
underserved market, with 5 million active customers moving more than £24 billion
across borders; a 49% increase on the same period last year. We continued to save our
customers money by providing cross-border transfers at a highly competitive average
price of 0.61%.
We do this through our superior products: Wise Account, Wise Business and Wise
Platform. Our team has rolled out further product enhancements designed to make the
product more convenient to use and to enhance security features for businesses.
These products are powered by our infrastructure. In Q1 we saw more than half of our
payments delivered instantly. We see this as truly game changing versus the alternatives
that customers have today. And our customers love it.
So we continue to invest heavily in products and infrastructure, and take the lead in
driving down the cost of cross-border transfers whilst at the same time maintaining a
profitable business model.

Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder said:
“In the three months to 30 June 2022 we helped 5 million active customers move more
than £24 billion across borders, a 49% increase on last year. We also reached a key
milestone in our mission, more than 50% of all cross-border transfers are now completed
instantly.
Our Wise Account and Wise Business products got even better as we launched 2-step
payment approvals and employee spending controls on mobile for our business
customers. The average price that our customers paid for cross-border transactions
reduced from 0.67% to 0.61% in Q1 FY23 compared with the same period last year and
was unchanged compared with Q4 FY22.”

Customer price is based on a fixed basket of representative currencies which reduces the effect from route mix and other factors,
making it a more accurate representation of our progress in reducing the cost of international transfers over time.

We have four pillars that drive our mission: price, speed, convenience and transparency.
We aim to sustainably lower prices for customers over time. In the short-term changes in
the average customer price reflect the changes in what it costs to deliver cross-border
transactions. Through engineering away costs by becoming more efficient and
deepening our integration into local payment systems we have been able to reduce the
average price our customers pay. This was 0.61% in Q1 FY23 compared with 0.67% in Q1
FY22. The average price was flat compared with Q4 FY22 一 whilst we were able to reduce
fees for customers sending money to Mexico, Singapore, UAE and Kenya, this was offset
by additional servicing costs and costs of managing risks and uncertainty associated with
the current macroeconomic environment.
For the first time, we completed more than 50% of all cross-border transfers instantly. This
is a big milestone as it means that the majority of all payments are now completed in less
than 20 seconds, which has improved from 36% in Q1 FY22. This includes the roll-out of
instant transfers to Brazil, where we also launched the Wise Account in February 2022.
Currently, 90% of all transfers are completed within 24 hours, up from 88% last quarter.
Instant transfers are important for the overall customer experience and are a key driver of
our high net promoter score. Instant transfers also reduce the need for customers to
contact us asking for status updates on their transfer, which in turn helps keep servicing
costs lower for those transfers.
In the last three months we have made our products more convenient to use. Our
personal customers can now link their Wise Account to over 6,000 finance apps like
Venmo, Truebill and Chime. In Brazil, personal customers are now verified much more
quickly, with 97% of verifications completed within 24 hours. We have also enhanced
transparency of our customers’ transaction history, by introducing category icons and
making the name of the shop or business clearer.
Our business customers now have the ability to manage employee spending controls
through the mobile app and we have enabled 2-step payment approvals, providing
additional security to business owners. In the U.S. we have widened the roll-out of digital
cards, so now more business customers can offer digital cards to their employees,
removing the need for plastic cards.
We've built a new SWIFT Receive feature for Wise Platform partners. This allows financial
institutions not connected to the SWIFT network to now receive payments from all over
the world via SWIFT using their existing customer account details. The feature also
enables financial institutions with an existing SWIFT setup to process these incoming
SWIFT transfers more quickly, cheaply and conveniently. We also went live with new
partners including Monzo Business, Firstbase and Onfolk.
Our mission roadmap, which is publicly available through the Wise website, sets out the
improvements we have planned for each of our products.

Revenue as a % of volume

5 million customers transacted on Wise in Q1 FY23. The number of active personal
customers grew by 37% YoY to 4.7 million. We onboarded a million new customers,
supported by continued strong progress in the US and excellent product-market fit in
Brazil. The growth was also driven by increased adoption of the Wise Account and Wise
Business products, where customers tend to transact more frequently.
Total volume grew by 49% YoY and 14% QoQ to £24.4 billion. Volume growth was driven
by a higher number of active customers that are increasingly using the Wise Account and
Wise Business products, which in turn also leads to a higher average volume per
customer (VPC). The growth also reflects to a lesser extent, more variable drivers which
include people and businesses responding to increased levels of FX volatility and the
translation impact from FX movements which was a tailwind in the quarter, compared
with a headwind in FY22. On a constant currency basis volume grew 45% YoY.
Revenue grew by 51% YoY and 21% QoQ to £185.9 million, in line with our growth in
volume. Total take rate increased 4bps QoQ to 0.76%, reflecting the impact of price rises
announced in March, alongside a pick-up in other revenues. Other revenues benefited
from higher debit card spend and interchange fees as customers use the Wise Account.
Financial guidance for FY23 and the medium-term remains unchanged from the FY22 full
year results update. This includes:
·

Revenue growth of between 30-35% in FY23 and greater than 20% (CAGR) over
the medium-term

·

Adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20% over the medium-term.
