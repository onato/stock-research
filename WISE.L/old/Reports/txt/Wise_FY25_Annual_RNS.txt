Update on listing review
“Our growth over the past financial year is a testament to the team’s laser focus on our vision to build
money without borders. We moved £145.2 billion across borders for 15.6 million people and
businesses, a 23% increase compared to last year. This growth has been generated by the
investments we’ve made in our underlying infrastructure, delivering lower fees and faster speeds for
our customers: we reduced our take rate by 14bps over the year, to 53bps in Q4 FY2025. More
customers also benefited from instant payments, with approximately 65% of transactions being
completed in under 20 seconds.
We will accelerate our investments to improve the customer experience and to increase our share of
the huge c.£32 trillion market opportunity. Powered by our new payments infrastructure that is
fundamentally faster, cheaper, and more reliable than the traditional correspondent networks, we’re
well on our way to handle trillions, not just billions, and become ‘the’ global network for the world’s
money.
As part of our next step on that journey, today we are announcing our intention to dual list our shares
in the US and UK. We believe the addition of a primary US listing would help us accelerate our mission
and bring substantial strategic and capital market benefits to Wise and our Owners. These include
helping us drive greater awareness of Wise in the US, the biggest market opportunity in the world for
our products today, and enabling better access to the world’s deepest and most liquid capital market.
A dual listing would also enable us to continue serving our UK-based Owners effectively, as part of
our ongoing commitment to the UK. The UK is home to some of the best talent in the world in financial
services and technology, and we will continue to invest in our presence here to fuel our UK and global
growth.”

Highlights for the twelve months ended 31 March 2025
Strong growth in volume as Wise progresses towards moving trillions
●​ 23% increase in cross-border volume to £145.2bn driven by customer growth and greater
adoption of the Wise account.
●​ 15.6m active customers served in FY2025 (+21% YoY), with Personal customers growing by 22%
and Business customers up 11%.
●​ More customers continue to adopt multiple features within their Wise account; this is now around
50% of our personal and 60% of business customers. Customers are now holding more than
£21.5bn (+33% YoY) through the account (cash and Assets).
Growing fast and profitably
●​ Customer growth, account adoption and higher interest rates drove underlying income up 16%
YoY to £1.4bn (FY2024 £1.2bn) and revenue up 15% to £1.2bn, (FY2024 £1.1bn). After accounting
for costs and reinvestment, we generated £282m of underlying profit before tax (FY2024 £242m
+17%), equivalent to an underlying profit before tax margin of 21%.
●​ Reported profit before tax rose to £565m (FY2024 £481m, +17%) with basic earnings per share
of 40.37p (FY2024 34.20p, +18%).

Investments made in FY2025 will contribute to future growth
●​ We continued to enhance our infrastructure; we are now connected to the domestic payment
system in the Philippines (InstaPay) and received equivalent regulatory approvals in Brazil (PIX)
and Japan (Zengin), which will increase our direct connections to eight once live.
●​ We operationalised a new licence in India (AD-II) to remove historical transfer caps to further
unlock outward transfers. In Australia, ‘Interest’ is now live, allowing more customers to earn an
interest-like return by holding their money in government-guaranteed assets.
●​ Operational efficiencies and a significant effort to reduce prices for our customers enabled a
reduction in the cross-border take rate of 14bps from Q4 FY2024 to Q4 FY2025, while 65% of
payments are now instant.
●​ For businesses, we made it even easier to receive money, introducing Quickpay, our QR-code
feature and expanded the coverage of currencies to >20.
●​ The value of our infrastructure has been recognised with some of the world’s leading banks,
including Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered, choosing to partner with Wise.
Accelerating investment to serve as much of this huge, under-served market as possible
●​ We have committed to investing around £2 billion over the next two years, across infrastructure,
marketing and products, to capture even more of the substantial opportunity that exists for Wise.
●​ We are maintaining our guidance that, over the medium term, we expect to operate to an
underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16%; for FY2026, we expect to be around the top of this
range.
●​ We continue to expect underlying income growth of 15-20% CAGR over the medium term and for
FY2026.
Next stage of Wise’s journey with proposed dual listing of its shares in the US and UK
●​ The Board has concluded its review of our listing arrangements and, having assessed in detail
the optimal listing structure to accelerate our vision and maximise value for our stakeholders, we
intend to transfer our primary listing from the equity shares (transition) category on the London
Stock Exchange (“LSE”) to a US stock exchange, and to maintain a secondary listing on the LSE.
This would allow Wise’s shares to trade on both a US stock exchange and the LSE.
●​ The new listing arrangements are expected to include a structure that aligns with US market
practices including those of our US-listed tech peers, which we believe allows us to remain
laser-focused on delivering our mission, thus creating long-term value for shareholders.
●​ We believe the transfer of our primary listing would bring a number of benefits to Wise and our
Owners, including:
○​ Expanding the pool of investors able to invest in Wise, in particular US domestic
institutional and retail investors, the largest global constituent of investors, many of whom
are currently unable to hold our shares. Wise is a global business with a vision for as
many people and businesses to use our products as possible. We apply this same vision
to our Owner base, and want to enable as many people as possible to benefit from the
value we create.
○​ Increasing trading liquidity in our shares to give current and prospective Owners greater
flexibility and opportunity to buy and hold our shares.
○​ Providing a potential pathway to inclusion in major US indices, further enhancing liquidity
and demand for Wise shares. While Wise is not initially expected to be eligible for these
indices, a US primary listing provides the opportunity to work towards this inclusion.

○​ Helping to accelerate our growth in the US and advance our mission. We believe a
primary US listing would significantly enhance our profile among potential customers,
including for Wise Platform 一 the US is home to over 4,000 banks, including several of
the world’s largest.
○​ It would also more closely align us with major growth opportunities in the US. The US is
the world’s largest economy and the biggest market opportunity in the world for our
products today.
○​ By maintaining a listing in the UK, we would allow existing and future Owners continued
access to Wise stock in the UK.
●​ Our confidence in UK talent and the tech ecosystem here remains undimmed. One-fifth of our
employees are based in the UK and we plan to continue hiring and investing in our UK team to
fuel our growth in the UK and abroad.
●​ Wise intends to call a shareholder meeting in the coming weeks for our Owners to vote on the
proposal. Full details of the proposal will be included in the shareholder circular to be
published on or around 26 June 2025 ahead of the meeting.

An update from Kristo, our Co-founder and CEO
Becoming the network for the world’s money
Dear Wise Owners,
Fourteen years ago, we set out with a simple but ambitious vision: our money should work the same
abroad as it works at home. Paying someone in another currency shouldn’t cost us extra. It shouldn’t
be more expensive to use our cards when travelling. It should be as cheap and convenient for
businesses to sell to their clients abroad as it is to sell at home. Money should work without borders.
Guided by this singular vision, we have built the next generation cross-border money infrastructure
that today powers payments from over 50 countries, and a company that moved £145 billion for over
15 million people and businesses in the last year alone – saving them around £2bn in fees along the
way.
The size and value of the opportunity was self-evident when we listed in 2021 一 Wise’s direct listing
was the biggest listing of a tech company on the London Stock Exchange to date.
As our lives become more digital, our financial relationships will extend across borders even more.
People work, spend and invest internationally. Businesses now hire and sell everywhere. These
cross-border payments already add up to £32 trillion moved across borders each year.
We started with fixing overseas transfers and went on to develop the international Wise account for a
truly borderless banking experience for our customers, and now also make this infrastructure directly
available to banks through our APIs. We’re working to handle trillions, not just billions, and become
‘the’ global network for the world’s money.
Our growth over the past year is a testament to the Wise team’s laser focus on our long-term goals. In
FY2025, we moved £145.2 billion across borders for 15.6 million people and businesses. These are
well over double the number of active customers and volume from just four years ago when we listed.
And, in what might be the strongest reflection of the trust that we’re building with our customers, our
customer holdings grew 5.7x to £21.5 billion during the same four-year period.
As a result of this growth in customers, volume and balances, underlying income grew to £1.36 billion
in FY2025, up 16% (18% in constant currency) from last year, and more than triple compared to four
years ago. And underlying profit before tax grew to £282.1 million, up 17% from last year 一 nearly 7
times more compared to four years ago.
Unique and powerful new infrastructure
International payments outside of Wise feel broken, because the financial infrastructure they are
running on hasn’t been fit for purpose for decades. We are building a new global payments network
that directly connects local banks and payment systems at both ends of every transaction, bypassing
the traditional correspondent networks used by banks and other payment services, eliminating costly
intermediaries and outdated processes.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025

We are becoming increasingly experienced at building the direct connections with domestic payment
systems, refining and accelerating our integration process. During the year we went live with InstaPay
in the Philippines, marking our sixth direct integration to date. We were granted access to Japan’s
payments system, Zengin and secured the licence to access Brazil’s instant payments system, PIX.
The number of transfers arriving to recipients instantly, in less than 20 seconds, is an indicator of the
experience this new infrastructure gives to our direct customers, but also the customers of our Wise
Platform clients. The proportion of instant transfers increased from 49% three years ago to 65% this
year.
We expanded our global licensing footprint, closing the year with over 70 licences. In India, we
operationalised our new licence, removing a previous USD 5,000 transaction cap. And in Australia, we
were granted a license for investment services, allowing Australians to earn a return on their Wise
Account balances held in government-guaranteed assets.
We grow because our customers tell everyone about Wise. They do it because the products work
amazingly compared to their past experience with banks. And the products are so great because we
invest so much in the infrastructure beneath it.
Account for a truly international experience
About £32 trillion moves across borders, split across individuals, businesses and large enterprises.
We serve each of these customer groups through our three products: the Wise Account for personal
customers, Wise Business for small and medium-sized businesses and Wise Platform for banks and
other enterprises.
We brought Wise to more countries and groups, and added more features for existing customers to
make their international banking experience more satisfying and therefore even easier to recommend.
We launched Wise for Mexican nationals, and went live with the Wise Account and card for personal
customers in the Philippines. We also brought Wise Business to Hong Kong and Brazil, and launched
Invoicing and QuickPay for businesses globally.
Finally, we continued to roll out Assets with return-earning accounts for both personal and business
customers in more countries, including Australia, bringing the number of countries Assets is now live
in to 30 since we first launched in the UK in September 2021.
This year was a year of significant progress for Wise Platform. We partnered with two of South
America’s largest financial services providers, Nubank and Itaú Unibanco as well as global banks, like
Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered. These partnerships speak to the speed, scale and reliability
of the infrastructure and network we have built over the last 14 years.
Leading on price in an increasingly transparent market
It’s clear that whoever builds the lowest-cost, highest-quality infrastructure will move the world’s
money.
Supported by our scale, our discipline in cost optimisation and servicing expenses, this year, our
global take rate reduced from 0.67% to 0.53% in Q4 FY2025 一 our lowest to date.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

It’s never been cheaper to use Wise, but we are not done. New customers consistently switch to Wise
because our fees are radically lower than traditional banks. They’re doing the smart thing for their
wallets: global banks collect an estimated £200 billion annually in hidden retail cross-border fees.
That won’t last. As technology continues to evolve, these fees will come down, and Wise is leading
the charge.
External forces are also working in our favour. We see signs that financial conduct regulators will not
tolerate banks charging hidden cross-border fees to retail consumers. The EU has already legislated
against hidden fees, and some more forward-thinking banks are also adopting more transparent
pricing. As retail banks increase transparency and follow our lead in reducing prices, plus more digital
first options enter the market, our cost discipline remains ever more important in retaining our
long-term competitive advantage.
We expect that in the future world of transparent fees, people and business owners will be even more
actively looking for cheaper alternatives; it will then be too late for banks to start competing. Indeed,
the price drops we put into place at the start of the year are already having an effect, positively
impacting growth in larger volume transactions.
Our approach to compliance and combating financial crime
Like all banks and financial services companies, there is a risk that bad actors may try to use our
services for their financial crime such as fraudulent activity. To mitigate this risk, we need to be
technologically a step ahead of the bad actors.
We invest heavily behind this. Today, around a third of our global team is dedicated to preventing
financial crime, keeping our customers safe, and helping to ensure that we are in compliance with the
requirements of the over 70 regulatory licences we maintain globally. We also work in collaboration
with regulators and crime-fighting authorities around the world to prevent any misuse of our services.
Given an ever evolving landscape, we regularly assess and review our systems to identify and
address any potential gaps, and take into account regulator input, to enhance our strategies and
technologies to adapt to new threats to help ensure the highest standards of compliance and security.
We see financial crime prevention as a native function of our money moving infrastructure. It will be a
competitive advantage in a world, where threats grow in sophistication faster than most institutions
can improve their countermeasures.
Customer driven financial results
Our growth is fast and sustainable, with capital generation allowing us to comfortably reach our
profitable medium-term targets and invest continuously towards the massive, long term opportunities
still ahead of us.
The value we are creating is evident in the strong growth over the last 3 years. We see this in active
customers, which grew by 28% CAGR to 15.6 million, in our cross-border volumes, which grew by
24% CAGR to £145.2 billion, and in our customer holdings, which grew by 47% CAGR to £21.5 billion.
In order to continue on this path, we will continue to invest in a return-led and disciplined manner in
product, in pricing, in servicing and in marketing. As announced in our recent Owners Day, we plan to
double the annual investment made in running and growing Wise over the medium term. This includes

8

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

tripling our investment in marketing and growing our teams. These investments mean we will be able
to support more than twice as many customers. Investing in enhancing the awareness of our brand
and our products will ensure our growth remains strong amidst a growing and increasingly
competitive digital-first money transfer market.
As we scale, our unit costs also continue to decrease, which we can then translate into more
investment, including into price. In time, we expect further growth in customers and volume as the
price advantage we are driving becomes even clearer. This relationship was evidenced in FY2025
with our highest ever revenue recorded of £1.2 billion (FY2024 £1.1 billion) and profit before tax of
£564.8 million (FY2024 £481.4 million). These results show that we can decrease prices for
customers while maintaining profitability, and so support our business model to scale and allow us to
reinvest to be able to build the best product for our customers.
After considering these costs and reinvestments, we are committed to our medium-term guidance for
underlying income growth of 15-20% and underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16%. For FY2025,
underlying income growth was 16% in reported currency (18% in constant currency) and the
underlying profit before tax margin was 21%. In FY26, we expect underlying income growth to be
within the guided range, with the underlying PBT margin to be around the top of the guided range as
we prudently ramp-up investments towards the enormous opportunity ahead of us.
Onwards - the journey to move trillions
The relentless expansion of our products and geographic reach, improvements in cost and speed
through infrastructure build-out, increasing adoption and increasing scale, means we’re increasingly
generating value for customers and our owners along the way. This alignment between our customers
and our owners gives us every reason to be enthusiastic about our long-term vision of becoming the
network for the world’s money.
In the near term, we will continue to provide the best cross-border experience for our customers
which will drive growth in our volumes. In the medium term, we want to be the number one
international account, and in the long term, we will also be providing the world’s best correspondent
infrastructure.
We have made significant progress over the last year and I’m very pleased that we were able to help
15.6 million customers move money across borders in FY2025. However, our ambition is to do so
much more 一 we are still at the start of our journey when we consider the size of the market we want
to serve.
Looking at the massive opportunities ahead of us, I am confident that our continued focus and
disciplined, long-term oriented investments will only accelerate our path to become ‘the’ network for
money around the world.
As a next step on this journey to move trillions, we are intending to dual list our shares in the US and
UK. We believe the addition of a primary US listing with a secondary UK listing would help us drive
greater awareness of Wise in the US, the biggest market opportunity in the world for our products
today. Additionally, it would enable more investors to benefit from the value we create and our shares
would be more liquid, giving Owners more flexibility and opportunity. A dual listing would also enable

9

us to continue serving our UK-based Owners effectively as part of our ongoing commitment to the
UK, where we will continue to invest to fuel our UK and global growth.

An update from Emmanuel, our CFO
We remain focused on our mission, balancing growth with driving efficiencies​
FY2025 was another year of strong growth led by an expansion in active customers. We continued
investing in our customers by reducing our prices and building the infrastructure they need to move
and manage money around the world, while also broadening our product offering. During FY2025
over 15.6 million customers used Wise for cross-border transactions and a growing number used
other Wise products. This has resulted in a strong financial performance for the year, with 16%
underlying income growth (18% in constant currency) and an underlying profit before tax margin of
21%, which was above our medium-term target of 13%-16%. Revenue increased by 15%, with
reported profit before tax increasing to £565 million (FY2024 £481 million), representing a reported
profit before tax margin of 34%.
Customer-led growth​
In FY2025 our customers sent or converted £145.2 billion of volume (cross-border volume), an
increase of 23%, or 25% on a constant-currency basis. This was primarily led by growth in active
customers of 21% to 15.6 million, with 5.9 million new customers joining Wise and completing their
first cross-border transaction. We continued to deliver double-digit growth across all five of our
geographical segments (Europe, United Kingdom, North America, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the
World).
Active personal customers grew 22% to 14.9 million, with personal cross-border volumes growing by
22% to £106.4 billion.
We continued to see an increased usage of the Wise Account, with an adoption rate of c.50% at the
end of FY2025, defined as the percentage of active customers who have adopted more than one
product. This adoption is driving a continuation of the higher growth in ‘card-only’ customers, or
customers who only use their Wise card for cross-border activity.
Historically, these customers have had a cross-border VPC of £500 to £1,000 per quarter. In Q4 2025,
the proportion of active personal customers who were ‘card-only’ was c.20%.
Personal VPC in Q4 FY2025 was £3,200, which was up 7% compared to Q4 FY2024. This reflects
higher growth in high-volume customers in Q4 FY2025, as our pricing has made us more attractive
for this group.
Active business customers increased by 11% to 0.7 million, with cross-border volumes growing by
24% to £38.8 billion.
Business customer growth sequentially accelerated in Q4 FY2025, as we resumed the onboarding of
business customers in the US and UK, following the pause in H2 FY2024. Business cross-border
volumes grew at a faster rate than active customers, driven by an increase in VPC.
Compared with cross-border volume growth of 23%, cross-border revenue grew by 6% to £840.4
million, reflecting a reduction in the average take rate for FY2025 of 9bps to 58bps as we reinvested
efficiency gains through lower pricing with the aim of driving increased volumes.
Wise Account adoption is driving increased customer retention and we are seeing a broader use of
Wise products for business too. Within FY2025 revenue of £1.2 billion, card revenue (which primarily

11

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

consists of interchange revenue), increased 31% in FY2025 to £219.8 million. Other revenue (which
largely comprises business customer account set-up fees, fees for replacement cards and revenue
from Wise Assets), increased by 71% to £151.7 million.
Additionally, underlying interest income rose by 25% to £150.4 million, due to a 29% growth in
customer balances to £17.1 billion combined with higher interest income yields. Underlying income,
which consists of cross-border revenue, card revenue, other revenue, and underlying interest
income, increased 16% to £1.36 billion (18% on a constant currency basis), while revenue itself
increased 15% to £1.21 billion and total interest income 22% to £594.3 million.
Underlying gross profit expansion enables reinvestment into growth​
Cost of sales and net credit losses increased by 5% to £337.2 million in FY2025, whereas revenue
increased by 15% and underlying income grew by 16%. Costs decreased in FY2024 with these
reductions sustained through FY2025. Underlying income benefited from active customer growth and
Wise account adoption, delivering an increase of 20% in both underlying gross profit and gross profit
to £1,025.1 million and £1,307.8 million, respectively.
Underlying gross profit margin was 75% in FY2025, up 2 percentage points versus FY2024.
Underlying gross profit enables us to fund significant investments in the business, reduce our prices
and provide a better experience for our customers whilst also delivering our target underlying profit
margin. During FY2025 we were pleased to reduce cross-border prices by over 9 basis points,
sustainably reinvesting gross profit margin into lower prices – a key reason why customers choose to
join Wise.
Administrative expenses for the year increased by 25% to £768.6 million. This reflects our continued
investment in future growth, as well as in the capacity required to onboard and serve a fast-growing
active customer base that is increasingly using more features. In FY2025 we saw an increase in
third-party costs, as we continued to outsource the provision of specific elements of our servicing
operations, allowing us to flex capacity at a lower cost.
At 31 March 2025, we had over 6,500 Wisers, an increase of more than 2,000 employees over the last
three years. The growth in our team resulted in employee benefit expenses increasing 9% to £412.7
million in FY2025. We expect to add c.700 roles over the course of FY2026. These Wisers will help us
on our mission: building products, improving our infrastructure, supporting our core functions and
helping to attract and serve even more customers.
We continue to invest in our customer acquisition efforts, with a focus on improving the effectiveness
of our marketing programme. In FY2025 our marketing spend was £53.8 million, an increase of 47%,
with our Marketing team growing by 30%. We aim to drive incremental adoption and engagement as
we continue to invest across multiple channels, including an expansion into awareness marketing and
a greater level of investment into performance marketing. In FY2025 we launched our first brand
campaign in Australia, which delivered encouraging results, reaching over 4 million people and
driving an increase in awareness of 11 percentage points.
Technology costs increased by 23% to £65.9 million and expenses relating to consultancy and
outsourced services increased by 42% to £128.1 million, both reflecting the greater services required
to support the growth of the business.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

Strong, sustained profitability profile​
In FY2025 we generated an underlying profit before tax of £282.1 million at a 21% margin, an increase
of 17% over FY2024, reflecting our continued investment in the business. Our underlying profit before
tax margin was strong at 21%, above our sustainable margin target of 13%-16% for the mid-term.
Reported profit before tax of £564.8 million for the year is calculated by adding ‘interest income
above the first 1% yield’ (£443.9 million in FY2025) and deducting benefits paid relating to customers’
balances (£161.2 million).
Of this £443.9 million of interest income above the first 1% yield in FY2025, our interest income
framework aims to retain 20% (£88.9 million) and to return the remaining 80% (£355.0 million) to
customers. In FY2025 we managed to pay £161.2 million to customers (45% of our target), while
retaining £282.7 million.
We were unable to return the other 55% of our target for several reasons, including: where the
deposits are in jurisdictions where we are unable to pay interest or cashback for regulatory reasons
(e.g. the UK, which made up two-thirds of the 55%); where we do not yet pay interest or cashback on
all currencies; and in some geographies such as the US, where customers are required to ‘opt-in’ to
receive interest but have not yet done so. Where customers do not currently receive interest or
cashback on their balance, our priority is to launch and promote our Assets ‘Interest’ product, which
provides a market rate of return, while still offering all the other benefits of the Wise Account. This
option is available for customers in the UK, EEA, Australia and Singapore.
Reported profit before tax grew 17% to £564.8 million in FY2025, with earnings per share of 40.37p.
Highly liquid and well capitalised​
As at 31 March 2025, we held £18.6 billion of cash and highly liquid investment grade assets, up 28%
from £14.5 billion at the end of FY2024. This includes assets in respect of the £17.1 billion of customer
balances. It also includes £1.4 billion of our ‘own cash’ (£1.1 billion at the end of FY2024), with the
increase from our operating performance partly offset by a reduction in our rolling credit facility
drawings as we repaid half of the RCF draw down given our strong cash position.
We are well capitalised for the future, and as at 31 March 2025 our Group eligible capital was £1.3
billion, including the now-audited FY2025 profits; significantly above our minimum regulatory capital
requirements.
Our capital position, built through sustained profitability, enabled us to initiate a programme in FY2023
to reduce the dilutive impact on share count that arises through stock-based compensation (SBC).
£10 million of our capital was used in FY2023 by our Employee Share Trust to fund such share
purchases, rising to £68 million in FY2024 and £73 million in FY2025, which covered the impact of
new grants issued during the year.
At our Owners Day on 3 April 2025, we announced our intention to expand our programme of share
purchases for the Employee Share Trust, with the expansion taking us beyond those for in-year SBC
grants to now also begin acquiring shares for historical SBC grants, which represent c.25 million
shares and c.2.5% of issued capital.
Also, as part of our corporate finance strategy, we entered into a £520 million Safeguarding Insurance
policy during FY2025, allowing for this amount of customer funds to be used for operational customer

liquidity, with the insurance providing full customer security. We also refinanced our RCF on an
unsecured basis and underwent a credit scoring process in November 2024 and received investment
grade ratings of BBB from both S&P and Fitch. Our aim is to optimise the funding of our working
capital in the coming years.
Regulatory Development​
As we continue to expand our product and coverage we aim to be compliant with all regulations in the
markets that we operate in. However, with an evolving regulatory, political and financial crime
landscape we occasionally don’t achieve this goal, and where we or regulators identify gaps in our
processes or controls then actively engaging with the relevant regulator we act quickly to identify
remediation plans. Late in FY2025 we agreed a consent order with the CFPB in relation to some
historic technical issues which had been fully remediated at the time of the consent order. The CFPB
originally fined us $2 million, but the Consent order was recently amended with an adjustment to the
findings and the penalty reduced to $45,000.
Relentless focus on the long-term opportunity​
The opportunity for Wise remains substantial, with many millions of people and small businesses
moving trillions of pounds across borders while overpaying for a poor service. We fundamentally
believe that the market leader over time will be the provider of the cheapest, fastest and most
convenient service, with the broadest coverage.
We remain focused on unlocking this opportunity and will continue to invest in our long-term growth
potential, building a business with world-class fundamentals and the potential to scale volumes from
billions to trillions, and generating exceptional value for both the customers and owners of Wise.
As we deliver on our mission, we continue to target 15-20% CAGR for underlying income (with
FY2024 as a base year) and an underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16% over the medium-term.
We expect our reported profit before tax to continue to be higher than underlying profit before tax as
long as the effective interest rate we achieve on customer balances is greater than 1%.
Improvements in efficiency gained in FY2025 resulted in an inflated level of earnings, which we
expect to reinvest back in the business. We plan to scale our ability to invest in the business in order
to fuel many more years of growth. Over the medium term, we aim to double our annual spend on the
running, and growing, of Wise. This will include a tripling of our investment into marketing, alongside
increased hiring in our Product and Engineering teams. This investment will particularly support the
planned initiatives across Wise Business and Wise Platform, the investment needed to support a
larger business, and our continued efforts to reduce our average cross-border pricing.
Strong financial performance with world-class fundamentals​
We have built a unique business with world-class fundamentals, delivering strong growth and high
profitability. As we continue investing for the long term with the aim of becoming ‘the’ network for the
world’s money, we are delivering on our mission and creating massive value for both our customers
and shareholders.

1. The merger reserve arises from the Group’s pre-listing reorganisation accounted for as a capital reorganisation. Upon the reorganisation, the Group's Ordinary Shares
have been re-presented as those of Wise plc. The difference between Wise Payments Limited’s net assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the
merger reserve.
2. Other reserves predominantly relate to investments into highly liquid bonds measured at FVOCI. For these investments, changes in fair value are accumulated within the
FVOCI reserve within equity. During the year £10.3m of fair value gains were recognised in other comprehensive income (2024: £10.9m), including £3.5m of tax charge
(2024: £3.5m). Refer to note 10 for further information on the tax recognised on bonds. On disposal of these debt investments before maturity, any related balance within
the FVOCI reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025

Note 1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
1.1 General information
Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England.
The address of its registered office is 1st Floor Worship Square, 65 Clifton Street, London, United
Kingdom, EC2A 4JE. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) is the
provision of cross-border and domestic financial services. Further information on the Group’s
operations and principal activities is presented in the Strategic Report.

1.2 Accounting information and policies
Introduction
This section describes the basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the
Group’s accounting policies that are applicable to the financial statements as a whole. The Group’s
material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgements specific to a note, are
included in the note to which they relate. Furthermore, the section details new accounting standards,
amendments and interpretations, that the Group has adopted in the current financial year or will adopt
in subsequent years.
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the
UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in conformity with the applicable legal requirements
of the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the
preceding financial year, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. All financial information is presented
in millions of pounds sterling (‘£’), which is the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest
£0.1m, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention modified to include the fair valuation of particular financial instruments, to the extent
required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
(b) Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development and
position are set out in the Strategic report.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the
Group has the available resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
The going concern assessment is based on the detailed forecast prepared by management and
approved by the Board (base plan). As part of the going concern review, the Directors have

23

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

considered severe, but plausible, downside scenarios to stress test the viability of the business.
These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and liquidity as
well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Appropriate
assumptions have been made in respect of revenue growth and profitability, based on the economic
outlook over the forecast period. Appropriate sensitivities have been applied in order to stress test the
base plan, considering situations with lower revenue growth and profitability compared to the base
plan, where future trading is less than forecasted. Management expects that sufficient liquidity and
regulatory capital requirement headroom are maintained throughout the forecast period.
The Directors have made inquiries of management and considered forecasts for the Group and have,
at the time of approving these financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operations for the foreseeable future. Further details are contained
in the Viability Statement of the Strategic Report.
(c) Basis of consolidation
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Wise plc and its
subsidiaries as at 31 March 2025.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies
within the Group are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Group accounting policies
are consistently applied to all entities and transactions.
(d) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Items included in the
financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective
functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction is recognised.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange
rates are recognised in profit or loss (either as cost of sales or administrative expenses).
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates if held at historical cost,
or year end exchange rates if held at fair value, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are

24

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

recognised in either the income statement or shareholders’ equity depending on the treatment of the
gain or loss on the asset or liability.

Group companies
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the
currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are translated into pounds sterling as follows:
●​ assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing exchange
rate at the reporting date;
●​ income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates; and
●​ all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(e) Changes in material accounting policies and disclosures
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the Group from 1
April 2024:
a.​ Amendment to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current
Liabilities with Covenants
As a result of the adoption of the amendments to IAS 1, the Group has classified its borrowings as

non-current, because it has the right to defer payment for more than 12 months. Refer to note 17 for
further details.
b.​ Other amendments:
●​ Amendments to IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
●​ Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier Finance Arrangements
The adoption of the other amendments did not have a material impact on the Group. There are no
other new or revised standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial
year beginning on or after 1 April 2024 that would be expected to have a material impact on the
Group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted​
The following amendments have been published by the IASB and are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2025; the amendments have not been early-adopted by the Group:
a.​ New standard issue - IFRS 18 Primary Financial Statements
The new standard, which replaces IAS 1, creates detailed requirements for the classification and
aggregation of income and expenses in the income statement, and disclosure requirements for
management-defined performance measures. The new standard is effective from 1 January 2027, but
has not yet been endorsed for use in the UK. It is anticipated that the application of the new standard
will have an impact in the Group’s presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025

b.​ Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 - Classification and Measurement of Financial
Instruments
The amendments clarify the derecognition of financial liabilities via electronic payments, refine the
classification of financial assets with ESG-linked features, and enhance disclosure requirements for
equity instruments at FVOCI. The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2026. It is anticipated that the application of these amendments may have an impact in
the Group’s consolidated financial statements in future periods.
c.​ Other amendments:
●​ Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeability
●​ IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures
Neither of the other amendments is expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or
future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.
(f) Climate change considerations
The impact of climate change has been considered as part of the assessment of estimates and
judgements in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements. Our climate risk assessment
has primarily focused on short-term risks to determine if they pose a material threat to the business,
and it has concluded that climate-related risks do not currently pose a material risk to
Wise, and has identified no material financial impact to these financial statements.

1.3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of the critical judgement which the Directors consider could have a significant impact on these
financial statements is set out in the following notes:
●​ Customer balances (recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the
balance sheet) - note 15 and note 16
Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of estimation.

Note 2. Segment information

Accounting policy
The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment.The information regularly reported to the
Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’), which is currently the Board of Directors of the Group,
for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of performance, is based wholly on the
overall activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s business model, the Group has determined
that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is provision of cross-border and
domestic financial services.
​
​
​
The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for the reportable segment can be determined by reference
to the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of
revenue by type of customer and geographical region is set out in note 3.

Note 3. Revenue
Accounting policy
The Group generates revenue from contracts with customers by transferring the following services:
Cross-border
The Group primarily generates revenue from cross-border services, which includes money
transfers, conversions and the Wise Account. The applicable fees depend on a number of factors,
including the currency route, the transaction size, the type of transaction being undertaken and the
payment method used.
A customer enters into a contract with the Group at the time of opening a Wise Account or initiating
a money transfer. The customer agrees to the contractual terms by formally accepting the terms
and conditions of the respective service, on Wise’s website or the app.
The revenue is recognised at the point in time the performance obligation has been satisfied. For
money transfers, the revenue is recognised upon delivery of funds to the recipient. For money
conversions, it is recognised when a customer balance is converted into a different currency in
their account.
The time required for the Group to process the payment to the recipient, and therefore to satisfy its
performance obligations, largely depends on the processing time its banking partners require to
deliver funds to the recipient. As such the revenue is deferred until the funds are delivered.
Transactions in certain jurisdictions, where the Group has settlement accounts with central banks,
transfers between Wise accounts or conversions within a Wise Account, are generally fulfilled
instantly.
Card
Card revenue refers to debit card services and mainly comprises interchange fees and card usage
fees.

27

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

A customer enters into a contract with the Group at the time the card, either virtual or physical, is
made available for use and the customer is able to either make a payment or a withdrawal.
The fees for card transactions are in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. They have
a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognised upon transaction capture, that the
performance obligation is deemed to have been satisfied.
Other
Other revenue mainly comprises:
●​ Revenue earned from the top-up of Wise account balances or transfers to recipients in the
same currencies. The revenue is recognised on transaction completion for top-ups and
delivery of funds to the recipient for transfers.
●​ One-time fee charged to Wise business customers for setting up an account; the revenue is
recognised over time, throughout the period the customer is expected to use the business
account.
●​ Fees earned for the provision or replacement of physical cards; the revenue is recognised
over time throughout the period the debit card services are provided, which is expected to
be the life of the card.
●​ Revenue from the multi-currency investment feature called Wise Assets (‘Assets’), where
Wise generates revenue from charging a fee based on the value of the assets under
custody. The revenue is accrued on a daily basis, based on the daily value of the assets
under custody, and is recognised over time in line with the period the Group provides its
services to Assets customers. The Group acts as an agent on behalf of the customers and
does not retain control nor benefits from the Assets, thus it does not recognise the financial
assets and the respective liabilities for the Assets, and derecognises customer funds on
purchase.
Rebates
Wise offers certain rebates in the form of a fee refund or cashback for eligible revenue-generating
transactions. The rebate is recognised as a liability at the time of completion of the eligible
transaction and is deducted from revenue.

Accounting policy
Cost of sales comprises the costs that are directly associated with the Group’s principal revenue
streams of money transfer, conversion services and debit card services. This includes:
• banking and other fees, net of applicable rebates, incurred in processing customer transfers and
the costs of providing cards to customers;
• net foreign exchange costs generated due to customer transactions, including the costs related
to the difference between the published mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate
obtained by the Group in acquiring currency. Within the same line are included the net foreign
exchange differences from the revaluation of customer balances at period end. Other product costs
include product losses that are directly generated from customer transactions, including
chargeback losses, as well as taxes directly attributable to customer activity.

Note 10. Tax
Accounting policy
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, respectively.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised, or the deferred tax
liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and
liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets on
share-based payments are recognised for the share options not exercised at the balance sheet
date. The deferred tax assets on share-based payments are determined based on the share price
at the balance sheet date. The impact of recognition is split between income tax expense in profit
or loss for the year, for the element up to the cumulative remuneration expense; and the

34

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

share-based payment reserve, recognised directly in equity, for the element in excess of the
related cumulative remuneration expense.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or
different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the
Group operates. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax
accounting for the impacts of the top-up taxes and accounts for these as current tax when
incurred.

Represented by:

The deferred tax asset is predominantly generated in the UK and the US and mainly comprises unexercised share options which are forecast to be
exercised within four years and as such are less sensitive to changes in long-term profit forecasts. The deferred tax asset on share options is impacted by
the future share price.
The deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine recoverability and to determine a reasonable time frame for utilisation. To
determine this, the Group uses the approved Group forecast used for the viability statement and going concern analysis. The Group considers it is
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the coming years to realise the majority of the deferred tax asset. Consequently, the Group has
recognised a deferred tax asset of £84.7m (2024: £103.0m), with a remaining £3.9m unrecognised deductible temporary differences relating to foreign tax
credits (2024: £nil).
Both the UK and the US utilised brought forward losses in FY2023 and in FY2024, with the UK taxable losses fully utilised as at 31 March 2024 and the US
taxable losses fully utilised as at 31 March 2025. Therefore, there are no deferred tax assets in respect of losses recognised in the UK and the US as at 31
March 2025.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting published on 20
December 2021 introduced the Pillar Two model rules designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy. The
Pillar Two regulation provides for an international framework of rules aimed at ensuring that worldwide profits of multinational groups are subject to tax at
a rate not lower than 15% in every jurisdiction in which a group operates.

39

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

The Group operates in the United Kingdom (amongst other locations), which has enacted new legislation to implement the global minimum top-up taxes.
The first period for which enacted legislation is effective for the Group is the year ended 31 March 2025.
The Pillar Two rules provide for a transition period in which the in-scope multinational groups are excused from undergoing the complex effective tax rate
calculation required by the new piece of legislation. In particular, the Pillar Two legislation provides for a transitional safe harbour (“TSH”) that applies for
the first three fiscal years following the entry into force of the relevant regulation and deems the top-up tax due in a jurisdiction to be zero where the TSH
tests are met.
The Group has performed an assessment of the Group’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes, including assessment of the TSH tests. This calculation is
based on the accounting data for the fiscal year 2025. Based on the calculation, the Group does not expect any material top-up taxes under enacted or
substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation for the year ended 31 March 2025.

Note 11. Earnings per share
Basic EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the Group’s owners by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, including, the ordinary
shares issuable for no consideration for which all conditions are satisfied (25.6 million shares as at
31 March 2025 and 39.1 million shares as at 31 March 2024).
Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from both basic
and diluted EPS calculations. At the end of the reporting period, there were 14.6 million (31 March
2024: 22.9 million) shares held in the ESOP Trust.
The diluted EPS calculation adjusts the weighted average number of shares used in the basic EPS
calculation by assuming all potentially dilutive shares convert into ordinary shares. Rights granted
to employees under employee share award plans, with a strike price and/or with conditions which
have not yet been met, are considered to be potential dilutive shares and therefore have been
included in the calculation of diluted EPS.

Note 12. Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Items of property,
plant and equipment are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Computer equipment is not recorded in property, plant and equipment, but expensed as low-value short-lived equipment.
The accounting policy for right-of-use assets is included in note 18.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available for use, so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value
over their estimated useful lives; these values and lives are reviewed each year. Subject to these reviews, the estimated useful lives assigned to
principal categories of assets are as follows:
●​ Right-of-use assets: lease term (1-10 years)
●​ Leased office improvements: lease term (1-10 years)
●​ Office equipment: 5 years*
Change in estimates
During the financial year, the Group has entered into new long-term leases in several locations and conducted a review of the useful lives of leased
office improvements and office equipment. As a result, the expected useful life of the leasehold improvements was updated to the lease term and the
useful life of the office equipment increased from 2 to 5 years. The effect of these changes on the depreciation expense for the financial year and the

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Reviews are carried out if there is an indication that assets may be impaired, to ensure that property, plant and equipment are not carried at above their
recoverable amounts.

Impairment loss
During the financial year, the Group moved or transferred part of its operations into new leased premises and as part of this tested for impairment the right
of use asset and the related leased office improvements for office space that will no longer be utilised. An impairment loss of £11.5m (2024: nil) was
subsequently recognised from writing down to its recoverable amount the right of use asset and the related leased office improvements. The recoverable
amount was determined by reference to either the fair value less costs to sell or value in use where applicable. The impairment loss is included in
administrative expenses in the statement of profit or loss.

Note 13. Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets predominantly relate to internally generated software and other intangible assets and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Internally generated software
The Group develops software used in the provision of its services. Only the development costs that are directly attributable to the design, development
and testing of new software controlled by the Group are capitalised. Other development expenditures that do not meet the recognition criteria are
recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part
of the software product comprise software development employee costs.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets primarily include licences and domain purchases. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life or
the term of the contract.
Amortisation
The Group amortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for mobile applications which are amortised over 2
years, and licence purchases that are amortised over a period of 2-10 years.
Impairment of intangible assets
Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indicator that they might be impaired, for example when the assets are no longer in
use and need to be decommissioned.

Note 14. Trade and other receivables

Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from payment processors, partners,
brokers and customers, and collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties. Trade and
other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
less impairment for expected credit losses. The carrying values of current trade receivables
approximate their fair values due to their short maturity.
Trade and other receivables are presented as current in the statement of financial position if it is
expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle; and/or
expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified
as non-current.
The Group recognises impairment loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets
that are measured at amortised cost. The impairment loss allowance, recognised during the year,
relates to chargebacks and negative customer balances. For chargebacks, the Group has
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for
forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. For negative
customer balances, if an active non-fraudulent account goes more than 30 days past due,
according to the Group policy, it is perceived as an indication of a significant increase in credit risk
and the receivable is provided in full.
Refer to note 19 for further information on expected credit losses.

*Receivables from customers disclosed are net of expected credit loss provision of £46.6m as at 31 March 2025
(2024: £41.3m). The movement in the provision for the year is predominantly related to increased activity and the
related increase in customer balances, which resulted in the increase of negative customers’ balances older than
30 days. Customer chargebacks decreased by £0.9m to £1.6m at 31 March 2025 (31 March 2024: £2.5m) and
negative customer balances increased by £6.1m to £45.0m (31 March 2024: £38.9m).

Note 15. Cash and cash equivalents
Accounting policy
Cash and cash equivalents include on-demand deposits, term deposits used for meeting
short-term cash commitments, deposits (with collateral) held, money market funds (MMFs) and
other short-term high-quality liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less, and
e-money held with payment processing partners. Due to the short duration of the cash and cash
equivalents (less than 3 months), the fair value approximates the carrying value at each reporting
period.
Cash and cash equivalents is presented as current in the statement of financial position, unless it is
restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.
Cash in transit to customers represents cash that has been paid out from the Group bank accounts
but has not been delivered to the bank account of the beneficiary.
Cash collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties are recognised under ‘Trade and
other receivables’ in the statement of financial position.
Customer deposits
As disclosed above, the Group recognises financial assets and liabilities for the funds customers
hold in their Wise accounts, and the funds collected from customers as part of the money transfer
settlement process that have not yet been processed. The liability is recognised upon receipt of
cash or capture confirmation (depending on pay-in method), and is derecognised when cash is
delivered to the beneficiary.
Principles to determine the point of delivery are the same as applied in revenue recognition, see
note 3.
Critical accounting judgement
Customer balances
The Group recognises financial assets and corresponding liabilities for the funds customers hold in
their Wise accounts and the funds the Group receives as part of the money transfer settlement
process. At the point that the cash is received from the customer, the Group becomes party to a
contract and has a right and an ability to control the economic benefit from the cash flows
associated with this balance. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have
a legally enforceable right to set off these financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle
them on a net basis or settle them simultaneously. Therefore, management has concluded that the
recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the balance sheet is
appropriate.

Cash at banks and in transit between Group bank accounts include term deposits of £204.2m (2024:
£285.8m). Their settlement date is three months or less.
Of the £13,982.8m (2024: £10,479.2m) cash and cash equivalents at the year end, £1,430.2m (2024:
£1,061.1m) is the corporate cash balance of the Group. This balance is not related to customer funds,
which are held in Wise accounts, or collected from customers as part of the money transfer
settlement process. ​
​
​
The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to
customer funds. Such requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. Within the £7,845.9m (2024: £6,570.3m) of cash at banks and in transit between Group
bank accounts is £5,807.5m (2024: £5,290.5m) of customer funds in segregated, safeguarding bank
accounts and term deposits held at investment grade banking institutions, or the highest possible
credit-rated institutions in non-investment grade jurisdictions (bank ratings being limited by the
relevant country rating). The remainder of safeguarded customer deposits were held across highly
liquid global money market funds (MMFs), treasury bonds and investment grade corporate paper, as
allowed by local regulations. In addition, during the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group has
introduced a hybrid approach to safeguarding UK customer funds by implementing Safeguarding via
Comparable Guarantees, of total value of £520.0m, with nine investment grade sureties. The Group
holds the amount equal to the value of these guarantees in our customer network to support
customer activity and liquidity.

Note 16. Trade and other payables
Accounting policy
Accounts payable consist of obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in
the ordinary course of business from suppliers on the basis of normal credit terms and do not bear
interest.
Wise accounts relate to the funds customers hold in their Wise accounts and the funds the Group
receives as part of the money transfer settlement process. They are non-derivative liabilities to
personal or business customers for money they hold with the Group and do not constitute
borrowings. Refer to note 15 for details of the judgement management has exercised in relation to
customers’ balances and the recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on
the balance sheet.

Payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables are presented as current in the statement of financial position if it is
expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; or expected to be settled within 12 months
after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for

Note 17. Borrowings

Accounting policy
Borrowings, consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), are recognised initially at fair value, net
of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest
expense using the effective interest method over the term of the borrowing. Fees paid on the
establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred and
treated as a transaction cost when the draw-down occurs. The Group presents the impact of
transaction costs as part of financing cash flows.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless, at the end of the reporting period, the Group
has a right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.
Covenants that the Group is required to comply with, on or before the end of the reporting period,
affect whether the right to defer exists at the reporting date and therefore impact the classification
of loan arrangements with covenants as current or non-current. Covenants that the Group is
required to comply with after the reporting period do not affect the classification.

Revolving credit facility (RCF)
In the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group terminated its previous secured Revolving Credit Facility
and entered into a new, unsecured, multi-currency revolving facility for £330.0m offered by a
syndicate of six lenders, namely: HSBC Innovation Banking Limited, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.
London Branch, National Westminster Bank Plc, Citibank N.A., London Branch, Barclays Bank PLC and

53

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC. The maturity date of the facility is December 2027, and the
agreement offers two, one-year, extension options.
The facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to SONIA plus a margin determined by reference
to adjusted leverage (calculated as a ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA). The agreement contains
certain customary covenants, including to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio not in excess
of 3:1 and interest cover (calculated as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to finance charges in accordance
with the terms of the agreement) not less than a ratio of 3.5:1 in respect of any relevant period.
The Group monitors compliance with the covenants throughout the reporting period and has complied
with all financial covenants for this and all reporting periods. The undrawn available committed funds
as at 31 March 2025 were £230.0m (2024: £200.0m).
Credit ratings
The Group obtained independent credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Global (S&P) and Fitch Ratings
that were published on 3 April 2025. These ratings assess the creditworthiness of the Group, its
subsidiaries and branches, and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial
attributes including capital strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, strategy and governance.

Note 18. Lease liabilities
Accounting policy
Where the Group is the lessee, the right-of-use assets are recorded within the ‘Property, plant and
equipment’ line in the statement of financial position and are measured at an amount equal to the
lease liability. These relate to office spaces leased in various locations and are depreciated on a
straight-line basis with the charge recognised in administrative expenses. The liability, recognised
as part of the lease liabilities, is measured at a discounted value and any interest is charged to
finance charges. The Group presents the payments of principal and interest on lease liabilities as
part of financing cash flows.
The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases (leases with a
lease term of 12 months or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.

54

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

Low-value assets comprise IT and office equipment with a purchase price under £5,000. Payments
associated with short-term and low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an
expense in profit or loss.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of office space leases across the
Group to maximise operational flexibility and they are exercisable only by the Group and not by the
lessors. The Group assesses at the lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to
exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise
the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.

5 June 2025

As at 31 March 2025, the lease liabilities are £86.2m (2024: £21.5m) and relate to the expected terms
remaining on multiple office space leases that the Group uses for its operations, discounted at
between 2.2% and 14.0%. The leases expire between 2025-2035.
The significant increase in lease liabilities is due to the Group entering into new long term leases in
several locations during the year. As a result of this increase, lease liabilities have now been
presented separately from borrowings due to their materiality and to provide more relevant
information to users of the financial statements.
The total expense, relating to short-term leases to which the lessee recognition and measurement
requirement has not been applied, for the year ended 31 March 2025 is £1.4m (2024: £1.0m).
The Group has extension options in office leases, which have not been exercised as at 31 March
2025. The potential future lease payments, should the Group exercise the extension options, would
result in an increase in the lease liability of £4.8m.
The Group has termination options in multiple office leases, one of which management is certain as at
31 March 2025 that the termination option will be exercised. The potential future lease payments,
should the Group not exercise this termination option, would result in an increase in the lease liability
by £0.7m.

Note 19. Financial instruments and risk management
Accounting policy
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets, at initial recognition, and subsequently measures them at:
●​ amortised cost;
●​ fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and
●​ fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flows and the Group’s business model for managing them. The Group’s business
model for managing financial assets refers to how they are used in order to generate cash flows.
The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash
flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Cash flows in relation to purchase or sale of these
instruments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.
Financial assets at amortised cost
The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are
met:
●​ the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash
flows; and
●​ the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method
and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset

56

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

is derecognised, modified or impaired. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are
predominantly trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
The Group classifies debt securities (e.g. bonds) as FVOCI, as the contractual cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest, and the objective of the Group’s business model is achieved
both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
Financial assets through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss when they do not meet the criteria
to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, as described
above. This includes debt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVOCI
criteria and all derivative financial assets. Interest earned on assets mandatorily required to be
measured at FVTPL is recorded using the contractual interest rate.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises impairment loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECLs') on financial
assets that are measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The
ECL assessment considers both the 12-month and the lifetime ECL, as per IFRS 9 requirements.
The Group considers that the below elements have low credit risk based on the credit quality of the
counterparties:
a. cash and cash equivalents;
b. debt instruments held at FVOCI;
c. collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties; and
d. receivables from payment processors, partners and brokers.
ECLs on these instruments are measured on a 12-month basis; nevertheless, when there has been
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the allowance will be based on the
lifetime ECL. At every reporting date, the Group evaluates whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk since initial recognition using all reasonable and supportable information that
is available without undue cost or effort. The Group uses external credit ratings if available both to
determine whether the financial instrument has significantly increased in credit risk and to estimate
the ECLs. If a bank or other counterparty has no external credit rating, the Group evaluates its
credit quality, where necessary, by analysing its financial position, past experience, and other
factors.
The Group’s policy only allows exposures to banks and counterparties with sound credit quality and
limits the exposures to a maximum amount, considering their level of risk. Furthermore, as per the
Group’s investment policy, the debt instruments held at FVOCI consist of quoted bonds and other
fixed asset securities that are graded in the top investment categories (rated A- and above) and,
therefore, are considered to be low credit risk investments.
The Group’s receivables from customers qualify for the simplified approach in calculating ECLs, as
they do not contain a significant financing component. Therefore, the Group does not track
changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. To measure the ECLs, receivables from customers have been grouped based on
shared credit risk characteristics and number of days past due.
In calculating the ECL on receivables recognised for chargebacks, the Group has established a
provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking
factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. For negative customer balances, if
an active non-fraudulent account goes more than 30 days past due, according to Group policy, it is
perceived as an indication of a significant increase in credit risk and the receivable is provided in

full.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for derivative liabilities, which are
classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal
derivative instruments used by the Group are foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards
and non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards. Such derivative financial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting date.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is determined by mark-to market valuation
technique. The key inputs in the valuation model are the observable foreign exchange rates for the
currencies involved. These inputs are considered level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as they are
observable, but may not be quoted directly for the specific instruments.
​
​
​
​
​
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to the main financial risks: liquidity, credit, and
market risk from its use of financial instruments. The Group’s financial risk management programme
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. All financial risks
are managed against a control framework and risk appetite, which include defined metrics and limits.
The treasury function is responsible for ongoing management. The risk management function
provides close oversight by monitoring exposures, proposing metrics, methodologies and
assumptions, setting limits and early warning indicators, and performing stress testing.
​
​
​
a.​ Liquidity risk
​
​
​
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient
cash to meet operational needs.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it always has enough liquid
resources in excess of its liquidity risk appetite to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
stressed conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s position.
On the top of adhering to its internal liquidity risk management framework and risk appetite, the
Group follows and adheres to the overall financial adequacy rule (OFAR) requirements pursuant to the
guidance of MIFIDPRU 7. At 31 March 2025:
●​ the Group maintained healthy liquidity buffers above both the FCA liquid assets threshold
requirement as well as all minimum regulatory requirements across all Wise regulated entities
●​ the Group maintained healthy liquidity buffers above its internal risk appetite, supporting the
Group’s ability to withstand a range of severe, but plausible, market-wide and Wise-specific
stresses defined within the Group’s Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment and approved by
the Group's board.

In May 2024, the Group entered into Safeguarding Insurance Guarantees with 9 insurance companies
to guarantee £520.0m of customer funds, so that this amount does not need to be safeguarded and
can be used for operating customer liquidity. These arrangements have an 18 month term and include
specific renewal provisions which can be triggered 6 months before the end of the term, in order to
provide certainty on renewal at least 3 months before the end of the term. Also the Group’s Revolving
Credit Facility was refinanced in December 2024 as an unsecured 3 year £330.0m facility, with the
option to extend for 2 additional years. At 31 March 2025 £100.0m of the facility had been drawn
down with a further £230.0m available.
Despite the Group’s use of external funding options for liquidity management, the impact of
refinancing risk on the Group’s liquidity adequacy is low due to the Group’s limited reliance on the
external funding and high level of internal liquidity.
The breakdowns of trade payables, borrowings and leases into current and non-current are shown in
notes 16, 17 and 18. See also note 19 (e) for the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based
on contractual undiscounted payments.
b.​ Credit risk​

​

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The credit risk exposures are managed against
internal metrics and limits. Wise actively manages credit concentration risk and it is Wise’s policy to
impose credit limits in order to control the exposures (amount and period) Wise has with each
counterparty considering their level of risk. These limits are set based on the credit ratings or
perceived credit quality of each counterparty and approval must be obtained from the Credit Risk
Committee for any exceptions outside of the framework.

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of £13,982.8m net of impairment allowance of £1.2m.
Impairment of cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month expected loss basis and
reflects the short maturities of the exposures.
c.​ Market risk
Interest rate risk​
​
​
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from fixed interest rate assets and liabilities on Wise’s
balance sheet. Interest rate risk is managed against a control framework, which is defined with set
metrics and limits in place.
The Group’s economic value of equity is exposed to interest rate risk from fixed interest rate assets
and liabilities on Wise’s balance sheet. The main fixed interest rate exposure for Wise is driven by
sovereign bonds within the safeguarded assets.
The Group is also exposed, more generally, to the risk of changes in net interest income (interest
income net of benefits paid to customers) resulting from potential movements in interest rates on its
financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
A 1% instantaneous downward shock of all interest rate curves would lead to a reduction of £141.4m
in annual interest income (2024: £110.9m), based on an average FY2025 balance of £16,537.0m of
financial assets and to a reduction in net interest income, after benefits paid to customers, of £86.1m
(2024: £69.0m), based on FY2025 level of interest returned to customers. A 1% upward shock of all
interest rate curves would lead to an increase of £142.1m in annual net interest income (2024:
£112.2m) and to an increase in net interest income, after benefits paid to customers, of £86.7m (2024:
£70.4m).
Foreign exchange risk​
​
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate movement from holding assets and liabilities in
different currencies and guaranteeing Send Money customers a foreign exchange rate on their
international transfers for a short period of time. Wise actively monitors foreign exchange risk, and
exposures are managed through a combination of natural hedging and treasury hedging products.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards and
non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk:

the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date. They do not represent
amounts at risk. Since the balance sheet date all open treasury positions have been realised or

The table below presents the Group’s net position (difference between financial assets and liabilities)
across its main currencies at the end of each reporting period. This table does not include the final

settlement amounts of any open derivative positions, as these are only accounted for upon cash
settlement on the balance sheet. Hence the accounting exposures below, as at 31 March 2025, are

Foreign exchange fluctuations sensitivity analysis
Foreign exchange risk is monitored on an ongoing basis using a value at risk (VaR) and stressed value
at risk (SVaR) approach, considering the foreign exchange risk arising from open non GBP currency
positions as FX rates move adversely against our open positions. For the sensitivity analysis, a severe
stress was applied to our 31 March 2025 positions, which assumes that both EUR and USD would
depreciate 5% simultaneously. In this scenario, a loss of £3.2m would arise over one day (2024:
£1.4m).
d.​ Capital risk ​ ​
​
​
​
​
Capital risk is the risk that the Group and its individual entities have an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support their normal business activities and to meet their regulatory capital
requirements, both under normal operating environments and stressed conditions.
The Group’s eligible capital comprises ordinary share capital, share based payments reserve, other
reserves and audited retained earnings, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in
equity, less certain deductions (including deferred tax and intangibles).​
​
​
​
​
The Group’s objectives when managing capital risk are to:​ ​
​
​
​
​
●​ adhere to regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction;
●​ safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that the Group can continue
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;
●​ fund an orderly wind-down in a reverse stress scenario (an extreme, but still plausible,
combination of events or circumstances that would lead to that catastrophic failure which
won't allow the Group to continue operating); and
●​ maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. ​
The Group is subject to prudential regulatory consolidation which follows the rules in the sourcebook
for MIFID investment firms (‘MIFIDPRU’). This is the case due to the existence of Wise Assets UK Ltd,
a group UK FCA-regulated investment firm subject to the same rules.
Both Wise Assets UK Ltd (MIFID investment firm) and the Group (MIFID investment group) are
classified as Non-small and Non-interconnected investment firms (‘non-SNI’).
The Group also follows and adheres to the Overall Own Funds Threshold Requirement as this is
derived by the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment (‘ICARA’) and approved by the Group

63

board. ICARA is a continuous risk assessment process which considers the business model
implication on capital and liquidity on an ongoing basis pursuant to the guidance of MIFIDPRU 7.
At 31 March 2025 the Group maintained healthy buffers above both the Group Overall Own Funds
Requirement as well as all minimum regulatory capital requirements across all Wise regulated entities.
Further information on the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital, along with the
disclosure requirements under MIFIDPRU 8, can be found on our Owner relations website:

Fair value hierarchy​ ​

​

Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified
into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair
values.
●​ Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted
market prices at the end of the reporting period. Products classified as level 1 predominantly
comprise treasury bonds, investment grade corporate paper and money market funds. The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current close price at
the balance sheet date.​
●​ Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is
determined using valuation techniques with the inputs that are observable either directly or
indirectly. The Group classifies derivative financial assets and liabilities as level 2 financial
instruments. These instruments are valued by observable foreign exchange rates. There were
no changes to the valuation technique during the period.
●​ Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the
instrument is included in level 3. The Group does not currently have any financial instruments
in level 3.

Note 20. Provisions
Accounting policy
Provisions are liabilities where the exact timing and amount of the obligation are uncertain.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of past events, when an outflow of resources is probable to settle the obligation and when an
amount can be reliably estimated.The carrying amounts of provisions are reviewed at each balance
sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

related to share options granted to Non-Executive Directors of Wise under the Company’s legacy
incentive plans prior to the Company’s admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange (2024:
100,000 Class A Ordinary Shares).
During the year, the Company redeemed 155,305,559 Class B Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of
£0.000 000 001 in accordance with Article 15.3.2 of the Company’s Articles of Association (2024: nil).
Each Class A Ordinary shareholder is entitled to one vote for each Class A Ordinary Share held,
subject to any restrictions on total voting rights as set out in the Company's Articles of Association.
Class A Ordinary shareholders are entitled to interim or annual dividends to the extent declared and
do not hold any preferential rights to dividends. Class A Ordinary Shares are non-redeemable.
Each Class B shareholder is entitled to nine votes for each Class B Share held, subject to any
restrictions on total voting rights as set out in the Company's Articles of Association. Class B Shares
carry no rights to distributions of dividends except on distribution of assets, up to their nominal value,
on a liquidation or winding up. Class B Shares are strictly non-transferable, non-tradable and
non-distributable to any person or entity whatsoever.

Note 22. Own share reserve
Accounting policy
Own share reserve
Own share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares of Wise plc that are held by the
employee share trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share
plans. Own shares are treated as a deduction from equity, and on exercising of employee awards,
are transferred from own shares to retained earnings at their weighted average cost.
Employee share trust
The Group provides financing to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either
purchase the Company’s shares on the open market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital,
to meet the Group’s obligation to provide shares when employees exercise their options or awards.

68

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2025
5 June 2025

Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the consolidated income statement. The Group
consolidates this share trust.
Shares held by the ESOP Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares
until such time that employees exercise their awards. The consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), on purchase of Company’s equity instruments
is deducted from equity.
Purchase of own shares
During the financial year, Wise continued the programme, which commenced in 2023, to purchase
Wise shares in the market through the Trust in order to reduce the impact of dilution from
stock-based compensation. As of 31 March 2025, a total of 8,704,883 shares (31 March 2024:
9,071,706) were purchased from the market at an average of £8.21 per share (2024: £7.56).
Directly attributable costs of £0.5m (2024: £0.5m) have been charged to equity.

Note 23. Share-based employee compensation
Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of employee equity-settled schemes as part of its reward strategy,
which are designed to provide long-term incentives for all employees to deliver long-term
shareholder returns. Under the plans, participants are granted share awards of the Company, which
vest gradually over the vesting period and are equity-settled for shares within Wise plc. The
maximum term of share awards granted is 10 years.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted
and it is calculated using the closing share price at the grant date. It is recognised in employee
benefit expenses together with a corresponding increase in equity (share-based payment reserve),
over the period in which the service and the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting
period). Upon exercise of share options, the impact is recognised in retained earnings.
For non-market-based awards, vesting conditions are included in the assumptions of the number of
options and awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the entity revises its
estimates of the number of options and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact
of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income, with a
corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve. For awards subject to a
market-based performance condition, no subsequent adjustments may be made.
Employee share award plans
The awards are subject to service conditions, i.e. the requirement for recipients of awards to
remain in employment with the Group over the vesting period, which typically is 4 years.
Market-based awards
For market-based awards, the vesting is conditional on achievement of the relative total
shareholder return (TSR) compared to the FTSE 250 and volume growth performance measures
over the 3-year performance period.

Note 27. Post balance sheet events ​
The Board has concluded its review of the Group’s listing arrangements and, having assessed in detail
the optimal listing and structure, the Group intends to transfer its primary listing from the equity
shares (transition) category on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) to a US stock exchange, and to
maintain a secondary listing on the LSE. This would allow the Group’s shares to trade on both a US
stock exchange and the LSE.
No other material post balance sheet events have been identified.

Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting.
These measures are not defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable with the
APMs of other companies.
The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing
alternative interpretations of the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed and
they are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis and reporting. These APMs
should be viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute for, measures presented in the financial
statements which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

measure of underlying performance and growth that is not
inflated by the excess interest income that we will look to pass
back to our customers
