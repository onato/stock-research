Q4 FY24 Trading Update
16 April 2024

Customer growth remains strong with income exceeding expectations
Customers love the Wise proposition, resulting in more people and businesses joining us and
using multiple features…
●

Active customers grew 29% YoY to 7.9 million in Q4 FY24, with the number of personal
customers increasing 30% YoY to 7.5 million, and business customers increasing 16% YoY to
395k.

●

An increasing number of customers are using multiple features with 48% of personal
customers and 60% of businesses using Wise for more than just sending money across
borders - including spending abroad with their Wise card, earning a return with Assets or
using local account details.

With more customers using Wise to move and manage their money, and with the benefit of higher
interest rates, income grew 36% YoY to £381.2m in Q4 FY24
●

Revenue grew by 24% YoY to £277.2m in Q4 FY24.
○

Cross-border revenue: We moved £30.6bn of cross-border volume for our customers
in the quarter, 14% more than the same period last year. Continuing strong growth in
the smaller (<£10k) personal volume per customer (VPC) segment led to a reduction of
5% QoQ in the overall VPC, reflecting the popularity of the Wise account and smaller
transaction sizes on the Wise card. The cross-border take rate was maintained at 67
bps.

○

Other revenue: The proportion of revenue from other services grew to 26% in Q4
FY24 (25% in Q3 FY24) as customers used more features, especially the Wise card
which represents the majority of this ‘other revenue’.

●

Interest income net of customer benefits grew by 86% YoY to £104m in Q4 FY24.
○

Customers are holding more of their money with Wise, with Wise account balances
increasing 24% YoY to £13.3bn. The gross yield received while safeguarding these
balances was 4.4% in Q4 FY24 (vs 2.8% in Q4 FY23).

○

Interest income net of customer benefits continues to be inflated.

FY24 income growth ahead of expectations and contributing to an exceptional level of profitability
●

For FY24, the growth in customers using Wise combined with the higher rate environment
drove income growth of 46%, higher than our expectation of 42-44%

●

With an elevated level of interest income being retained, and lower levels of transactional
costs, our gross profit margin is expected to be higher in H2 FY24 than the 74% in H1 FY24.
As a consequence, Adjusted EBITDA margins also remain exceptionally elevated relative to our
medium-term guidance of at or above 20%.

I am pleased that we have ended the financial year with another solid quarter. Active customer
growth remained strong at 29% as personal and business customers find our growing set of features
and products increasingly useful in helping to move and manage their money.
This quarter, we resumed business customer onboarding across the vast majority of Europe, and we
continued to invest in our infrastructure and broaden our offering across the world. In Asia alone, we
became one of the first international financial services companies to be granted a Type 1 Funds
Provider licence in Japan, while adding Standard Chartered's Mox as a new Wise Platform banking
partner in Hong Kong, and expanding our partnership with Tiger Brokers in Singapore by facilitating
card issuance.
Our continued customer growth laps strong results and tells us that the investments that we’re
making are meeting real needs, giving me confidence that we’re progressing well on our mission.
