Wise plc
Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
"2024 was another strong year of growth for Wise. We moved £118.5bn around the world for
12.8m customers, 29% more customers than last year, with much of this growth driven by the
popularity of the Wise account. This led to a 31% growth in underlying income1 to £1.2bn with an
underlying profit before tax of £242m (up 226%). We are investing in infrastructure and customer
experiences to serve as much of this huge, under-served cross-border payments market as
possible, including starting FY25 by reducing fees further for our customers."

Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer
Highlights for the twelve months ended 31 March 2024
Growth driven by 13 years of investment into our vision of money without borders
● 12.8m active customers served in FY24 (+29% YoY), moving £118.5bn (+13% YoY) across
borders, with growth across segments and regions.
● More customers than ever have adopted multiple features with their Wise account; 48% of
personal and 60% of business customers - holding more than £16bn (+44% YoY) through the
account (cash and Assets), with usage growing rapidly.
Growing fast and increasingly profitable
● Customer growth, account adoption and higher interest rates drove underlying income up
+31% YoY to £1.2bn (Revenue £1.1bn). After accounting for costs and reinvestment, we
generated £242m of underlying profit before tax (+226% YoY), equivalent to an underlying
profit before tax margin of 21%.
● Reported profit before tax rose to £481m (+229%) with basic earnings per share of 34.2p.
Investments made in FY24 will contribute to future growth
● We continue to enhance our infrastructure: connecting to the Australian domestic payment
system (NPP) increasing our direct connections to 5; achieving a tier 1 licence in Japan
removing the ¥1m transfer limit; and collaborating with Swift to make it easier for banks and
their customers to use Wise.
● Operational efficiencies achieved in FY24 enabled a reduction in cross-border pricing of
more than 2bps (effective from Q1 FY25), while 62% of payments are now instant.
● Wise Assets ‘Interest’ launched in 5 more European countries, allowing more customers to
earn an interest-like return by holding their money in government guaranteed assets.
● We made it easier to receive money around the world, including introducing Wise Invoicing
for business customers.
Investing relentlessly to serve as much of this huge, under-served market as possible
● We will continue to invest in the substantial opportunity that exists for Wise.
● Over the medium term we expect to operate to an underlying profit before tax margin of
13-16% (equivalent to an underlying adjusted EBITDA margin of 20-23%); sustainably
reinvesting into the flywheel of growth, while generating the capital needed to support a
fast-growing global financial services business.
● Driven by customer growth, we expect underlying income growth of 15-20% CAGR over the
medium term from FY24. FY25 underlying income growth over FY24 expected to be between
15-20% (20-25% when adjusting for outperformance in FY24 which led to price reductions at
the start of FY25).

Underlying income is an alternative performance measure comprising revenue, first 1% of gross yield of interest income
on customer balances, and any interest expense on customer balances. It does not include interest income above the first
1% gross yield or benefits paid on customer balances.

An update from Kristo, our Co-founder and CEO
We’re building the best way to move and manage the world’s money, making Wise increasingly
useful and valuable to people and businesses globally
At Wise, we’re solving a massive problem for people and businesses. It is estimated that people
around the world move £2 trillion worth of money across borders each year, while businesses
move an additional £9 trillion.
Most of this money moves on a slow, expensive, inconvenient and opaque legacy financial
system. We’re fundamentally changing this. Making it faster and easier to move money around
the world, at a much lower and more transparent price. We’ve done this by building an alternative
infrastructure and network for cross-border transactions.
In 2011, we started by building the infrastructure needed to send money from one country to
another. Guided by our customers' feedback, we’ve built more products they need and love.
Today, with their Wise accounts, people and businesses can send, spend and hold money in over
40 currencies, receive money using domestic account details, and use a debit card to spend like
a local. And via Wise Platform, we’re also able to offer people and businesses this same Wise
experience through their local bank.
This customer-led approach is driving our growth. 12.8m customers used Wise to move money
across borders in FY2024, 29% more than last year. Driven by customer growth, account
adoption, and higher interest rates, we have seen underlying income grow by a CAGR of 41% and
underlying profit before tax by a CAGR of 83% over the last three years.
We continue to grow quickly but sustainably. We remain well-controlled; reinvesting and
generating a growing level of profitability.
Infrastructure that sets us apart
Our products and services are powered by our unique and increasingly powerful infrastructure as
a replacement to the traditional correspondent system. We do this by connecting directly to local
payment systems, and working with 90+ banking and payment partners around the world to
ensure our service is effective and always available.
This network is connected in real time through our proprietary technology and global operations,
as we operate under our 65+ regulatory licences around the world. We moved over £118bn
across borders through this network last year.
We continue to invest in the network. This year we completed our integration with the New
Payments Platform in Australia 一 meaning we are now directly connected to a total of 5 domestic
payment systems globally.
We also continue to deepen our global licensing footprint. This year we completed a rigorous
multi-year process to obtain a Type 1 Funds Transfer Service Provider licence in Japan. We are
one of the first international financial services companies operating in the country to be granted

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

this kind of licence, removing the 1 million yen limit on individual transfers we were subject to
under the previous licence.
Operationally, we serve our customers at speed, with greatest convenience and, critically, with
controls in place to protect both them and us from financial crime. This includes the design of our
products, the checks completed when onboarding new customers and the continuous real-time
monitoring of all transactions using machine learning to support the team.
The components of our infrastructure combine to enable a service which is reliable, fast (with
more than 62% of transfers completed instantly in Q4 FY2024), and low cost (at an average price
of 0.67% in FY2024).
Delivering products and features our customers love
We serve our customers with cross-border transfers and other services through three products:
the Wise Account for personal customers, Wise Business for small and medium-sized businesses
and Wise Platform for banks and other enterprises.
In FY2024 we continued to expand our products’ availability. This includes launching a service for
expats in China to send money home, removing charges for holding balances in Australia,
enabling businesses in Brazil to receive up to 10,000 USD from Wise customers and increasing
limits on transfers to Indonesia to 2bn IDR.
We rolled out Wise Assets ‘Interest’ into 5 European countries in FY2024, allowing more
customers to earn an interest-like return on their euro (EUR) and sterling (GBP) balances via
investments in low-risk funds backed by government assets. Wise Assets ‘Stocks’ launched in 11
European countries, letting customers hold their balances as ownership in the world’s largest
public companies.
We continued to increase functionality too. With the launch of WiseTag (a unique link or QR code)
customers can now easily receive or request money from other Wise users without needing a
mobile number or account details. We took it a step further for business customers, who got
access to Wise Invoicing which makes it easier for businesses to receive money in more than 9
currencies.
Wise Platform enables banks, other financial institutions and enterprises to bring the benefits of
the Wise infrastructure to their customers conveniently through their own existing apps and
accounts. In FY2024 Wise Platform continued to grow cross-border volumes in line with the rest
of the business as we added more partners including Mox, Agoda, and Webexpenses, bringing
the total to more than 85. We began to expand the features we provide to Platform partners too,
for example providing Wise-issued cards to Tiger Brokers customers in Singapore and Parpera’s
in Australia.
Championing price transparency
Recent regulatory changes in the EU and warnings from the US consumer protection body, the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to operators in the US are a big step forward
towards bringing price transparency to life for consumers and businesses around the world.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

These changes are recognition of the value that clear and honest communication has for
customers.
We believe that transparency should be non-negotiable. People and businesses should be clearly
told upfront what a service is going to cost them so they can make a well-informed decision,
rather than being tricked by ‘fee-free’ marketing or inflated exchange rates to disguise the real
fees. That’s why we always show customers a clear breakdown of what they will pay with Wise
and why we have a fee comparison table on our homepage.
It’s good to see more policymakers agree with us. We expect price transparency to become a
basic expectation over time from customers and regulators. Over that time we will continue to
build a great, transparent service for customers, available at the lowest cost.
Investment in growth is paying off
Investing in our growth is continuous and over the last 3 years to FY2024 we’ve been able to
demonstrate the value of these investments with active customers growing by a 29% CAGR,
cross-border volumes by 30% CAGR to £118.5 billion, and customer balances rose by a 53%
CAGR to £13.3 billion.
The growing level of adoption, a growing customer base, and higher central bank rates were the
drivers behind a 31% growth in underlying income to £1,172.7 million in FY2024 over FY2023.
After spending what is required to provide our services, we reinvest back into the growth of the
business through marketing, better service, more products and infrastructure, and lower prices.
All of which contributes to customer growth over time.
After accounting for these costs and reinvestments, we generated £241.8 million pounds of
underlying profit before tax in FY2024. This represented a 226% increase over FY2023 and an
underlying PBT margin of 21% in FY2024. Reported profit before tax increased significantly to
£481.4 million and basic earnings per share to 34.2 pence, an increase of more than x3 over
FY2023 for each.
Onwards
I’m really pleased that we were able to help 12.8 million customers move money across borders in
FY2024, but that equates to less than 5% of the people who have such a need and less than 1%
of businesses. We have come a long way from our first customer and already shifted people’s
expectations to money without borders, but we’re still in the beginning of our mission. We will
keep focusing on the things that make our customers evangelical about Wise, we’ll continue to
scale a company which creates massive value for customers and owners alike over the
long-term. The best is yet to come.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

A financial update from Kingsley, our interim CFO
We’re serving more people and businesses with more products and features, making Wise
increasingly valuable for all.
FY2024 was another year of strong customer-led growth and progress for Wise. We continued
investing in building the products and features that customers need to move and manage their
money around the world. This is working. Over 12.8 million customers used Wise for cross-border
transactions in FY2024 and a growing number of customers are using us for much more. This has
resulted in higher levels of profitability and growth across a broad base of geographies,
customers and products.
Basis of presentation
For FY2024, we made the decision to change the way we present our financial information. As
part of our commitment to transparency in everything we do, we believe these changes will
provide a better representation of our underlying financial performance, as well as a clearer
presentation of Wise’s core business performance and longer term growth trajectory.
This change of reporting consists of:
-

A presentation of and focus on “underlying” financial performance, which excludes net
interest income above the first 1% gross interest yield.
The lead earnings metric in our reporting will be “underlying profit before tax”. To date
the lead earnings metric has been “Adjusted EBITDA”.
From underlying profit before tax, we will then report the adjustment needed to reconcile
to our reported profit before tax. This consists of:
- Interest income above the first 1% yield; less
- Benefits paid relating to customer balances.

More customers, more growth
In FY2024 active customers grew by 29% to 12.8 million, with 5.4 million new customers joining
Wise and completing their first cross-border transaction. This growth in customers drove a 13%
growth in cross-border volumes to £118.5 billion (16% growth on a constant currency basis), with
double-digit growth across all five of our geographical segments (Europe, United Kingdom, North
America, Asia Pacific, and the rest of the world).
Active Personal customers grew 29% to 12.2 million, with Personal volumes growing by 14% to
£87.2 billion. At the end of FY2024, with an adoption rate of 48%, almost half of all Personal
customers are now using the Wise Account.
The roll-out and popularity of the Wise Account is driving strong growth in the smaller (<£10k per
quarter) Personal volume per customer (VPC) segment. In particular, when a Wise Account
customer only uses their card for cross-border activity in a quarter (‘card-only’, as opposed to
completing transfers), they typically have a cross-border VPC of £500 to £1,000, and the
proportion of these ‘card-only’ customers in a given quarter is growing fast.
In Q1 FY2021 the proportion of active personal customers who were ‘card-only’ in this way was c.
3%, compared to our most recent quarter, Q4 FY2024, when this had risen to 17%.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

The Personal segment VPC in Q4 FY2024 was c£3,000, which was down 11% compared to Q4
FY2023. Excluding these fast growing, lower-VPC ‘card-only’ customers, Personal VPC would be
c.15% higher than reported in Q4 FY2024 and would have decreased by c. 6% compared to Q4
FY2023. Approximately half of this reduction is explained by translation into GBP and the other
half mainly by the slower pace of growth among higher VPC customers (e.g. >£10k per quarter)
since interest rates began to rise.
Active Business customers increased by 20% to 0.63 million, with 60% having adopted the
account and with Business volumes increasing by 12% to £31.3 billion. The onboarding of new
business customers in the second half of FY2024 was slower compared to the first half as we
temporarily paused onboarding in the UK and EU due to operational capacity constraints at a
time of high demand. We re-opened on a phased basis across countries, with some initially
applying refined criteria to prioritise higher quality applications. Entering FY2025, we had
resumed business customer onboarding across all major markets.
In total, cross-border revenue grew by 17% to £795.2m, driven by the growth in customers and
volumes in addition to a 2bps higher cross take rate of 0.67%.
Rising adoption of the account resulted in ‘Card and other revenue’ growing by 54% to £256.8m.
Underlying interest income rose by 2.4x to £120.7m, due to a 24% growth in customer balances
to £13.3 billion combined with higher interest income yields as rates began to rise mid-way
through FY2023.
Underlying income, which consists of cross-border revenue, card and other revenue, and
underlying interest income, increased 31% to £1,172.7 million (Revenue £1,052.0 million, up 24%
over FY2023). This includes Personal and Business segments growing 30% and 37% respectively.
When we look at our different regions, we see all regions growing at pace.
The appeal of the Wise Account has driven customer growth and the value of these customers is
noticeable. Within a quarter, Personal Wise account customers generate on average c25% more
underlying income than Personal customers who only complete cross-border transfers. For Wise
Business account customers it’s even higher at c100%. Account customers tend to be more
active over time with longer lives too.
Underlying gross profit grew 51%, creating capacity to reinvest back into growth
Cost of sales and net credit losses reduced by 2% to £319.9 million in FY2024. The
implementation of enhanced controls reduced the levels of account-related costs such as
chargebacks and overdrawn balances. We also continue to refine our management of FX costs
which, especially in a period of low FX volatility, resulted in significantly lower costs in FY2024.
Product losses and FX costs vary over time and we consider a year-on-year reduction in absolute
terms as an exception that is unlikely to be repeated given the growth of the business.
Rapid underlying income growth of 31% and falling cost of sales combined to drive underlying
gross profit up 51% in FY2024 to £852.8 million. This represents an underlying gross profit margin
of 73%, significantly higher than the 63% in FY2023. Reported Gross profit was £1,092.4 million,
an increase of £454.2 million (71%) on FY2023.
Gross profit provides us with the capacity to cover our operating expenses, invest in building a
better experience for our customers and deliver our target underlying profit margin. Through
reinvestment, we deepen our competitive advantage with infrastructure and products that

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

continually improve, attracting more and more customers which leads to more gross profit to
reinvest, and so the cycle continues.
Striving to reduce prices sustainably over time is an important form of investment for Wise. In
recent years we have seen more price increases than decreases as we’ve needed to cover
growing investments in our operational capabilities and have seen certain other costs fluctuate,
such as FX and product losses. Entering FY2025 we were pleased to reduce cross-border prices
by over 2 basis points, sustainably reinvesting gross profit margin into lower prices - the most
common reason customers choose to join Wise.
Administrative expenses for the year increased by 25% to £615.9 million. This reflects investment
into future growth as well as in the capacity required to onboard and serve a fast growing active
customer base who are increasingly using more features.
At 31 March 2024, we had over 5,500 Wisers, a more than 2,000 increase over the last two years.
The growth in our team resulted in employee benefit expenses increasing 28% to £377.3 million in
FY2024. We expect to add around 1,000 roles over the course of FY2025. These Wisers will help
us on our mission; building products, improving our infrastructure, supporting our core functions
and helping to attract and serve even more customers.
For example, investing in our servicing teams will help us better manage any rapid rises in
demand, such as we saw earlier this year. We are also continuing to grow the teams responsible
for combating financial crime, overall compliance and risk management, which remain essential in
a fast-moving and ever-changing regulatory environment.
A focus on the effectiveness of incremental marketing through FY2024 resulted in spend of
£36.5 million which was broadly flat on FY2023 and our marketing team growing by 27%, while
the number of new customers rose by approximately 20% to 5.4 million. We expect our enhanced
understanding of the incremental benefits of marketing across segments and channels to unlock
greater levels of marketing investment through FY2025. This is planned to include targeted
expansion into brand marketing in a couple of markets (with an initial campaign already launched
in Australia in Q1 FY2025), as well as greater levels of performance marketing spend.
Our economics remain healthy, as the combination of products that customers love, efficient
marketing and evangelical customers means that our marketing investments remain small relative
to the number of customers joining Wise, with the blended payback within 6 months in FY2024.
Technology costs increased by 25% to £53.5 million and expenses relating to consultancy and
outsourced services increased by 28% to £90.4 million, both reflecting the greater services
required to support the growth of the business.
We remain highly profitable and well capitalised
In FY2024 we generated an underlying profit before tax of £241.8 million, a 226% increase over
FY2023 with a margin that was high at 21%.
To then arrive at our reported IFRS profit before tax, our ‘interest income above the first 1% yield’
of £364.5 million, less the value of ‘benefits paid relating to customer balances’ of £124.9 million,
is added to the underlying profit before tax.
As per our interest income framework, of this £364.5 million of interest income, it is intended for
20% (£72.9 million) to be retained while aiming to return the remaining 80% (£291.6 million in

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

FY2024) to customers. We partly achieved this with £124.9 million being paid to customers in the
year, leaving £166.7 million being incidentally retained, the majority of which relates to the UK
where we are currently unable to pay interest to Wise Account holders under the terms of our
licence.
Reported profit before tax increased significantly to £481.4 million and earnings per share to 34.2
pence, a 2x increase over FY2023 for each.
As at 31 March 2024, we held £14.5 billion of cash and highly liquid investment grade assets, up
26% from £11.5 billion at the end of FY2023. This includes assets in respect of the £13.3 billion of
customer balances. It also includes £1.1 billion of our ‘own cash’ (£0.7 billion at the end of
FY2023), with the increase driven by the £486.6 million of reported free cash flow generated by
the business (see definition in appendix). On this basis, our reported free cash flow conversion
rate for FY2024 was 101% of reported profit before tax (107% in FY2023, based on comparison to
reported profit before tax, rather than Adjusted EBITDA as previously).
We are well capitalised for the future and as at 31 March 2024, our Group eligible capital was
£870.4 million, including the now audited FY24 profits, significantly above our minimum
regulatory capital requirements.
Our capital position, built through sustained profitability, enabled us to initiate a programme in
FY2023 to reduce the dilutive impact on share count that arises through stock based
compensation. £10 million of our capital was used in FY2023 by our Employee Benefit Trust to
fund such share purchases and this rose to £69.9 million in FY2024, covering the impact of new
grants issued during the year. We intend to continue this programme into FY2025, purchasing
shares to cover new grants at a broadly similar level to FY2024.
Looking beyond the short term with a relentless focus on the long term opportunity
We have grown quickly, doubling the active customers we serve over just three years, but the
opportunity for Wise remains substantial; many millions of people and small businesses move
trillions of pounds across-borders while over-paying for a poor service.
To further unlock this opportunity we will continue to invest into our long term growth potential.
We fundamentally believe that the market leader over time will be the provider of the cheapest,
fastest and most convenient service, with the broadest coverage. This can only be achieved
through building the best global infrastructure while driving growth through relentlessly pursuing
incremental improvements in price, speed and convenience.
We plan to continue reinvesting back into our growth each year over the medium term while
organically generating the capital needed for a fast growing global financial services business.
We therefore expect to operate at an underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16% over the
medium term, equivalent to targeting an underlying adjusted EBITDA margin of 20-23%.
We expect our reported profit before tax to continue to be higher than underlying profit before
tax as long as the effective interest rate we achieve on customer balances is greater than 1%.
Under our framework, 20% of any interest above the first 1% yield will be retained and added to
profit before tax (£72.9 million in FY2024).
The other 80% will be returned to customers where possible. In FY2024, 35 percentage points
(ppts) of the 80ppts were paid to customers. We were unable to return the other 45ppts for

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

several reasons including where the deposits are in jurisdictions where we’re unable to pay
interest for regulatory reasons (eg the UK, c30ppts), where we do not yet pay interest on all
currencies, and in some geographies such as the US where customers are required to ‘opt-in’ to
receiving interest but have not yet done so. Where customers do not currently receive interest on
their balance, our priority is to launch and promote our Assets Interest product, which provides a
market rate of interest, while still providing all of the other benefits of the Wise Account. This
option is currently available for UK, EU and Singapore customers.
Over the medium term, we expect our investments to drive a continuing high level of customer
growth, resulting in a 15%-20% CAGR growth in underlying income from a FY2024 base.
Underlying income growth in FY2025 is also expected to be within this range of 15-20%.
Improvements in efficiency were gained in FY2024 resulting in an inflated level of earnings and
providing the opportunity to reduce our average cross-border pricing by more than 2 basis
points, which was effective from early in Q1 FY2025. Adjusting for the connected nature of this
outperformance in FY2024 and price reduction in FY2025, our expected growth would have
otherwise been 20-25% in FY2025.
We have also initiated a second re-price in Q1 FY2025, off the back of a significant improvement
in our cost allocation methodology, in order to ensure customers only pay in proportion to the
costs we incur in providing the specific service. This is intended to be broadly revenue neutral
overall, but will lead to price reductions for higher value transactions, particularly on main
currency routes.
Growing fast and increasingly profitable
We have built a business with world-class fundamentals, and our rapid growth and increasing
profitability is a testament to that. With continuing investment into long term growth, we are
poised to capture even more of the massive market opportunity ahead. We are delivering on our
mission and creating massive value for both our customers and shareholders.

1. The merger reserve arises from the Group pre-listing reorganisation accounted for as a capital reorganisation. Upon the reorganisation, the Group's Ordinary Shares
have been represented as those of Wise plc. The difference between Wise Payments Limited net assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the
merger reserve.
2. Other reserves predominantly relate to investments into highly liquid bonds measured at FVOCI. For these investments, changes in fair value are accumulated within the
FVOCI reserve within equity. On disposal of these debt investments, any related balance within the FVOCI reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. During the year £10.9m of
fair value gains were recognised in the other comprehensive income (2023: fair value losses of £5.5m), including £3.5m of tax credit (2023: £2.4m tax charge). Refer to
note 10 for further information on the tax recognised on bonds.

Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2024
Note 1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
1.1 General information
Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England.
The address of its registered office is 6th Floor, Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1
6JJ. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) is the provision of
cross-border and domestic financial services. Further information on the Group’s operations and
principal activities is presented in the Strategic Report.

1.2 Accounting information and policies
Introduction
This section describes the basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the
Group’s accounting policies that are applicable to the financial statements as a whole. The Group’s
material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgements specific to a note, are
included in the note to which they relate. Furthermore, the section details new accounting standards,
amendments and interpretations, that the Group has adopted in the current financial year or will
adopt in subsequent years.
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the
UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in conformity with the applicable legal requirements
of the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the
preceding financial year, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. All financial information is presented
in millions of pounds sterling (‘£’), which is the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest
£0.1m, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of particular financial instruments, to the extent
required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
(b) Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development and
position are set out in the Strategic report.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the
Group has the available resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
The going concern assessment is based on the detailed forecast prepared by management and
approved by the Board (base plan). As part of the going concern review, the Directors have

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

considered severe, but plausible, downside scenarios to stress test the viability of the business.
These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and liquidity as
well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Appropriate
assumptions have been made in respect to revenue growth and profitability, based on the economic
outlook over the forecast period. Appropriate sensitivities have been applied in order to stress test
the base plan, considering situations with lower revenue growth and profitability compared to the
base plan, where future trading is less than forecasted. Management expects that sufficient liquidity
and regulatory capital requirement headroom are maintained throughout the forecast period.
The Directors have made inquiries of management and considered forecasts for the Group and have,
at the time of approving these financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operations for the foreseeable future. Further details are contained
in the Viability Statement of the Strategic Report.
(c) Basis of consolidation
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Wise plc and its
subsidiaries as at 31 March 2024.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies
within the Group are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Group accounting policies
are consistently applied to all entities and transactions.
(d) Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current or
non-current classification.
An asset is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
●
●
●
●

expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;
held primarily for the purpose of trading;
expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period;
cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for
at least twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

●
●
●
●

it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;
it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period;
there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months
after the reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified
as non-current assets and liabilities.
(e) Foreign currencies translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Items included in the
financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective
functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction is recognised.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange
rates are recognised in profit or loss (either as cost of sales or administrative expenses).
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates if held at historical
cost, or year-end exchange rates if held at fair value, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or
losses are recognised in either the income statement or shareholders’ equity depending on the
treatment of the gain or loss on the asset or liability.
Group companies
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the
currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are translated into pounds sterling as follows:
●
●
●

assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing exchange
rate at the reporting date;
income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates; and
all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

(h) Changes in material accounting policies and disclosures
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the Group from 1
April 2023:
a. Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies
Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they
impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements. The amendments
require the disclosure of ‘material’, rather than ‘significant’, accounting policies. Management reviewed

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

the accounting policies and made updates to the information disclosed in the annual report in line
with the amendments.
b. Amendments to IAS 12- International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules
Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the
Group operates. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax
accounting for the impacts of the top-up taxes and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.
The Group has performed an initial assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.
This assessment is based on the most recent information available regarding the financial
performance of the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the initial assessment performed, the
Group does not expect any material top up taxes. The Group is continuing to monitor potential future
implications.
c.
●
●
●

Other amendments:
IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts
Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Policies
Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single
Transaction

The adoption of the other amendments did not have a material impact on the Group. There are no
other new or revised standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial
year beginning on or after 1 April 2023 that would be expected to have a material impact on the
Group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
The following amendments have been published by the IASB and are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2024; the amendments have not been early-adopted by the Group:
a. Amendment to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current
Liabilities with Covenants
The amendments, as issued in 2020, aim to clarify the requirements on determining whether a liability
is current or non-current, and apply retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2024. It is anticipated that the application of those amendments may have an impact in the
Group's consolidated financial statements in future periods.
b. New standard issue - IFRS 18 Primary financial statements
The new standard will become effective, in the consolidated Group financial statements, for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 and its impact is under assessment.
c.
●
●
●
●

Other amendments:
Amendments to IFRS 16- Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier Finance Arrangements
Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeability
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale of contribution of assets between an investor and
its associate or joint venture

None of the other amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or
future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.

1.3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of critical judgments which the Directors consider could have a significant impact on these
financial statements are set out in the following notes:
●
●

Customer balances (recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the
balance sheet) - note 15 and note 16
Net gains and losses from foreign exchange differences (accounting) - note 6

Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of estimation.

Note 2. Segment information

Accounting policy
The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment.The information regularly reported to the
Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’), which is currently the Board of Directors of the Group,
for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of performance, is based wholly on the
overall activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s business model, the Group has determined
that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is provision of cross-border and
domestic financial services.
The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for the reportable segment can be determined by reference
to the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of
revenue by type of customer and geographical region is set out in note 3.
At the end of each reporting period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise
Payments Limited in the UK. Based on the location of the non-current asset, the following
geographical breakdown of non-current assets is prepared:

Note 3. Revenue

Accounting policy
The Group primarily generates revenue from money transfers, conversion services and debit card
services.
A customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time of opening a Wise Account or
initiating a money transfer. The customer agrees to the contractual terms by formally accepting the
terms and conditions of the respective service, on Wise’s website or the App. For debit card
services, a customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time the card, either virtual or
physical, is made available for use and the customer is able to either make a payment or a
withdrawal.
The fees charged to customers for Wise’s services are shown to them upfront prior to a transaction,
or conversion being initiated. The applicable fees depend on a number of factors, including the
currency route, the transaction size, the type of transaction being undertaken and the payment
method used. The fees for card transactions are in accordance with the agreed terms and
conditions.
The revenue is recognised at the point in time the performance obligation has been satisfied. For
money transfers, the revenue is recognised upon delivery of funds to the recipient and for money
conversions, when a customer balance is converted into a different currency in their account. For
cards, the revenue is recognised upon transaction capture, unless it relates to the provision or
replacement of physical cards, in which case the revenue is recognised over time throughout the
period the debit card services are provided.
The time required for the Group to process the payment to the recipient and therefore to satisfy its
performance obligations, largely depends on the processing time its banking partners require to
deliver funds to the recipient. As such the revenue is deferred until the funds are delivered.
Transactions in certain jurisdictions, where the Group has settlement accounts with Central Banks,
transfers between Wise accounts or conversions within a Wise Account, are generally fulfilled
instantly.
Rebates
Wise offers certain rebates in the form of a fee refund or cashback for eligible revenue generating
transactions. The rebate is recognised as a liability at the time of completion of the eligible
transaction and is deducted from revenue.
Other - Assets revenue
The Group also generates revenue from its multi-currency investment feature, Wise Assets
(‘Assets’). This feature allows customers to purchase units in investment funds, provided by fund
managers, using their Wise account balance. The Group generates revenue from charging a fee
based on the value of the assets under custody. The revenue is accrued on a daily basis and is
recognised over time, in line with the period the Group provides its services to Assets customers.
The Group acts as a matched principal broker and does not retain control nor benefits from the
Assets, thus it does not recognise the financial assets and the respective liabilities for the Assets,
and derecognises customer funds on purchase.
Below is the revenue split by customer type:

Note 6. Cost of sales and net credit losses on financial assets

Accounting policy
Cost of sales comprises the costs that are directly associated with the Group’s principal revenue
stream of money transfer, conversion services and debit card services. This includes:
• banking and other fees, net of applicable rebates, incurred in processing customer transfers and

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024

the costs of providing cards to customers;
• net foreign exchange costs generated due to customer transactions. Within the same line are
included the net foreign exchange differences from the revaluation of customer balances at period
end. Other product costs include product losses that are directly generated from consumer
transactions, including chargeback losses, as well as taxes directly attributable to customer
activity.
Critical accounting judgement
Net gains and losses from foreign exchange differences
Management applied judgement in classifying net foreign exchange gains and losses from
customer transactions, including the costs related to the difference between the published
mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate obtained by the Group in acquiring currency, as
cost of sales. The Group considers these costs as directly related to and incurred as part of
providing services to customers.

Note 10. Tax
Accounting policy
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, respectively.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised, or the deferred tax
liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets on
share-based payments are recognised for the share options not exercised at the balance sheet
date. The deferred tax assets on share-based payments are determined based on the share price
at the balance sheet date. The impact of recognition is split between income tax expense in profit
or loss for the year, for the element up to the cumulative remuneration expense; and the
share-based payment reserve, recognised directly in equity, for the element in excess of the
related cumulative remuneration expense.
The impact of the recognition of deferred tax assets on losses is split between the share-based
payment reserve, for the element of the tax deduction on exercise in excess of the related
cumulative remuneration expense, and the income tax expense in profit or loss for the balance of
the loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or
different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

The Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) before other comprehensive income (OCI) is a 26% charge (2023:
22% charge).
This equates to the applicable UK corporation tax rate of 25%, adjusted for a number of factors such
as non-deductible employee option plans, movements in provisions and higher overseas tax rates.The
prior year ETR can be explained by the same key factors, but was lower for the year-ended 31 March
2023 as the applicable UK corporate tax rate was 19%.

The deferred tax asset is predominantly generated in the UK and the US and mainly comprises unexercised share options which are forecast to be
exercised within four years and as such are less sensitive to changes in long-term profit forecasts.
The deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine recoverability and to determine a reasonable time frame for utilisation. To
determine this, the Group uses the approved Group forecast used for the viability statement and going concern analysis. The Group considers it is
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the coming years to realise the deferred tax asset. Consequently, the Group has unrecognised
deductible temporary differences of £nil (2023: £nil), with the net deferred tax asset being recognised in full as at 31 March 2023 and 2024.
Both the UK and the US utilised brought forward losses in FY2023 and in FY2024, with the UK taxable losses fully utilised as at 31 March 2024. Therefore,
there are no deferred tax assets in respect of losses recognised in the UK as at 31 March 2024. The Group expects deferred tax assets of £30.1m to
unwind within 12 months which will predominantly relate to exercised share options in the UK and US. The deferred tax asset on share options will also be
impacted by the future share price.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting published on 20
December 2021 the Pillar Two model rules designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy.
The Group operates in the United Kingdom (amongst other locations), which have enacted or substantively enacted new legislation to implement the
global minimum top-up taxes by 31 March 2024. The earliest period for which substantively enacted legislation is effective for the Group is the year ended

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024

31 March 2025, therefore there is no current tax impact of Pillar Two income taxes for the year ended 31 March 2024. The Group has performed an
assessment of the Group’s potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. This assessment is based on the most recent information available regarding the
financial performance of the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment performed, the Group does not expect any material top up taxes.
The Group is continuing to monitor potential future implications.

Note 11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the
Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, after
deducting shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of
shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares. For the
purposes of diluted earnings per share it is assumed that any performance conditions attached to the
schemes have been met at the balance sheet date.

Note 12. Property, plant and equipment

Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Items of property,
plant and equipment are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Computer equipment is not recorded in property, plant and equipment, but expensed as low-value short-lived equipment in the Group.
The accounting policy for right-of-use assets is included in note 17.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available for use, so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:
●
●
●

Right-of-use assets: lease term (1-7 years)
Leased office improvements: shorter of 5 years or lease term
Office equipment: 2 years

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Reviews are carried out if there is an indication that assets may be impaired, to ensure that property, plant and equipment are not carried at above their
recoverable amounts.

Note 13. Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets predominantly relate to internally generated software and other intangible assets and are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation.
Internally generated software
The Group develops software used in the provisioning of its services. Only the development costs that are directly attributable to the design,
development and testing of new software controlled by the Group are capitalised. Other development expenditures that do not meet the recognition
criteria under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

in a subsequent period.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part
of the software product comprise software development employee costs.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets primarily include licences and domain purchases. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life or
the term of the contract.
Amortisation
The Group amortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for mobile applications which are amortised over 2
years and licence purchases that are amortised over a period of 2-10 years.
Impairment of intangible assets
Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indicator that they might be impaired, for example when the assets are no longer in
use and need to be decommissioned.

In addition to the capitalised amounts as software, the Group expensed £115.8m of product engineering costs for the year ended 31 March 2024 (2023:
£91.8m). These costs directly relate to the development of the Group's product offerings and primarily comprise employee costs of the engineering and
product teams that do not meet the capitalisation criteria.
During the year, the Group removed from the asset register intangible assets with a total cost of £19.7m (2023: £15.3m), that have been fully amortised.

Note 14. Trade and other receivables

Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from payment processors, partners,
customers and collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparts. Trade and other
receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less
impairment for expected credit losses. The carrying values of current trade receivables
approximate their fair values due to their short maturity.
The Group recognises impairment loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECL') on financial
assets that are measured at amortised cost. The Group’s receivables are considered to qualify for
the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime credit losses to be recognised from the
initial recognition of the receivables.
Refer to note 18 for further information on expected credit losses.
The impairment loss allowance recognised during the year, relates to chargebacks and negative
customer balances. For chargebacks, the Group has established a provision matrix that is based on
its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and
the economic environment. For overdrafts, if an active non fraudulent account goes more than 30
days past due, according to the Group policy, it is perceived as an indication of a significant
increase in credit risk and the receivable is provided in full.

*Receivables from customers disclosed are net of expected credit loss provision of £41.3m as at 31 March 2024
(2023: £31.5m). The movement in the year is predominantly related to increased activity and the related increase
in customer balances, which resulted in the increase of negative customers’ balances older than 30 days.
Customer chargebacks decreased by £1.6m to £2.5m at 31 March 2024 (31 March 2023: £4.1m) and negative
customer balances increased by £11.5m to £38.9m (31 March 2023: £27.4m).

Note 15. Cash and cash equivalents
Accounting policy
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, on-demand deposits, term deposits used for
meeting short term cash commitments, money market funds (MMFs) and other short-term high
quality liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less, and e-money held with
payment processing partners. Due to the short duration of the cash and cash equivalents (less
than 3 months), the fair value approximates the carrying value at each reporting period.
Cash in transit to customers represents cash that has been paid out from the Group bank accounts
but has not been delivered to the bank account of the beneficiary.
Cash collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties are recognised under ‘Trade and
other receivables’ in the statement of financial position.
Customer deposits
As disclosed above, the Group recognises financial assets and liabilities for the funds customers
hold in their Wise accounts and the funds collected from customers, as part of the money transfer
settlement process, that have not yet been processed. The liability is recognised upon receipt of
cash or capture confirmation (depending on pay-in method), and is derecognised when cash is
delivered to the beneficiary.
Principles to determine the point of delivery are the same as applied in revenue recognition, see
note 3.
Critical accounting judgement
Customer balances
The Group recognises financial assets and corresponding liabilities for the funds customers hold in
their Wise Accounts and the funds the Group receives as part of the money transfer settlement
process. At the point that the cash is received from the customer, the Group becomes party to a
contract and has a right and an ability to control the economic benefit from the cash flows
associated with this balance. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have
a legally enforceable right to set off these financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle
them on a net basis or settle them simultaneously. Therefore, Management has concluded that the
recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the balance sheet is
appropriate.

Cash at banks, in hand and in transit between Group bank accounts include term deposits of £285.8m
(2023: £nil). Their settlement date is three months or less.
Of the £10,479.2m (2023: £7,679.4m) cash and cash equivalents at the year end, £1,061.1m (2023:
£671.1m) is the corporate cash balance of the Group. This balance is not related to customer funds,
which are held in Wise Accounts, or collected from customers as part of the money transfer
settlement process.
The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to
customer funds. Such requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. As at 31 March 2024, the Group held £5,290.5m (2023: £3,832.9m) of customer funds as
cash in segregated, safeguarding bank accounts at investment grade banking institutions and term
deposits. The remainder of safeguarded customer deposits were held across highly liquid global
money market funds (MMFs), treasury bonds and investment grade corporate paper, as allowed by
local regulations.

Note 16. Trade and other payables
Accounting policy
Accounts payable consist of obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in
the ordinary course of business from suppliers on the basis of normal credit terms and do not bear
interest.
Wise Accounts relate to the funds customers hold in their Wise accounts and the funds the Group
receives as part of the money transfer settlement process. They are non-derivative liabilities to
individuals or business customers for money they hold with the Group and do not constitute
borrowings. Refer to note 15 for details of the judgement Management has exercised in relation to
customers’ balances and the recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on
the balance sheet.
Outstanding money transmission liabilities represent transfers that have not yet been paid out or
delivered to a recipient.
Payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables are unsecured unless otherwise indicated; due to the short-term nature
of current payables, their carrying values approximate their fair value.

Note 17. Borrowings

Accounting policy
Revolving credit facility (RCF)
The RCF is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and is subsequently
carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised as interest expense using the effective interest method over the
term of the borrowing. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be
drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred and treated as a transaction cost when the
draw-down occurs. The Group presents the impact of transaction costs as part of financing cash
flows.
The Group uses the facility primarily for short-term funding, as such the facility has been recorded
as a current liability on the balance sheet.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee, the right-of-use of assets are recorded within the ‘Property, plant
and equipment’ line in the statement of financial position and are measured at an amount equal to
the lease liability. They are related to office spaces leased in various locations and depreciated on a
straight-line basis with the charge recognised in administrative expenses. The liability, recognised
as part of borrowings, is measured at a discounted value and any interest is charged to finance
charges. The Group presents the payments of principal and interest on lease liabilities as part of
financing cash flows.
The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases (leases with a
lease term of 12 months or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
Low-value assets comprise IT and office equipment with a purchase price under £5,000. Payments
associated with short-term and low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an
expense in profit or loss.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases
across the Group and they are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group
initially assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain it will exercise the
options and subsequently reassesses if there is a significant event or significant changes in
circumstances within its control. The Group has concluded it is not reasonably certain that the
options will be exercised.

Revolving credit facility (RCF)
The Group has access to a multi-currency revolving facility offered by a syndicate of eight lenders,
namely: HSBC Innovation Banking Limited, National Westminster Bank Plc, Citibank N.A., London
Branch, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, Barclays
Bank Plc, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., and The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland.
In December 2023, the Group exercised an accordion feature within the agreement to increase the
total available committed funding capacity by an additional £100.0m, increasing the total facility size
from £300.0m to £400.0m. The maturity date of the facility is in August 2025, and the agreement
offers two, one year, extension options.
The facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to SONIA plus a margin determined by reference
to adjusted leverage (calculated as a ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA). The agreement contains
certain customary covenants, including to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio not in excess
of 3:1 and interest cover (calculated as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to finance charges in accordance
with the terms of the agreement) not less than a ratio of 4:1 in respect of any relevant period.
The Group monitors compliance with the covenants throughout the reporting period and has
complied with all financial covenants for this and all reporting periods. The undrawn available
committed funds as at 31 March 2024 was £200.0m (2023: £50.0m).
The facility is secured by certain customary security interests and pledges including over shares in
certain Group entities (Wise plc, Wise Financial Holdings Ltd, Wise Payments Limited, Wise US Inc.,
Wise Europe SA and Wise Australia Pty Ltd), and fixed and floating pledges over assets and
undertakings of Wise Payments Limited, excluding customer and partner funds, share capital or
equity contributions maintained for regulatory purposes, cash paid into a bank or collateral account in
connection with, and for the benefit of, relevant card scheme providers and assets held in
safeguarded accounts or otherwise segregated for regulatory purposes.
Lease liabilities
As at 31 March 2024, the lease liabilities are £21.5m (2023 £14.5m) and relate to the expected terms
remaining on UK, US, Estonia, Hungary, Singapore, Belgium and Brazil office space leases discounted
at between 2.21% and 15.75%. The leases expire between 2024-2030.
The total expense, relating to short-term leases to which the lessee recognition and measurement
requirement have not been applied, for the year ended 31 March 2024 is £1.0m (2023: £1.4m).
The Group has extension options in office leases, which have not been exercised as at 31 March
2024. The potential future lease payments, should the Group exercise the extension options, would
result in an increase in the lease liability of £3.6m.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

The Group has a termination option in an office lease, which has not been exercised as at 31 March
2024. The potential future lease payments, should the Group exercise the termination option, would
result in a decrease in the lease liability of £0.5m.

Note 18. Financial instruments and risk management
Accounting policy
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets, at initial recognition, and subsequently measures them at:
●
●
●

amortised cost;
fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and
fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flows and the Group’s business model for managing them. The Group’s business
model for managing financial assets refers to how they are used in order to generate cash flows.
The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash
flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Cash flows in relation to purchase or sale of these
instruments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.

Financial assets at amortised cost
The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are
met:
● the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash
flows; and
● the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method
and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset
is derecognised, modified or impaired. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are
predominantly trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
The Group classifies debt securities (e.g. bonds) as FVOCI, as the contractual cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest, and the objective of the Group’s business model is achieved
both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
Financial assets through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria
to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial
assets through profit or loss include derivative assets.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises impairment loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECL') on financial
assets that are measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The
ECL assessment considers both the 12-month Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and the lifetime ECL, as
per IFRS 9 requirements.
For debt instruments held at FVOCI, collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties and

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

receivable from payment processors, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. The
Group’s policy only allows exposures to financial institutions with sound credit quality rating and
limits the exposure to a maximum amount. Furthermore, as per Group’s investment policy, the debt
instruments held at FVOCI consist solely of quoted bonds that are graded in the top investment
categories (rated A- and above) and, therefore, are considered to be low credit risk investments.
ECLs on such instruments are measured on a 12-month basis; nevertheless, when there has been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the allowance will be based on the lifetime
ECL. At every reporting date, the Group evaluates whether or not these financial instruments are
considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available
without undue cost or effort. The Group uses external credit ratings if available both to determine
whether the financial instrument has significantly increased in credit risk and to estimate ECLs. If a
bank or other financial institution has no external credit rating, the Group evaluates its credit
quality, where necessary, by analysing its financial position, past experience, and other factors.
The Group’s remaining trade and other receivables qualify for the simplified approach in calculating
ECLs, as they do not contain a significant financing component. Therefore, the Group does not
track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. To measure the ECLs, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit
risk characteristics and the days past due. The Group’s expected credit loss policy is to reassess all
trade receivables over 30 days past due, and provide an ECL allowance if the balance is deemed to
be at risk.
In calculating the ECL on the receivable recognised for chargebacks, the Group has established a
provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking
factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. For negative customer balances, if
an active - non fraudulent account goes more than 30 days past due, according to the Group
policy, it is perceived as an indication of a significant increase in credit risk and the receivable is
provided in full.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for the derivative liabilities, which are
classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal
derivative instruments used by the Group are foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards
and non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards. Such derivative financial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting date.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments are determined by mark-to market valuation
technique. The key inputs in the valuation model are the observable foreign exchange rates for the
currencies involved. These inputs are considered level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as they are
observable, but may not be quoted directly for the specific instruments.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to the main financial risks: liquidity, credit, and
market risk from its use of financial instruments. The Group’s financial risk management programme
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
a. Liquidity risk

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient
cash to meet operational needs.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it always has enough liquid
resources to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s position above the Group’s liquidity risk appetite.
The Group utilises an internal liquidity adequacy assessment process to assess the Group’s liquid
resources; this process includes an assessment of net stressed liquidity outflows over a number of
severe yet plausible stress scenarios. This ensures the Group maintains prudent levels of liquid
resources at all times to meet both regulatory and the internal liquidity risk requirements.
The Group assessed the concentration risk associated with refinancing its debt and concluded that it
is low. This conclusion is based on the diverse mix of available liquidity sources available to Wise
alongside robust internal cash reserves. The Group has not experienced any difficulties in sourcing
additional liquidity over the past twelve months.
The breakdowns of trade payables and borrowings into current and non-current are shown in notes
16 and 17. See also note 18 (e) for the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on
contractual undiscounted payments.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The credit risk exposure is managed at Group level
against the Group’s credit risk appetite. Wise actively manages credit concentration risk and it is
Wise’s policy to impose credit limits in order to control the exposure (amount and period) Wise has
with each counterparty considering their level of risk. These limits are set based on the credit rating
or perceived credit quality of each counterparty and approval must be obtained from the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO).
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk by class of financial asset is as follows:

c. Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from floating interest rate borrowings (refer to note 17) and
manages the potential that financial expenses increase when interest rates increase. Sensitivity
analysis is used to assess the interest rate risk.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from fixed rate interest rate assets and liabilities on Wise’s
balance sheet. The main fixed interest rate exposure for Wise is driven by the safeguarded assets
(mainly sovereign bonds) held as part of the investment portfolio. The interest rate risk is measured
and monitored through an interest rate stress (175 basis points move in interest rates) applied on the
bond assets, with an impact of £38.4m across all bond holdings.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate movement from holding assets and liabilities in
different currencies and guaranteeing customers a foreign exchange rate on their international
transfers for a short period of time. Wise actively monitors foreign exchange risk, and exposures are
managed through a combination of natural hedging and treasury products hedging.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards and
non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk:

*The Group mitigates the exposure to foreign exchange risk from movements in these currencies with a
combination of treasury products. For further information on the instruments the Group utilises to manage its
foreign exchange risk, refer to the ‘Foreign exchange risk’ section above.

The Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange fluctuations by currency is as follows:
A 5% strengthening or weakening of GBP against all other currencies, with all other variables being
constant, would result in a foreign exchange loss or gain of £1.6m (2023: £1.7m), excluding the tax
effect.
The Group considers a 5% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the
non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its
normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements, both under normal
operating environments and stressed conditions.
The Group’s capital comprises ordinary share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital risk are to:
●
●
●
●

safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that the Group can continue
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital;
adhere to regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction; and
fund an orderly wind-down in an adverse reverse scenario.

Further information on the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital, along with the
disclosure requirements under MIFIDPRU 8, can be found on our Owner relations website:
https://wise.com/owners/.
The Group is subject to prudential regulatory consolidation which follows the rules in the sourcebook
for MIFID investment firms (‘MIFIDPRU’). This is the case due to the existence of TINV Ltd, a group UK
FCA-regulated investment firm subject to the same rules.
Both TINV Ltd (MIFID investment firm) and the Group (MIFID investment group) are classified as
Non-small and Non-interconnected investment firms (‘non-SNI’).
The Group has complied with all external regulatory requirements in relation to capital in the year.
Overall own funds requirement
The Group own funds requirement is subject to the variable own funds requirement that is the
highest of :
1. its permanent minimum capital requirement (i.e. its initial capital requirement);

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

2. its fixed overheads requirement (‘FOR’); and
3. its K-factor requirement (‘KFR’).
The Group also follows and adheres to the Overall Own Funds Threshold Requirement as this is
derived by the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment (‘ICARA’) and approved by the board.
ICARA is a continuous risk assessment process which considers the business model implication on
capital and liquidity on an ongoing basis pursuant to the guidance of MIFIDPRU 7.

Fair value hierarchy
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified
into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair
values.
●

●

●

Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted
market prices at the end of the reporting period. Products classified as level 1 predominantly
comprise treasury bonds and investment grade corporate paper. The quoted market price
used for financial assets held by the Group is the current close price at the balance sheet
date.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is
determined using valuation techniques with the inputs that are observable either directly or
indirectly. The Group classifies foreign exchange contracts as level 2 financial instruments.
These instruments are valued by observable foreign exchange rates. There were no changes
to the valuation technique during the period.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the
instrument is included in level 3. The Group does not currently have any financial instruments
in level 3.

The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value by
the level in the fair value hierarchy as at the reporting date:

During the year, the Group allotted 100,000 Class A Ordinary Shares of £0.01 related to share options
granted under the Company’s legacy incentive plans prior to the Company’s admission to trading on
the London Stock Exchange (2023: 87,396 Class A Ordinary Shares of £0.01 related to customer
shareholder programme).
Each Class A Ordinary shareholder is entitled to one vote for each Class A Ordinary Share held,
subject to any restrictions on total voting rights as set out in the Company's Articles of Association.
Class A Ordinary shareholders are entitled to interim or annual dividends to the extent declared and
do not hold any preferential rights to dividends. Class A Ordinary Shares are non-redeemable.
Each Class B shareholder is entitled to nine votes for each Class B Share held, subject to any
restrictions on total voting rights as set out in the Company's Articles of Association. Class B Shares
carry no rights to distributions of dividends except on distribution of assets, up to their nominal value,
on a liquidation or winding up. Class B Shares are strictly non-transferable, non-tradable and
non-distributable to any person or entity whatsoever.

Note 20. Own share reserve
Accounting policy
Own share reserve
Own share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares of Wise plc that are held by the
employee share trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share
plans. Own shares are treated as a deduction from equity, and on exercising of employee awards,
are transferred from own shares to retained earnings at their weighted average cost.
Employee share trust
The Group provides financing to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either
purchase the Company’s shares on the open market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital,
to meet the Group’s obligation to provide shares when employees exercise their options or awards.

Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2024
13 June 2024

Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the consolidated income statement. The Group
consolidates this share trust.
Shares held by the ESOP Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares
until such time that employees exercise their awards. The consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), on purchase of Company’s equity instruments
is deducted from equity.
Purchase of own shares
During the financial year, Wise continued the programme, which commenced in 2023, to purchase
Wise shares in the market through the ESOP Trust in order to reduce the impact of dilution from
stock-based compensation. As of 31 March 2024, a total of 9,071,706 shares were purchased from
the market at an average of £7.56 per share. Directly attributable costs of £0.5m have been
charged to equity.

Note 21. Share-based employee compensation

Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of employee equity-settled schemes as part of its reward strategy,
which are designed to provide long-term incentives for all employees to deliver long-term
shareholder returns. Under the plans, participants are granted share awards of the Company,
which vest gradually over the vesting period and are equity settled for shares within Wise plc.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards
granted and it is calculated using the closing share price at the grant date. It is recognised in
employee benefit expenses together with a corresponding increase in equity (share-based
payment reserve), over the period in which the service and the performance conditions are fulfilled
(the vesting period). Upon exercise of share options, the impact is recognised in retained earnings.
For non-market-based awards, vesting conditions are included in the assumptions of the number of
options and awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the entity revises its
estimates of the number of options and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact
of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income, with a
corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve. For awards subject to a
market-based performance condition, no subsequent adjustments may be made.
Employee share award plans
The awards are subject to service conditions, i.e. the requirement for recipients of awards to
remain in employment with the Group over the vesting period, which typically is 4 years.
For the market-based award
For the market-based award, the vesting is conditional on achievement of the relative total
shareholder return (TSR) compared to the FTSE 250 and volume growth performance measures
over the 3-year performance period.

Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting.
These measures are not defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable with the
APMs of other companies.
The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing
alternative interpretations of the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed and
they are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis and reporting. These APMs
should be viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute for, measures presented in the financial
statements which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

therefore elected to remove this non-cash expense from our

reported under ‘Deferred revenue’ and ‘Other payables’ in note 16, which are not considered customer
related balances.
