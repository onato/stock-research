Wise plc
Q1 FY24 Trading Update
18 July 2023

Good start to the year with continued strong customer growth
●

33% YoY growth in quarterly active customers to 6.7m, driven by strong customer retention
and customer acquisition primarily through word of mouth.

●

Volumes increased 16% YoY to £28.2bn, driven by the continued growth in active customers.

●

Revenue increased 29% YoY to £240m.

●

Income grew 66% YoY to £311m as a result of growth in active customers and higher interest
income.

●

Wise account balances grew to £11.5bn by the end of the quarter. On these balances we
earned a gross interest income yield of 3.4% in Q1 FY24 (Q4 FY23: 2.8%) and the amount we
were able to return to Wise account customers increased to 0.9% (Q4 FY23: 0.6%).

●

Outlook for FY24 unchanged: Income growth of 28-33%, and adjusted EBITDA margin
remaining elevated (vs. our medium term guidance of at or above 20%) as a result of higher
levels of interest income net of customer benefits.

“This quarter we continued building our infrastructure and rolling out the account features that our
customers need to live, work or manage their businesses across borders. We made our payments
faster in Brazil, Australia and across a number of routes in Asia. Now 57% of payments on Wise are
delivered in under 20 seconds. Our Assets ‘Interest’ feature is now available to customers in 11
countries, after launching in Germany, Sweden and Norway this quarter. We improved our offer in
some existing markets too - customers in Europe now get more ‘Cashback’ on their balance, UK
customers can get a 4.22% return on GBP held in Assets, and US customers can get a 4.12% return on
their USD balances when they opt-in to earn interest.
“As our customer proposition continues to improve, more people and businesses are choosing Wise,
and it is this growth in customer adoption that will underpin our long-term success. This quarter, we
served 6.7 million active customers, an increase of 33% YoY, leading to 66% YoY growth in income.”
-Kristo Kaarmann, CEO and Co-Founder
