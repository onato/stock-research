Q1 FY2022 Trading Update
“Wise’s mission is to make moving and managing money across borders faster, easier,
cheaper and more transparent for everyone, everywhere. In the first quarter of this
financial year we continued to take important steps forwards towards this goal while also
successfully listing Wise on the London Stock Exchange.
“We were pleased that in the first quarter of this financial year we were able to reduce
pricing by 2bps to 0.67%, dropping prices for 19 currencies while also delivering 38% of all
transfers instantly. Our financials in that period were in line with our expectations with
revenues of £123.5m, representing a growth of 43% YoY compared to Q1 FY2021.
“As we enter the next phase of our growth to tackle the problem of the £150 billion the
world continues to pay in hidden fees each year, we’re focused on doing so reliably and
sustainably, so our customers know they can count on us for the long term.”
Kristo Käärmann Co-Founder & CEO

Mission highlights for Q1 FY2022
We continue to be driven by our mission and were pleased that in the first quarter of this
year we were able to reduce our average fees by 2bps to 0.67% after dropping prices for
customers on 19 currencies, while also delivering 38% of all transfers instantly.
Our coverage took an important step forward as we launched in India, allowing Indian
residents to send money to 40+ countries at the real exchange rate, with lower and more
transparent fees.
We also made it more convenient for Wise customers to receive money: over 1 million
customers have opted to receive money with just their email address.
It is still early in the development of our platform proposition but we are delighted to have
recently announced partnerships with Google Pay, Shinhan Bank, Temenos and Thought
Machine, allowing many more people and businesses to conveniently access Wise’s
cheap, fast and transparent international money transfers.

Revenue as a % of Volume

3.7m customers transacted on Wise in Q1 FY2022. Despite ongoing lockdowns across
many countries worldwide, the number of personal customers grew by 28% YoY to reach
3.4m. Business customers, who typically use Wise for a broader range of needs such as
paying and receiving funds from suppliers, vendors and customers, grew by 56%
compared to the prior year.
Volume grew by 54% YoY to £16.4bn, faster than the growth in customers. This was mainly
driven by the average volume per customer, which was significantly lower (19%), in the
first quarter of last year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer
demand for international payments, but quickly rebounded and has been broadly stable
since.
Revenue grew at 43% YoY to reach £123.5m in Q1 FY2022, in line with our expectations.
This growth in revenue was outpaced by YoY volume growth as certain higher-priced
routes returned to longer-term average levels of activity and a lower proportion of overall
volumes. This is reflected in the 6bps reduction in the take rate.
Compared to the prior quarter, the number of active personal customers using Wise grew
by 3%, while the growth in business customers maintained its strong momentum,
increasing 9% QoQ. With a greater proportion of business customers sending larger and
more frequent payments, the overall volume per customer for Wise increased by 2% QoQ.
As a result of the growth in customers and uptick in average volume per customer,
volume increased by 5% QoQ and revenue by 6%. The take rate was stable compared to
the prior quarter as a 2bps reduction in conversion fees was offset by additional fees from
the adoption of our Wise account.
We are pleased to have started FY2022 in line with our expectations and expect to
continue in line with our forward-looking guidance, including for revenue growth of low
to mid 20s on a percentage basis in FY2022.
