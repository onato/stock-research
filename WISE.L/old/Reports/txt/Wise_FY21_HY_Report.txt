Wise plc
Unaudited results for the six months ended 30 September 2021
“We’re on a mission to make moving and managing money across borders faster, easier, cheaper and
more transparent for everyone, everywhere.
Each quarter we strive to make progress on this mission. Over the first half of this year we’ve improved our
products and engineered away substantial points of friction in the payments process, enabling us to
sustainably lower prices while continuing to invest in growing the business for the long term. So a virtuous
circle of investment continues, and our service gets faster, better and cheaper than ever for our personal
and business customers.
Whilst we have made significant progress, millions of people and businesses continue to be overcharged
and poorly served by banks and other payment providers.”
Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer
Highlights for the six months ended 30 September 2021¹
We’ve made progress on our Mission
We managed to reduce the average price our customers pay for moving money across borders to
0.62% in Q2 FY22, down 7bps compared to the average prices in Q4 FY21;
Our payments got faster too. 40% of all transfers were delivered instantly in Q2 FY22;
We enhanced our Wise Account; excitingly we launched our Assets feature for customers in the
UK, and made the account more useful for businesses around the world, who can now issue
company cards to their employees and manage their expenses on Wise;
We’ve increased our platform partners with a further 10 partnerships commencing, taking the
total
number to 30, and
We expanded our customer base: we served 3.9 million active customers in Q2 FY22, an increase of
7% from Q1 FY22 or 23% as compared to Q2 FY21;
Combined, this progress is driving our growth: we transferred over £34 billion for our customers in
the period, 44% more than H1 FY21 (£24 billion).
We’ve become a stronger business, as we continue to generate healthy gross margins whilst reducing
prices for our customers and investing in our long term growth
While growing volume by 44%, we also engineered and optimised away marginal costs and
passed back the savings to customers;
As a result, whilst take rate reduced by 6bp to 0.75%, revenue grew by 33% to £256 million;
Gross profit grew by 46% to £174 million, with gross profit margin expanding from 62% to 68%;
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24% was slightly lower than the 26% margin last year due to planned
investment in our teams and products;
Free Cash Flow remains healthy, growing 39% to £59.0M compared to H1 FY21.
Outlook
Based on our progress and current outlook for volumes and price drops, we now expect annual
revenue growth for FY22 to be mid-to-high 20s on a percentage basis;
As a result of the larger than anticipated cost savings flowing through into price reductions in the
first half, we continue to expect the take rate to be slightly lower in the second half and for the
gross margin to be c.65-67% for FY22, subject to foreign exchange-related costs continuing to
remain broadly stable.

An update from Kristo, our Co-founder and CEO
We started Wise 10 years ago with the mission to make international banking faster, easier, cheaper and
more transparent for everyone, everywhere. We’ve come a long way since then, including some significant
strides forward in the last six months: we lowered costs and dropped prices (even faster than expected!),
our payments got faster, we developed more features for businesses, initiated more platform partnerships
and we launched our exciting new ‘Assets’ feature for customers in the UK.
Wise: infrastructure built for speed and efficiency
Improving our infrastructure allows us to lower our unit costs, letting us charge substantially less than
leading traditional banks and consistently below many payment companies. We proudly charge our
customers a transparent fee for each of our services, without cross-subsidising between customers,
products or routes. We calculate the precise costs of our offering, and we charge the customer that
amount plus a margin which we reinvest in the business. When our costs go down, we aim to lower our
prices as soon as possible. We do this because we can, because it’s fair, but also because we believe that
over time this approach will ensure we create the lowest cost way to move money around the world.
In the most recent quarter, this average customer price was just 0.62%, a reduction of 7 basis points as
compared to the average prices in Q4 FY21. This is a substantial reduction for millions of customers, with
an exceptional 5 basis points coming in the most recent quarter. This reflects the amazing work from the
team to reduce costs and our commitment to invest in sustainably lower prices.
We’re continuously increasing the speed of our transfers as we develop our infrastructure, and in the most
recent quarter 40% of our transfers were instant, 58% were delivered in under one hour, and 86% arrived in
under 24 hours. We’re able to estimate the time of delivery with an accuracy of nearly 80% which our
customers value as important information. This compares to the two to five business days, on average, it
takes a traditional bank to complete an international transfer with a high level of uncertainty on the exact
time-frame for delivery.
Our coverage took an important step forward in the period as we launched in India, allowing Indian
residents to send money to 40+ countries at the real exchange rate, with lower and more transparent fees.
We then went on to make sending money to India a lot faster and more convenient. With the rollout of
payouts via Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Wise customers can also send money to India instantly, and
without needing to know their recipient’s bank details.
Product and platform enhancements
Our Wise account continues to drive our growth as demonstrated by the 33% increase in our customer
balances from £3.7 billion as at the year end to almost £5 billion as at 30 September 2021.
The Wise account enables our personal and business customers to send, receive, hold, convert, and spend
money in a growing number of currencies, all in one place with only a few taps or clicks. In the past six
months we made the account even more useful: UK customers can now invest with the UK launch of
Assets. Assets give customers a potential return on their balance held with Wise by holding it in an index
fund, while still being able to spend and send in an instant as though it were held as cash. We’re also very
pleased to be announcing today the launch of cards in Canada.
Our Wise Business proposition improved in the period with the launch of a number of new features,
including the ability to attach receipts and notes to card transactions; and enhanced controls such as the
ability for an account holder to delegate tasks, payment approvals and assign spending limits to
accountants and team members.
Additionally, we have made further progress in serving customers through our platform partners. Wise
Platform allows many more people and businesses to conveniently access Wise’s cheap, fast and
transparent international money transfers. Over the last six months we are delighted to have announced
partnerships with Google Pay, Sable, Shinhan Bank, Temenos and Thought Machine, while enhancing the

4

service provided with existing partners, most notably with Monzo and OnJuno. It’s still early days but we’re
excited to help these Partners and their customers with their cross-border needs.
We’ve been investing in our infrastructure for a long time, and there is still a lot more to build. But it seems
to be working. Our most recent Net Promoter Score was 75, Wise is rated 4.6/5 on TrustPilot with over
135,000 reviews and scores 4.7 out of 5 on the Apple App Store. This helps drive our growth in customers, as
approximately 68% of new customers came through “word-of-mouth”. In the last six months customers
moved £34 billion through our platform, which represents a 44% growth over the same period last year.
But there are still many trillions moved outside of our platform, largely through the world’s banks. So we
have a long way to go to help these customers and achieve our Mission. Onwards.
Kristo.

A financial update from Matt, our CFO
Our mission is to create the best way to move and manage money around the world. We have a relentless
focus on solving the problems facing our customers whilst building a sustainable and profitable business
to support this mission. In doing this, and in particular, bringing transparency and fairness into how we
price our products, we’ve found a common ground of creating value for our customers and also for our
shareholders. A fundamental part of our mission is to reduce prices where we have engineered process
friction and costs away, or as a result of scaling.
In the second quarter of FY22, 3.7 million personal customers and 230 thousand business customers used
Wise Transfer and the Wise account to move and manage money across borders. This was an increase of
22% in the number of personal customers and 44% in the number of business customers as compared to
the same period last year which were 3.0 million and 160 thousand respectively.
Across the first six months of the year, we processed £34.4 billion in cross-border payments (£23.9 billion in
H1 FY21) which was a 44% increase as compared to the same period last year. Our personal customer and
business customer volumes grew by 39% and 61% to £25.9 billion and £8.5 billion respectively.
The volume growth was faster than the growth seen in the number of customers, driven by the average
volume per customer. This was significantly lower in the first quarter of last year due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on customer demand for international payments, but quickly rebounded in the
second quarter of prior year.
Furthermore, businesses typically send larger volumes compared to personal customers, and, as they
represent a growing proportion of the total number of customers, the average volume per customer for
the Group is gradually increasing and in the second quarter it stood at its highest point to date of £4.6
thousand.
In the first six months of FY22 we generated £256.3 million in revenue, a 33% increase versus £192.2 million
in the same period last year. Revenue is largely a function of the volume our customers move and the
prices we charge them.
Our cross-currency take rate reduced by 9bps to 0.65% in the first six months of FY22 as compared to
0.74% in the same period in the prior year. This was primarily as a result of the price drops mentioned
above, however, the comparison to the prior period is also impacted by route mix volatility at the onset of
the pandemic where we saw more volume being moved on higher priced routes. The reductions in price
were enabled by reduced unit costs from more favourable terms with our banking partners and lower FX
costs. With price reductions being funded in this way we are able to grow the business and strengthen our
market position while generating the same level of gross profit to reinvest into our future.
The total take rate reduced by 6bps to 0.75% in H1 FY22 as compared to 0.81% in the same period in FY21,
and is in line with the 0.75% in H2 FY21. This was less than the decline in the cross-currency take rate due to
5

the growth in other fees which now represent 13% of our revenue for the period. The popularity of the Wise
account has seen growth in other fees such as interchange fees on the account’s debit card and fees on
domestic transfers.
We produced £173.8 million of gross profit, a 46% increase as compared to £119.2 million in the same period
last year and equivalent to a 68% gross margin (H1 FY21: 62%). This was due to cost of sales only increasing
by 13% to £81.2 million from £71.8 million in H1 FY21. Increase in cost of sales is less than the increase in
volumes over the same period due to the aforementioned reductions in unit costs that we passed on to
our customers. This growth in gross profit, which is in line with our growth in volume, demonstrates that
reductions in price can be made whilst sustaining our ability to invest.
We have three primary areas of investment focus: marketing, our product and sustainably lowering prices;
all of which we believe in the long term drive more volume and more scale. This means we get to a lower
unit cost and even more capacity to invest. This is how we create sustainable shareholder value.
Administrative expenses increased 56% to £152.2 million in the first six months of FY22 (H1 FY21: £97.6
million) which is primarily due to increase in employee costs and outsourced services and other
administrative costs.
Employee costs increased £17.1 million or 25% to £84.8 million in the first six months of FY22 (H1 FY21: £67.7
million) as we continue to invest in our team to support further growth. We have expanded the size of the
team by 688 people or 32% over the last year, with 2,883 Wisers working to deliver our mission at the end
of H1 FY22.
Outsourced services and other administrative costs grew 101% to £58.3 million as compared to £29 million
in H1 FY21. This increase was primarily due to additional costs incurred as part of becoming a public
company, additional IT and marketing investments, as well as other costs relating to travel and events
returning post-pandemic.
Capitalisation in the first six months reduced versus the same prior last year by 74% to £2.5 million (£9.6
million in H1 FY21). We expect our capitalisation to remain broadly at this lower level going forward. This
change does not impact our cash flows and we continue to expand and invest in our engineering team.
Our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24% for the period (H1 FY21: 26%) which corresponds to £60.6 million of
Adjusted EBITDA (H1 FY21: £50.6 million) and a 20% increase over the prior year which reflects our
commitment to investment in future growth whilst maintaining sustainability in our approach.
In the first six months of FY22 our profit before tax was £18.8 million compared to £20.0 million in the same
period last year. This level of profit was slightly lower than the previous year as we continue to reinvest the
majority of the additional gross profit delivered in the period while also incurring exceptional costs in the
completion of our direct listing.
Free cash flow increased 39% over the prior year to £59.0 million (H1 FY21: £42.3 million) giving a free cash
flow conversion ratio of 97% relative to Adjusted EBITDA (H1 FY21: 84%). This year-on-year increase in free
cash flow reflects the underlying growth in Adjusted EBITDA.
As at 30 September 2021 we held £5.4 billion of cash and highly-liquid investment grade assets, up 32%
from the end of FY21 (£4.1 billion). The majority of these assets are used to cover the £4.9 billion of Wise
account customer deposits (£3.7 billion at the end of FY21), which we keep safeguarded and readily
available. We also hold £344.6 million of Wise’s “own cash”, which is increasing thanks to the cash
generating qualities of the business we’ve built.
We are well capitalised for the future and as at 30 September 2021, our group eligible capital of £230.7m is
significantly above the minimum requirements set by our regulators around the world. We expect Wise to
be subject to the new capital regime for investment firms in the UK known as Investment Firm Prudential
Regime (IFPR). This will become effective from 1 January 2022 prospectively. Wise is well in excess of the
upcoming new requirement and we do not expect any impact to our capital management policy in the
near term as a result of this change.
6

In summary, our growth has been fuelled by building products and features that customers love and
recommend. We re-invest our margins into improving our product and customer experience, marketing
to help spread the word, and sustainably lowering prices. Our focus on our mission will not change as we
continue to grow and scale, and neither will our focus on building a strong, sustainable and cashgenerating business that is best placed to address the evolving needs of our customers and, in so doing,
deliver shareholder value.
We’re on a mission that will take a long time. It’ll take investment, patience and commitment to our
strategy. But it’s working.

Financial outlook
Based on our progress and on our current outlook for both volumes and price drops in the second half of
the year, we now expect annual revenue growth for FY22 to be mid-to-high 20s on a percentage basis.
As previously guided, our strategy of reducing costs first and then lowering our prices means that the take
rate is expected to be slightly lower in the second half of FY22 compared to the first half. Our expectation
for the gross margin for FY22 also remains unchanged at c.65-67%, subject to foreign exchange-related
costs continuing to remain broadly stable.

Share issuance
As disclosed in the prospectus in respect of our direct listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2021,
several legacy employee share plans existed which, following admission, were to be closed to any further
options or awards being granted under any of these employee share plans. As at the date of the
prospectus, 93,959,944 vested and unvested options were outstanding under these legacy employee share
plans.
Wise operates an Employee Share Trust which can be used for the purpose of providing benefits to
employees and former employees of the Group, including satisfying options and awards granted under
the Company’s employee share plans through the provision of Class A Shares.
The Employee Share Trust held 48,852,622 Class A Shares as at the date of the prospectus, which were
available to satisfy the exercise or vesting of options and awards under the Company’s employee share
plans. Comparing the number of Class A Shares held in the Employee Share Trust with the number of
options outstanding indicated 45,107,322 additional Class A shares which may, at some time, be required to
provide the benefit offered under the legacy employee share plans.
Today, we have announced our intention to issue 30,000,000 Class A shares to be allotted to and held in
the Employee Share Trust until they are required to satisfy the exercising of vested options. We will review
our need to issue Class A shares in relation to legacy and new employee share plans on at least an annual
basis. In line with best practice for employee benefit trusts, the Employee Share Trust will not, without prior
shareholder approval, hold Class A shares representing more than 5% of Wise’s then issued share capital.

Adoption of the UK Corporate Governance Code
Following the direct listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2021, we have formally adopted the UK
Corporate Governance Code as published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and will be making the
required disclosures in our FY22 Annual Report and Accounts.

Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
for the half-year ended 30 September 2021 (unaudited)
Note 1. Summary of significant accounting policies
1.1 General information and significant changes in the current reporting period
Wise plc (the "Company") is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England. The
Company was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 on 18 February 2021 under the name "456
Newco plc" and changed its name to Wise plc on 17 June 2021. The address of its registered office is 6th
Floor Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JJ. The principal activity of the Company and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”) is the provision of cross-border money transfer services.
Group Reorganisation and Listing
The Class A ordinary shares of the Company were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 7
July 2021. In connection with the listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange on 7 July 2021, the
following steps were completed on 22 June 2021:
● the existing preferred and ordinary shares in Wise Payments Ltd were re-designated as A Ordinary
Shares and a share split was undertaken;
● the existing shareholders of Wise Payments Ltd were offered the opportunity to elect to receive
the B Shares, in addition to their A Shares, to create a dual class share structure comprising A
Shares and B Shares. Such B Shares were issued by way of bonus issue to such electing, existing
shareholders;
● the existing shareholders in Wise Payments Ltd entered into the share for share exchange with
Wise plc, pursuant to which Wise plc acquired the entire issued share capital of Wise Payments
Ltd in exchange for the issue of matching Class A Shares, Class B Shares and a non-voting
redeemable preference share in Wise plc to the existing shareholders (and any unexercised
options and unvested awards respectively over shares in Wise Payments Ltd were exchanged for
options over Class A Shares in Wise plc);
As a result of the restructure, Wise Payments Ltd transferred its share-based payment obligations to Wise
plc, who will be responsible for the settlement of the share-based payment awards. This transfer did not
impact the post-restructure consolidated results of the Group.
1.2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group have been prepared in
accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.
On 22 June 2021, in connection with the pre-listing reorganisation as disclosed in note 1.1, Wise Payments
Ltd shareholders entered into a share-for-share exchange with the Company. As a result, the Company
became the ultimate parent company of the Group and indirectly holds a 100% investment in Wise
Payments Ltd.
The restructure does not constitute a business combination under IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The
condensed set of consolidated financial statements included in this interim report have been prepared as
a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Wise Payments Ltd. As such, the comparative
and current period reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, equity merger
reserve and own share reserve of the Company as if it had always existed.

14

Wise plc Interim report for the half-year ended 30 September 2021, Registered number: 07209813
All amounts are in £ million unless otherwise stated

The interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial
report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report and Accounts of Wise
Payments Ltd (formerly known as TransferWise Ltd and former ultimate parent company of the Group) for
the year ended 31 March 2021 and any public announcements made by Wise plc during the interim
reporting period.
The interim report has not been audited or reviewed by auditors pursuant to the Financial Reporting
Council guidance on Review of Interim Financial Information.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the
adoption of new and amended standards as set out below.
1.3 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the Group from 1 April
2021:
●

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform –
Phase 2

The adoption of the above amendment did not have a material impact on the Group. There are no other
new or revised standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year
beginning on or after 1 April 2021 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
The following amendments have been published by the IASB and are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2022; the amendments have not been early adopted by the Group. None of
the amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting
periods or on foreseeable future transactions:
●
●
●

Amendments to IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract
Amendments to IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use
Annual Improvements to IFRS (2018-2020 cycle): IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Fees in the ’10 per
cent’ Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities

1.4 Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting.
These measures are not defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable with the
APMs of other companies.
The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing
alternative interpretations of the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed and are
used by the Directors and management for performance analysis and reporting. These APMs should be
viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute for, measures presented in the financial statements which
are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
●

●

Adjusted EBITDA: Measure of profitability which is calculated as profit for the year excluding the
impact of income taxes, finance expense, depreciation and amortisation, share-based payment
compensation expense as well as exceptional items.
Free Cash Flow: Represents the net cash flows from operating activities less the change in
working capital (excluding the change in collateral and other pass-through items), the costs of
purchasing property, plant and equipment, intangible assets capitalisation and payments for
leases.

Note 2. Segment reporting
Description of segment
The information regularly reported to the Board of Directors, who are considered to be the Chief
Operating Decision Maker, for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of performance, is
based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s business model, the Group has
determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is “Cross-border payment
services provider”.
The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference
to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position. The analysis of revenue
by type of customers and geographical regions, is set out in the note below.
The Group determines revenue across the following major geographical regions based on the customer
address:

* Comparative figures for the North America and Asia-Pacific regions have been re-presented. In the 2021
Annual Report and Accounts, a portion of revenue for North America was incorrectly presented as AsiaPacific revenues and vice versa.
The correct revenue for the full financial year 2021 for North America was £89.8 million and for Asia-Pacific
was £72.4 million. This did not impact the total revenue or the split for any other geographical regions.

* The deferred tax charge/credit predominately relates to share based payments.
Income tax expense for the current half-year period is calculated using the best estimate of the annual
effective tax rate expected for the full year, by geographical unit, applied to the pre-tax income of the six
month period, which is then adjusted for tax on exceptional items.
The effective tax rate for the half-year ended 30 September 2021 is 32% (half-year ended 30 September
2020: 27%). The rate for this half-year period has been affected by a number of one-off items, including
non-deductible listing costs and revaluation of deferred tax due to the substantive enactment of the
change in UK corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%.
On 24 May 2021, an increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective from 1 April 2023, was
substantively enacted. Therefore, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are expected to unwind
after 1 April 2023, have been re-measured in the current reporting period based on the increased UK
corporation tax rate and reflected in the statement of profit and loss and equity.

* The share capital presented reflects the share capital structure of Wise plc as if it had been the ultimate parent of the Group as of the comparative date.
On 22 June 2021, in connection with the preparation for the direct listing on the London Stock Exchange, Wise Payments Ltd undertook a share reorganisation in
which all shares (ordinary and preference) were redesignated into a single class of A Ordinary Shares. Following which, each Class A Ordinary Share was split into
26 Class A Ordinary Shares. Wise Payments Ltd then undertook a bonus issue of B Ordinary Shares.
On the same day and following the above share reorganisation, Wise Payments Ltd shareholders entered into a share-for-share exchange agreement with the
shareholders of Wise plc, acquiring Wise Payments Ltd's Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares with nominal values of £0.000 01 and £0.000 000 001, in exchange for
the issue of Wise plc Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares with nominal values of £0.01 (i.e. 1,000 times greater than the nominal value of Wise Payments Ltd's Class
A shares) and £0.000 000 001, respectively. As a result, Wise plc became the ultimate parent company of the Group, with a 100% indirect investment in Wise
Payments Ltd through Wise Financial Holdings Ltd.
Each Class A Ordinary shareholder is entitled to one vote for each Class A Ordinary share held, subject to any restrictions on total voting rights as set out in the
Company's articles of association. Class A Ordinary shareholders are entitled to interim or annual dividends to the extent declared and do not hold any preferential
rights to dividends. Class A Ordinary shares are non-redeemable.
Each Class B shareholder is entitled to nine votes for each Class B share held, subject to any restrictions on total voting rights as set out in the Company's articles
of association. Class B shares carry no rights to distributions of dividends except on distribution of assets, up to their nominal value, on a liquidation or winding up.
Class B shares are strictly non-transferable, non-tradeable and non-distributable to any person or entity whatsoever.

All amounts are in £ million unless otherwise stated

Note 16. Share-based employee compensation
The nature, accounting policies and key terms of the employee share option plan remain consistent with
that disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts, unless stated otherwise below.
After the reorganisation of the Group, as described in notes 1 and 15, share options for Wise Payments
Limited Ordinary shares were replaced with share options for Wise plc Class A Ordinary shares. The same
share-split ratio was applied as for the share capital reorganisation described in note 15.
As the result of the reorganisation, Wise Payments Limited transferred its share-based payment reserves
to retained earnings as the obligation to settle share-based payment awards would be with Wise plc. This
transfer did not impact consolidated results of the Group following the reorganisation and will be reflected
in the standalone financial statements of Wise Payments Limited.

Note 17. Contingencies
The Group does not have any material contingencies as at 30 September 2021 and 31 March 2021.

Note 18. Transaction with related parties
Kristo Käärmann and Matthew Briers are currently employed under service agreements with the
Company. Taavet Hinrikus is currently employed under a service agreement with Wise Payments Ltd.
Matthew Briers is eligible to participate in the Company’s annual bonus plan, but the other Executive
Directors’ service contracts do not provide for participation in an annual bonus plan.
David Wells, Ingo Uytdehaage, Clare Gilmartin and Hooi Ling Tan receive a nominal fee of £1 per annum as
remuneration for their duties for the Company. Alastair Rampell received no fee in relation to his duties for
the Company.
There were no other related party transactions which had a material impact on these condensed interim
financial statements.

Note 19. Alternative performance measures
The alternative performance measures ("APMs") used by the Group remain consistent with those disclosed
in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts of the Group and should be viewed as supplemental to, but not as
a substitute for, measures presented in the financial statements which are prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

the changes in the Group’s organisational structure and direct listing.

Note 20. Events occurring after the reporting period
On the date of this report the Company announced the intended issuance of 30 million class A ordinary
shares of £0.01 each in the capital of the Company, with such shares to be allotted by the Company to the
trustee of the Company’s employee benefit trust for nominal value, for the purpose of satisfying the
vesting of awards under the Company’s employee share plans. The shares, when issued, will be issued fully
paid and rank pari passu in all respects with the existing issued class A ordinary shares of the Company.

impact on its business.
