Q3 FY2022 Trading Update
“I’m delighted that for the first time we’ve supported more than 4 million customers to
complete cross-border transfers in a single quarter. We moved over £20bn; 38% growth on
last year and 15% growth on the prior quarter.
We did this while continuing to make good progress on our mission to make moving and
managing money across borders faster, easier, cheaper and more transparent for
everyone, everywhere. We dropped prices, sped up payments, and expanded access to
Wise’s products and features in more countries and through more partners.
Most notably, 45% of transfers were instant this quarter, and we launched the Wise card in
Canada, Brazil, and Malaysia, with the Wise account also going live in Malaysia.”

In line with our mission, growing volumes and reducing costs allows us to sustainably
reduce prices for our customers whilst generating gross profits for reinvestment. Over the
last year we dropped prices across 50 currencies, including 5 currencies in the most recent
quarter. Our customer price is now 0.60% on average, 9bps lower than a year ago and
2bps lower than the previous quarter.
Wise customers are also benefiting from faster payments with 45% of all transfers
delivered instantly this quarter, up from 40% in Q2. This was in part thanks to a constant
focus on improving how we operate, in particular by speeding up security checks and
resolving technical issues that were causing delays on payments sent to India.
In Q3, we launched the Wise Account and Card in Malaysia, and the Wise Card in Canada
and Brazil. Business customers are now able to make payments to China from 8
currencies while Alipay users will now be able to send money to China from any
supported Wise currency to an Alipay recipient.
Convenience is about providing access to Wise wherever it best suits our customers and
we have made further progress in serving more customers through platform partners in
the quarter. New partners include music royalty manager Eddy, armed forces credit union
Andrews Federal, and invoice platforms Bilingo and Libeo.

Customer price is based on a fixed basket of representative currencies which reduces the effect from route mix and other factors,
making it a more accurate representation of our progress in reducing the cost of international transfers over time.

Revenue as a % of Volume

Q3 FY2022 was a strong quarter with over 4 million customers transacting on Wise. The
number of active personal customers grew by 26% YoY to 4.1 million while the number of
active business customers grew by 39% to 250k compared to the prior year.
Volume grew by 38% YoY and 15% QoQ to £20.6 billion, driven by growth in the number of
active personal and business customers and a higher average volume per customer (VPC).
Our business customers’ VPCs are seasonally strong in Q3 but have nonetheless grown
13% YoY. This reflects that as our customers grow, so do their VPCs, as well as reflecting
the increased adoption of the Wise Account and card.
Revenue grew by 34% YoY and 13% QoQ to £149.8 million, broadly in line with the rate of
growth in volume. Our continuing efforts to engineer and optimise away costs to support
sustainably lower prices for customers resulted in a lower take rate as expected, reducing
to 0.73%, down 2bps YoY and 1bp QoQ. This reflects the price drops which are partially
offset by incremental revenue from other sources beyond cross-border transactions.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect the take rate to be slightly lower in the second half
of FY2022 compared to the first half as a result of price reductions. This is expected to be
more than offset by higher volumes as we now anticipate revenue growth of c. 30% for
FY2022 over FY2021. We continue to expect gross margin for FY2022 to be c.65-67%,
subject to foreign exchange related costs continuing to remain broadly stable.
Please see the appendix for further historical financial information. Wise will release
FY2022 results on 28 June 2022.
