Q3 FY26 Trading Update
20 January 2026


                 Strong volume growth of 26%1 with customer holdings up 34%

    ●​ Quarterly cross-border volume grew +25% YoY (+26% YoY on a constant currency basis),
        to £47.4bn, with 10.9m active customers using Wise in Q3 (+20% YoY)
    ●​ Increased diversification of income as popularity of the Wise account continues, with
        customer holdings growing by +34% to £27.5bn, and card and other revenue increasing
        +30% YoY
    ●​ Wise Business active customers rose +25% YoY to 542,000 as volumes grew strongly
        +37%
    ●​ Cross-border take rate flat in the quarter at 52bps, down from 56bps a year ago, reflecting
        continued focus on investing for long-term growth
    ●​ Underlying income was £424.4m in Q3 FY26, up +21% YoY on a reported basis. On a
        constant currency basis, underlying income grew by +21% in Q3 YoY, +17% YTD, and we
        expect to be around the middle of our guided range of 15-20% growth for FY26
    ●​ Focused on the long-term growth opportunity and becoming ‘the’ network for the world’s
        money while investing to target an underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16% in the
        medium term. We now expect FY26 underlying PBT margin to be towards the top of this
        range, including costs related to Wise’s dual listing.


“We served nearly 11 million active customers this quarter, helping more people and businesses
around the world with more of their financial needs. We launched the Wise travel card in India to
exciting demand, with over 75,000 customers joining the waiting list in just one month, and
introduced Google Pay for customers in the Philippines as the first non-bank to do so. We secured a
conditional licence approval in South Africa – our first in Africa, and went live with our direct
integration to Japan’s Zengin system, bringing our total number of direct integrations to domestic
payment systems to eight.

“We delivered 74% of payments instantly, up nine percentage points year-on-year. This is a clear
benefit of our continued focus on infrastructure - our licences, integrations, technology and
operations.

“Our financial performance in Q3 and throughout FY26 has been strong and we remain on track to
meet our guidance. We expect to complete our dual listing in the first half of 2026, which will further
increase our profile in the US as we remain focused on accelerating global growth and becoming the
network for the world’s money.”

-Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer
