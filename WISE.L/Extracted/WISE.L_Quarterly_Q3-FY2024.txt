Wise plc
Q3 FY24 Trading Update
16 January 2024


   Customer momentum continues to power growth; FY24 income guidance upgraded

Customers love the Wise Account features, and this is driving active customer growth
   ●   Active customers grew 30% YoY to 7.5 million, driven by increased adoption of the Wise
       Account and multi-feature usage.
   ●   Active personal customers increased 30% YoY to 7.1 million, and active business customers
       increased 23% YoY to 392k.
   ●   46% of Personal customers and 60% of Business customers now use multiple features (e.g.,
       using their Wise card as well as sending money across borders).
   ●   And this is important, because we know that customers that use multiple features transact
       more often and have higher retention levels.


This growth in multi-feature customers is driving the fundamentals of our financial performance,
leading to a 40% increase in Income to £375.1m
   ●   Cross-border volume was £30.6bn, an increase of 16% YoY (18% on a constant currency
       basis).
           ○     Volume growth remains strong among customers sending <£10k per month,
                 continuing to grow significantly faster than customers sending >£10k per month; as a
                 result personal VPC for Q3 was 1% lower QoQ.
   ●   Revenue increased 23% to £276.6m, supported by a 7bps increase in the ‘other take rate’ as a
       result of increased card spend.
   ●   Wise Account balances increased 28% YoY to £12.9bn; gross yield on balances was 4.2% in
       Q3 FY24 (vs 3.8% in Q2 FY24), of which 1.1% (vs. 1.0% in Q2 FY23) of balances, or £33.7m,
       was returned to customers.


FY24 Income growth guidance upgraded to c.42-44% from previous guidance of 33-38%
   ●   Reflects the continued strong growth in active multi-feature customers, and higher levels of
       interest income.
   ●   We continue to expect our adj. EBITDA margin in FY24 to remain elevated relative to our
       medium-term guidance of at or above 20% given the high net yield on customer balances.


“I am pleased to report another quarter of progress as we work towards our mission of building the
best way to move and manage the world’s money. We’ve sped up global USD payments by optimising
payouts with one of our banking partners and expanded our Wise Interest Asset offering in seven
European markets including France and Spain. Customers in these markets holding USD with Wise
can now opt in to earn a return on these balances too. We also progressed with more platform
partners, adding UK business bank; Allica Bank, leading digital travel platform; Agoda, and global
spend management solution Payhawk among others. This progress speaks to the strength of our
fundamentals, leading to continued strong financial performance. We saw our customer base grow by
30% supporting a 23% growth in revenue, and a 40% increase in Income.




                                                                                                        1
These results are also testament to the depth of expertise of both leadership and the teams at Wise. I
want to thank Harsh for leading the business while I took a sabbatical from September to December
to spend time with my growing family. I’m excited to be back and to continue progressing on our
mission.”
