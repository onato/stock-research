         Unaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2025
                                      Strong financial performance, investing for growth

“Over the first six months of this financial year, we focused on strengthening our
infrastructure and expanding the functionality of our products to capture a greater share of
the £32 trillion annual market opportunity for cross-border payments.

We are now a direct participant of 7 domestic payment systems, most recently Pix, the
domestic payment system in Brazil, and will complete our eighth, with Zengin in Japan,
later this month. In October, we also secured regulatory approvals from the Central Bank of
the UAE, to bring our products to the country. Enhancements like these make our
infrastructure increasingly efficient: 74% of transfers are now completed instantly, and our
average cross-border take rate is at 52 bps.

We made the Wise account more useful: travellers get easy access to key information like
exchange rates and the location of the nearest ATM with our new Travel Hub and we're
making family spending easier with accounts for under 18s. We made it possible for more
customers to earn a return on their balances through the launch of Wise Assets in Brazil.
We also announced new Wise Platform partnerships, including Upwork, MBSB Bank and
Lunar, further embedding Wise into the global financial system.

These developments continue to support our growth and helped drive active customers of
13.4m in the period - an 18% increase on HY FY25 with cross border volume up 24% to
£84.9bn, and customer holdings1 up 37% to £25.3bn as at 30 September 2025.

Looking ahead, we remain focused on building for the long term: investing in product
innovation, infrastructure and partnerships that make moving and managing money even
faster, cheaper, easier and more transparent for our customers worldwide.“
- Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer

An update from Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer
Our vision is to become ‘the’ network to move and manage the world’s money.

Over the last six months we continued to make progress on our long-term journey, serving
13.4m active customers and powering £84.9bn in cross border volume. The investments we are
making into our infrastructure, marketing and products are bringing us closer to our ambition to
one day move trillions rather than billions around the world.

We will do this by continuing to develop our global payments network, enabling more instant
payments and lower pricing over time, with 74% of transactions already instant at an average
cross-border take rate of 52bps. Our growth is being delivered with an underlying PBT margin
closer to our medium-term target and with strong cash generation. For the six months ended
30 September 2025, our underlying income was £749.5m and underlying PBT margin was
16.3%.

Wise has grown quickly and our potential remains huge
Earlier this year, we held our first Owners’ Day, where we described the massive problem that
continues to exist for people and businesses around the world; moving and managing money
internationally remains expensive, slow, inconvenient and opaque.

The opportunity that comes with solving this problem is enormous, estimated at around £32
trillion across personal, SMBs and large enterprises. We currently have around a 5% and 1%
share, respectively, of the expanding personal and SMB market segments, and we’re just
getting started in the large enterprise segment of the market.

The network that we’ve spent over 14 years creating provides Wise with the unique opportunity
to move trillions rather than billions around the world as ‘the’ network for the world’s
cross-border payments, as well as being the market leader in providing people and businesses
with an account that is truly international.

We remain laser focused on improving our infrastructure and products to help us achieve our
goal: this half year, we gained new licences, launched new direct integrations to domestic
payment systems and rolled out new products.

This infrastructure and our strong product set will fuel our growth and drive increased share in
the huge market opportunity ahead of us.

An infrastructure that enables instant movement of money around the world at the lowest
possible unit cost
We continue to deepen our infrastructure, enhancing how we operate across our network
which spans over 160 countries, with 40 currencies.

The key differentiator of our infrastructure and the network we’re building is the integrations we
have into domestic payment systems. These connections give us full end-to-end control of the
payment network, allowing us to complete payments instantly, with a simplified process and
reduced costs. They also improve reliability, convenience and speed. Our direct participation
into Brazil’s domestic payment system, Pix, is now live and we expect to go live in Zengin,
Japan’s domestic payment system, later this month.




                                                                                                   6
We operate in a highly regulated environment and hold over 70 licences globally. So far this
year we’ve been delighted to receive a number of additional regulatory approvals. This includes
full licence approvals in the UAE, covering Stored Value Approvals and Retail Payment
Services. We have also launched our Wise Assets product in Brazil, allowing more customers to
make a return on their balances held with Wise.

Like any regulated financial institution, we are subject to regular inspections and audits, which
may lead to areas of improvement being identified. Between July 2022 and September 2023,
the Multi-State MSB Examination Taskforce (MMET) conducted a routine examination of Wise
US, Inc. Wise fully cooperated with regulators to implement their recommendations. As part of
the consent order in July 2025, Wise also agreed to pay a $4.2m penalty. We are on track with
our related remediation program.

We are investing in building products that customers love, at prices worth talking about
Through the Wise Account, Wise Business, and Wise Platform, we serve millions of people,
small businesses, financial institutions and enterprises all over the world.

With continued investment in intuitive features for customers, combined with low cost, fast
payments, the quality of our account speaks for itself. We consistently see around two-thirds of
new customers join us through word-of-mouth from existing customers. However, to reach
every potential customer, we have recently launched marketing campaigns to increase brand
awareness of Wise. We have rolled out campaigns in the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand to
support our strong word-of-mouth growth, in addition to a continuation of the successful
campaigns we kicked off in Australia last year.

We are also investing to enhance our products and have launched more features within the
Wise Account to help people and businesses move and manage their money. Once a customer
is an account holder, we see increased retention and diversified product usage, with
non-cross-border revenue representing 41% of total underlying income in the period.

More customers using the account features has also led to an increase in customer holdings
with Wise. As at 30 September 2025 customers held £25.3bn with us, 37% higher than this
time last year and this includes over £5bn of funds in the ‘Assets’ feature.

Wise Business has grown significantly over the past six months, allowing more business
owners to be paid like locals with local account details, tools like Quick Pay and invoice
creation now in 23 languages. These product enhancements have helped increase volumes by
35% year on year, to £24bn.

As we enhance our infrastructure, develop our products and reduce pricing, we also see a
greater number of Wise Platform partners choosing Wise to help them and their customers with
their cross border needs.

In the last six months we began new Wise Platform partnerships with Raiffeisen Bank
International, UniCredit and Upwork. These partnerships start with a subset of customers and
currencies and, over time, we build in extra currencies, further volume and serve more
customers. We are already starting to see this happen, in line with the growth trajectory we
described in our Owners’ Day. Today, around 5% of Wise’s cross-border volume is driven by
Wise Platform, up from 4% as reported at our Owners’ Day. We continue to expect this to
increase materially, to around 10% in the medium term, and over 50% in our long-term vision.



                                                                                                7
New technology
Stablecoins are becoming a more visible part of the payments ecosystem and could be an
exciting development in how money moves globally. At Wise, we have spent more than a
decade building the infrastructure that delivers what many see as the promise of stablecoins:
instant, low-cost and reliable cross-border payments. New technology will not only need to
improve upon the speed and cost of our cross-border transfers, but it will also need to do so in
a safe way - being regulatory compliant and legitimate from a financial crime perspective.

Where there is real demand or benefit to customers, we will look to provide compliant access to
digital assets or leverage the technology, while also considering the important role of
interoperability the Wise infrastructure can play within a payments ecosystem that is growing
ever more fragmented with the availability of new forms of currency and payment rails.

Dual listing
Looking forward and in keeping with our vision to be ‘the’ network to move the world’s money,
we want as many people, businesses and potential Wise Platform partners to know about Wise
and what we do. Our US listing will increase our profile in the biggest market opportunity in the
world for our products today, as well as enabling better access to the world’s deepest and most
liquid capital market. We are grateful to our Owners for supporting this move, which will enable
more investors to hold our stock and also benefit from our growth. We remain on track for a
listing in Q2 2026.

We’re confident in the outlook for the second half of the year and beyond
Over the last six months we’ve made a strong start to the investments in our infrastructure,
marketing and products that we outlined at our Owners’ Day which will, over time, contribute to
further improvements to speed, unit cost and our proposition for customers from personal to
Wise Platform.

We continue to expect these ongoing investments to move us towards an underlying PBT
margin of c.16% for FY26, excluding one-off costs related to our dual-listing project. This
remains at the top end of our medium-term guidance of 13-16%.

We are making good progress on our mission. We are a much bigger business delivering
exceptional growth and profitability for our customers and shareholders and I’m confident we
will continue on this path to provide value for all our stakeholders.

An update from Emmanuel Thomassin, Chief Financial Officer

Delivering on our commitment to sustainable growth

I'm pleased with our financial performance for the first half of FY26, a period that clearly
demonstrates the impact of our investments across the business. We've achieved good
financial results, reflecting our long-term commitment to profitable growth. I'm particularly
encouraged by the pace of our investment, which positions us well for continued expansion.
This is evident in our H1 underlying Profit Before Tax (PBT) margin of 16.3%, underscoring the
effectiveness of our strategy to balance investment with profitability, ensuring that we are
building a resilient and scalable business for the future.

Our performance over the period demonstrates consistent momentum:

   ●​   Active customers have grown 18% to 13.4 million
   ●​   Cross-border volume has grown 24% to nearly £85 billion
   ●​   Customer holdings have exceeded £25 billion, with growth of 37%
   ●​   Underlying income has grown 13% to £749.5 million
   ●​   Underlying profit before tax margin has been delivered at the top end of our 13-16%
        target range

This statement details how we have achieved this through targeted investments that strengthen
our competitive position and broaden the foundation for long-term growth.



Sustainable growth and investments in price - setting up the foundation of our success


Customer growth remains a key measure of our performance. In H1 FY26, over 13 million active
customers used Wise to complete an international transaction. Personal customers increased
18% year-on-year to 12.8 million and business customers increased 17% year-on-year to
613,000, reflecting improving growth momentum in this segment.

During the first half of the year, we acquired 3.5 million new active customers, representing an
increase of 14% compared to the prior year period. This acceleration reflects our strategic
marketing investments, detailed in subsequent sections.

This strong customer growth is the main driver of volume growth, with cross-border volume
increasing 24% year-on-year to nearly £85 billion, or 26% on a constant currency basis. This is
particularly impressive, considering the market volatility we saw in the first half of the year.

This growth is also supported by a greater proportion of customers sending larger amounts, a
key indicator of how our targeted investments into price result in growth over time.

Wise Platform also continues to scale, now representing approximately 5% of cross-border
volume. We onboarded significant partners including Unicredit and Raiffeisen Bank during the
period, whilst delivering continued growth from our existing partner base.




                                                                                              9
At 24%, cross-border volume grew at a faster pace than cross-border revenue growth of 5%
year-on-year as our cross-border take rate decreased 10 basis points year-on-year to 52 basis
points. This reduction in take rate represents a strategic investment into reduced prices, driving
long-term customer acquisition, retention and advocacy.

Account adoption: building deeper relationships and diversifying our revenue base

Wise Account adoption is central to our strategy of increasing customer retention and
broadening product usage. In H1 FY26, non-cross-border revenue represented 41% of total
underlying income, demonstrating successful diversification of our revenue base and creating
multiple growth engines within the business. In particular, card volume exceeded £15 billion in
the period, generating £132 million in card revenue, an increase of 28% year-on-year.

Customer holdings have also increased substantially. As of 30 September 2025, our customers
held nearly £20 billion in Wise Accounts and invested £5.6 billion in Wise Assets, bringing total
customer holdings to over £25 billion. Balances held in the Wise Account generated £297
million in interest income during H1, albeit marginally lower year-on-year due to reducing
market yields.

As a result, revenue increased 11% year-on-year to £658 million, and underlying income
increased 13% year-on year to £750 million.



Investment Strategy: building for the future


In H1 FY26, reported administrative expenses increased 27% year-on-year to £466 million,
including approximately £11.5 million in expenses related to our dual-listing project or 24%
year-on-year excluding these, which is in line with last year’s growth.

The greatest form of investment has been into the growth of our team, with over 1,000
additional colleagues joining Wise during the first half of the year and we expect to continue
hiring in the second half. This exceeds our initial plans for the year and reflects deliberate
investment into the capacity and capabilities designed to drive long-term growth, including an
increase in servicing functions to meet operational demand, improve SLAs, and meet regulatory
requirements, while continuing to implement AI solutions to drive efficiencies.

For the full year, we expect administrative expenses of approximately £1 billion, including
approximately £35 million of costs associated with implementing the dual-listing of Wise shares
across the US and UK. This growth reflects the investments made to support a larger and more
active customer base, as well as those made to fuel further growth.

Servicing: building for scale

Our investment into servicing increased 20% year-on-year to £134 million, as we grew the
operational infrastructure required to onboard and support our growing customer base. We
have built new teams to support growth of high volume customers, and we continue to invest
into our compliance processes, as these are critical to the success of our business.



                                                                                                10
Our historic investments have been paying off with improvements to our main customer service
metrics. We have also started to see the benefits of AI and automation in customer service, and
expect to continue investing in this area.


Marketing & sales: strategic, diversified growth

Our investment in marketing and sales, which includes channel spend and employee expenses,
among others, increased 59% year-on-year to £57 million in H1 FY26, with investment across
multiple channels, including the deployment of brand marketing. We have increased brand
marketing expenditure to build awareness and drive organic traffic growth, executing
campaigns across key markets, which we expect to continue to do.

The continued strength of word-of-mouth customer acquisition, alongside the return on these
investments validates our approach with over 3.4 million new customers completing an
international transaction with Wise in H1 whilst we continue to invest with a relentless focus on
payback returns.


Technology and development: innovation across the board

Our total investment in product development, including our teams and ongoing investment into
our technology, totalled £144 million in H1, an increase of 18% year-on-year, allocated across
multiple development streams. We continue to enhance core product experiences, maintaining
and improving our existing products, launching new products, features and capabilities, and
rolling-out existing products in new markets.


Setting up the right foundations for scale

Investment into other corporate functions increased 35% to £131 million, supporting capabilities
needed to operate in a highly regulated and increasing financial crime risk environment, and
investment to drive sustainable long-term growth. With the impending dual-listing we are also
increasing our investment in the controls and systems uplift which will be required under US
rules.



The virtuous cycle in action


Our financial framework demonstrates how operational improvements create a compounding
effect: efficiency improvements enable faster speeds and price reductions, which drive
customer growth, leading to volume growth and increased profitability, part of which funds
further investment.

This framework is evidenced in our margin progression. The high level of margin seen
generated in H1 FY25, when we reported an underlying PBT margin of 22%, has now been
reinvested, with our underlying PBT margin now at 16.3%, returning towards our target range of
13-16%. As a result underlying PBT was £122 million in H1 FY26, down 17% year-on-year.




                                                                                               11
As you may recall, our underlying interest framework only considers the first 1% yield we
receive on interest income, as we are committed to building a business that is sustainable
without relying on cyclical forms of income - such as interest.

However, including additional interest income beyond the first 1%, less benefits paid to
customers, our reported profit before tax for the period was £255 million, a reduction of 13%
year-on-year. This mainly reflects our investment back into the business, in line with our target
underlying PBT margin framework, in addition to a lower interest yield environment during the
period.

Outlook for FY26 and beyond

Looking ahead, we are reiterating our guidance of:

   ●​ underlying income growth of 15-20% on a constant currency basis in FY26 and over
      the medium term
   ●​ underlying PBT margin for FY26 of around 16% excluding one-off costs of c.£35m
      related to our dual-listing project, at the top of our mid-term target range of 13%-16%



Capital allocation: disciplined and shareholder-focused


Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined and focused on long-term shareholder
value creation. We maintain a robust capital and cash position to ensure resilience and
operational flexibility appropriate for a regulated financial services business.

At our Owners Day, we announced a share repurchase program of approximately 25 million
shares into our employee benefit trust to fund existing employee share options. This program
commenced in early FY26. To date, we have completed c.50% of shares repurchases from the
programme. This program reflects our commitment to disciplined capital allocation whilst
ensuring we maintain our ability to attract and retain exceptional talent. We expect to complete
this repurchase program through the remainder of FY26 and will provide an update on capital
allocation in our FY26 results in June 2026.

In summary, we are executing our strategy with discipline and delivering strong performance
across all key metrics. We are expanding our customer base, deepening customer
engagement, diversifying revenue streams, and investing strategically for future growth, whilst
generating profitability within our target range.

The fundamentals of our business remain strong and position us well for continued sustainable,
compounding growth.

On behalf of the Board of directors:



Kristo Käärmann, Director
Date: 6 November 2025




                                                                                                      14
Independent review report to Wise plc
Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements

Our conclusion
We have reviewed Wise plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim
financial statements”) in the Unaudited interim results of Wise plc for the 6 month period ended
30 September 2025 (the “period”).

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK
adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority.

The interim financial statements comprise:

   ●​ the Condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025;
   ●​ the Condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period then
      ended;
   ●​ the Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period then ended;
   ●​ the Condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended;
      and
   ●​ the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.

The interim financial statements included in the Unaudited interim results of Wise plc have
been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim
Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the
United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.


Basis for conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review
Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the
United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of
making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
applying analytical and other review procedures.

A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

We have read the other information contained in the Unaudited interim results and
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the information in the interim financial statements.




                                                                                               15
Conclusions relating to going concern
Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit
as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our
attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis
of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going
concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review
procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or
conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.



Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review

Our responsibilities and those of the directors
The Unaudited interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility
of, and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the
Unaudited interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the
Unaudited interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are
responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the
Unaudited interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions
relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit
procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report,
including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of
complying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United
Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed
by our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
For the half-year ended 30 September 2025 (unaudited)



Note 1. Summary of material accounting policies

1.1 General information

Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England
(Registration number 13211214). These condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30
September 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’). The principal activity of the
Group is the provision of cross-border and domestic financial services. The address of its registered
office is 1st Floor Worship Square, 65 Clifton Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 4JE.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts
within the meaning of sections 434(3) and 435(3) of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for
the year ended 31 March 2025 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 5 June 2025
and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was
unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under
section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.

On 28 July 2025, Wise owners approved the proposed listing of the Company’s securities on a US
stock exchange, while retaining a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”). Following
this approval, the Group has initiated various preparatory activities related to the US listing process.

​       ​
1.2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group have been prepared in
accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'
and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial
Conduct Authority.

The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial
report. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025, which has been
prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006, and any public announcements made by Wise plc during the interim
reporting period.

The accounting policies and presentation applied by the Group are consistent with those in the
previous financial year.

Going concern

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the
Directors are satisfied that the Group has the available resources to continue in business for a period




                                                                                                            24
of at least 12 months from approval of the interim financial statements. In making this assessment, the
Directors have considered severe downside scenarios to stress test the viability of the business.
These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and liquidity as
well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.

The assessment indicated that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue its operations and meet
its financial obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from approval of the interim
financial statements and remained above its minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.

1.3 Critical accounting areas of judgement and estimation

In preparing these interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported figures. Management assessed that
there were no material changes in the current period to the critical accounting estimates and
judgements, as disclosed in the 2025 Annual Report and Accounts.

Note 2. Segment information

Description of segment
The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment. Based on the Group’s business model, the
Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is provision of
cross-border and domestic financial services.

The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for the reportable segment can be determined by reference to
the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of revenue
by nature and geographical region is set out in note 3.

At the end of each reporting period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise
Payments Limited in the UK and its branch in Estonia. Based on the location of the non-current asset, the
following geographical breakdown of non-current assets is provided:

Income tax expense for the current half-year period is calculated representing the best estimate of
the annual effective tax rate expected for the full year by geographical unit applied to the pre-tax
income of the six month period, which is then adjusted for tax on exceptional items.

The effective tax rate for the half-year ended 30 September 2025 is 26% (half-year ended 30
September 2024: 26%). The rate remains marginally above the UK rate due to a movement in tax
provisions and differences in overseas tax rates.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting published on 20 December 2021 introduced the Pillar Two model rules
designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy. The Pillar
Two regulation provides for an international framework of rules aimed at ensuring that worldwide profits
of multinational groups are subject to tax at a rate not lower than 15% in every jurisdiction in which a
group operates.

The Group operates in the United Kingdom (amongst other locations), which has enacted new legislation
to implement the global minimum top-up taxes. The first period for which enacted legislation is effective
for the Group is the year ended 31 March 2025.

The Group has performed an assessment of the Group’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. This
calculation is based on the accounting data for the first half of the 2026 fiscal year. Based on the
calculation, the Group does not expect any material top-up taxes under enacted or substantively enacted
Pillar Two legislation. The Group will continue to monitor and assess the application of these rules to the
Group.

Basic EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the Group’s owners by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, including, the ordinary
shares issuable for no consideration for which all conditions are satisfied (20.3 million shares as at 30
September 2025 and 24.3 million shares as at 30 September 2024).

Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from both basic and
diluted EPS calculations. At the end of the reporting period, there were 24.9 million (30 September
2024: 19.7 million) shares held in the ESOP Trust.

The diluted EPS calculation adjusts the weighted average number of shares used in the basic EPS
calculation by assuming all potentially dilutive shares convert into ordinary shares. Rights granted to
employees under employee share award plans, with a strike price and/or with conditions which have
not yet been met, are considered to be potential dilutive shares and therefore have been included in
the calculation of diluted EPS.

Cash at banks, in hand and in transit between Group bank accounts include term deposits of £259.6m
(31 March 2025: £204.2). Their settlement date is three months or less.

Of the £16,648.1m (31 March 2025: £13,982.8m) cash and cash equivalents at the period end,
£1,583.2m (31 March 2025: £1,430.2m) is considered the corporate cash balance, which is not related
to customer funds that are held in Wise accounts or collected from customers as part of the money
transfer settlement process.

The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to
customer funds. Such requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. Within the £9,642.3m (31 March 2025: £7,845.9m) of cash at banks and in transit between
Group bank accounts is £6,616.4m (31 March 2025: £5,807.5m) of customer funds in segregated,
safeguarding bank accounts and term deposits held at investment grade banking institutions, or the
highest possible credit-rated institutions in non-investment grade jurisdictions (bank ratings being
limited by the relevant country rating). The remainder of safeguarded customer deposits were held
across highly liquid global money market funds (MMFs), treasury bonds and investment grade corporate
paper, as allowed by local regulations. In addition, the Group implements a hybrid approach to
safeguarding UK customer funds via Comparable Guarantee, of total value of £845.0m (31 March 2025:
£520.0m), with nine investment grade sureties. The Group holds the amount equal to the value of the
guarantee in our customer network to support customer activity and liquidity.
