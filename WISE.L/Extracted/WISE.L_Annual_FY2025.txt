Market Overview

Building a new network for the world’s money

Moving and managing money around the world
has been slow and expensive for too long.

We’re fixing that.

With people and businesses becoming more international,
the need to move and manage money across countries and
currencies is growing. Driven by long-term trends, including
globalisation, increased international migration and technological
advances, the market for cross-border payments is only
expected to expand.

Traditional banks continue to dominate the market, providing
an expensive, slow and inefficient service via outdated
infrastructure and networks of intermediaries. And with
low transparency on fees, there has been little pressure on
them to improve their service or infrastructure – until Wise.

We have spent the past fourteen years building a replacement
infrastructure to bypass correspondent banking and make
moving money across borders faster, cheaper, easier and
more transparent. We have made great progress, but the
opportunity ahead of us is orders of magnitude greater and
ever growing. We process around 5% of consumer money
transfers across borders, just under 1% of those made by
businesses and, through our Wise Platform offering, we have
started to move money for large enterprises too. We continue
to gain momentum as our business grows and we are excited
about what the future holds.

Wise Platform: empowering partners
to build global payment solutions
Wise Platform is our market-leading global payment
infrastructure for banks, financial institutions and enterprises
around the world. Wise Platform provides these organisations
with the capabilities to serve their customers with a world-
class experience to send, receive, hold and spend money
cross-border instantly, reliably, securely and cost-effectively.

The total addressable market for cross-border payments
is substantial. However, we will not be able to reach the
hundreds of millions of individuals and companies involved in
these transactions by merely requiring them to download the
Wise app. Instead, our strategy is to extend our infrastructure
to enhance the tools and products people and businesses are
already using, through the Wise Platform.

With one simple integration, our partners can leverage all of
our infrastructure benefits to offer their customers the speed,
efficiency and transparency of Wise without the need to
rebuild their own systems.

This is why increasingly some of the world’s most recognised
financial brands, including Nubank, Monzo, Qonto and Brex, are
choosing Wise Platform. These organisations use all aspects
of our infrastructure: for example, multi-currency accounts,
receiving internationally, sending remittances, fulfilling global
payroll, as well as settling invoice and bill payments.

This year, we continued our progress towards becoming
the chosen cross-border infrastructure partner for banks
and enterprises everywhere. In particular, global banks such
as Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered have signed up
to power their cross-border needs through Wise Platform
(see page 27) and we have continued to expand our
footprint in Brazil by launching a partnership with Itaú,
Latin America’s largest bank, to enable its customers to
make international payments with the same ease and
simplicity as domestic payments.

Leadership training
We continue to run our flagship leadership training programme,
Leadership Essentials, to provide every Lead at Wise with a
solid foundation of knowledge in relation to leading a team,
performance management and team effectiveness. Wisers
whose Leads have attended this training positively endorse
their Leads support and attention to growth, compared to
Leads who are yet to complete the training.

In FY2025, we expanded our leadership development initiatives
with the launch of the Leadership Strengths programme for our
Senior Leads at Wise. Leadership Strengths offers a personalised
development journey that highlights an individual’s unique
strengths and provides them with one-on-one leadership
coaching and tailored learning paths, as well as offering
opportunities to build a leadership community. So far we
have seen strong engagement with this initiative.

increased by 80%, from 10 tCO₂e per employee in FY2024
to 18 tCO₂e per employee in FY2025.

The rise in emissions was mainly due to a 2098% increase in
3.2 Capital goods emissions, driven by major office relocations
in London and Tallinn during Q4 FY2025, which we do not
expect to recur annually. Additionally, 3.1 Purchased goods
and services emissions increased by 28% in gross emissions,
reflecting our growing need for professional services. 3.6
Business travel emissions rose by 28% in gross emissions,
but by headcount intensity increased by only 8%.

Scope 3 emissions constitute nearly 100% of our carbon
footprint, with our Scope 1 being 0.1% and our Scope 2 <0.1%,
and with 3.1 Purchased goods and services emissions being
the largest component. As the increase in 3.2 Capital goods
emissions is unlikely to recur, we remain focused on 3.1
Purchased goods and services emissions, as a major
driver of our carbon footprint.

Methodology
Emissions were calculated following the GHG Reporting Protocol (Corporate Standard) using the Watershed platform. For April 2023 – March 2024’s data, the emissions were re-calculated using the
updated emissions from the restatement and using the CEDA methodology. Please read more regarding the restatement on page 46.

4c. Targets used by Wise to manage
climate-related risks and opportunities
and performance against targets
In FY2025, we have decided to retire our net zero 2030 target
due to our reliance on third-party suppliers and vendors which
makes this goal unachievable. Please see more in the
Environment Section on page 45.

Emerging risks
Our vigilance around our risk environment includes monitoring potential risks that could emerge and cause harm or present challenges to our business, our employees and our customers. Emerging
risks are defined as material, highly uncertain risks that do not meaningfully impact Wise today but are unpredictable in nature and could evolve rapidly and unexpectedly. Emerging risks are
managed through the Emerging Risk Forum. This dedicated forum, composed of senior leadership team members, meets bi-annually to review the emerging risks facing Wise. The forum is
responsible for reporting to the ARC on the foremost emerging risks to Wise. The following table summarises discussions at the Emerging Risk Forum under a Political, Economic, Social,
Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) categorisation, highlighting some of the potential emerging threats to Wise’s business interests.

1.   Wise’s Directors believe that, having regard to the nature of the company’s business, the manner in which it is carried on, the financial disclosures required by section (2A)(g) and(h) of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to
     climate targets and related KPIs are not necessary for an understanding of the company’s business (as Wise does not have climate targets). For further information on Wise’s climate programme, please refer to page 45 in the
     Environment section.

Division of responsibilities and governance structure
There is a clear division between executive and non-executive responsibilities. The roles of the Chair and Chief Executive Officer are not held by the same person and their responsibilities are well
defined and set out in writing in the Division of Responsibility Statement, which is available on our website at wise.com/owners/corporate-governance. Day-to-day management of the business and
implementation of the mission is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, who is supported by the Leadership Team.

A summary of the roles and responsibilities of each of our Board members is set out below:

1.   The merger reserve arises from the Group’s pre-listing reorganisation accounted for as a capital reorganisation. Upon the reorganisation, the Group’s Ordinary Shares have been re-presented as those of Wise plc.
     The difference between Wise Payments Limited’s net assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the merger reserve.
2.   Other reserves predominantly relate to investments into highly liquid bonds measured at FVOCI. For these investments, changes in fair value are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. During the year £10.3m
     of fair value gains were recognised in other comprehensive income (2024: £10.9m), including £3.5m of tax charge (2024: £3.5m). Refer to note 10 for further information on the tax recognised on bonds. On disposal of these
     debt investments before maturity, any related balance within the FVOCI reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

Impairment loss
During the financial year, the Group moved or transferred part of its operations into new leased
premises and as part of this tested for impairment the right of use asset and the related leased
office improvements for office space that will no longer be utilised. An impairment loss of
£11.5m (2024: nil) was subsequently recognised from writing down to its recoverable amount
the right of use asset and the related leased office improvements. The recoverable amount
was determined by reference to either the fair value less costs to sell or value in use where
applicable. The impairment loss is included in administrative expenses in the statement of
profit or loss.

 Critical accounting judgement
 Customer balances
 The Group recognises financial assets and corresponding liabilities for the funds
 customers hold in their Wise accounts and the funds the Group receives as part of
 the money transfer settlement process. At the point that the cash is received from the
 customer, the Group becomes party to a contract and has a right and an ability to control
 the economic benefit from the cash flows associated with this balance. Additionally,
 pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have a legally enforceable right to
 set off these financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle them on a net basis
 or settle them simultaneously. Therefore, management has concluded that the recognition
 of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the balance sheet is appropriate.

Alternative Performance Measures


The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting. These measures are not defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable
with the APMs of other companies.

The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing alternative interpretations of the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed
and they are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis and reporting. These APMs should be viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute for, measures presented in the
financial statements which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
