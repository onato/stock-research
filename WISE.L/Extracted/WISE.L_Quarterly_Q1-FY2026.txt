Q1 FY26 Trading Update
17 July 2025


     Strong start to the year with continued cross-border volume and customer growth

    ●​ Quarterly cross-border volume grew +24% YoY (+27% YoY on a constant currency basis),
         to £41.2bn, and Wise customer holdings grew by +31% to £22.9bn
    ●​ 9.8m active customers used Wise in Q1, representing active customer growth of +17% YoY
    ●​ Cross-border take rate reduced by -1bp in the quarter, or -12 bps in the year to 30 June
         2025, to 52bps, reflecting a reduction in our average price together with a continued
         increase in the proportion of higher volume customers in the period
    ●​ Underlying income was £362.0m in Q1 FY26, up +11% YoY on a reported basis and +14%
         YoY on a constant currency basis. Continue to expect strong growth in underlying income
         in FY26, in line with our medium-term guidance of 15-20% on a constant currency basis
    ●​ Remain focused on the long-term growth opportunity and becoming ‘the’ network for the
         world’s money while investing to target an underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16% in
         the medium term, with FY26 expected to be around the top of this range.


“We have had a strong start to our financial year, progressing on our journey to moving trillions with
more people and businesses around the world using Wise. We launched Wise Business in the
Philippines, and we continue to add significant Wise Platform partners. In the first quarter, we
announced a partnership with Raiffeisen Bank, followed by UniCredit in July, to power instant,
low-cost international transfers for their personal and business customers in Europe.


“Last month we also announced our proposal to dual list our shares in the US and the UK, with the
strategic and capital market benefits positively received by Owners. We believe the addition of a
primary US listing will help us accelerate our journey to becoming ‘the’ network for the world’s
money, and ensure our mission and the interests of our customers and Owners remain deeply aligned
over the long term.”
