    Preliminary results for the financial year ended 31 March 2023

WE’RE BUILDING PRODUCTS THAT BRING EVANGELICAL CUSTOMERS TO OUR NETWORK

“At Wise we are laser focused on our mission of money without borders and building the
products that our customers need. Over the past year, we continued to invest in our
infrastructure and launched new features, such as Assets, to make moving and managing
money faster, cheaper, easier, and more transparent for more people and businesses around
the world. Today, 55% of our payments reach their recipient in less than 20 seconds and we
save our customers an estimated £1.5bn1 in fees annually.

“Our strong growth and continued profitability are a direct result of our focus on our mission
and our customers. This year approximately 10 million people and businesses chose Wise to
move and manage their money internationally, an increase of 34% YoY. And in total, we helped
these customers move c.£105bn across borders, up 37% YoY. This growth drove a 51%
increase in revenue and a 73% increase in income 1 for FY2023.”

Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer


Highlights for the twelve months ended 31 March 2023

Strong volume growth is driven by active customer growth
    ● In FY2023 we served c.10 million active customers, an increase of 34% YoY; this is
       underpinned by 66% of customers joining through Word of Mouth and >100% volume
       retention as customers typically stay with us once they join;
    ● This customer growth led to a 37% YoY increase in volumes to £104.5 billion.

It’s our proposition that turns customers evangelical, and it's getting stronger every year
     ● The Wise Account continued to gain traction, with 36% of personal users and 55% of
         businesses now using Wise for more than just sending money internationally;
     ● This year, we launched the Wise “Interest” Assets feature in the UK, SGP and certain
         countries in Europe, and started paying cashback to balance holders in Europe and the
         US;
     ● We expanded the features for businesses around the world, rolling out cards in more
         places, enabling businesses to issue cards to their employees; we also made it easier
         for businesses to accept card payments and manage their expenses using Wise;
     ● We continued to expand our Wise Platform coverage to over 60 partners, giving 25
         million more people and businesses access to our network this year.

55% of payments are instant; powered by our global infrastructure
   ● Part of what customers love is instant payments, and 55% of all cross-border transfers
       were delivered instantly in Q4 FY2023;
   ● This is supported by the launch of instant payments from Singapore to Malaysia, instant
       payments to and from Brazil; and

    ● Integrating new partners, which improved speeds in other countries too, including in
      Japan, Chile and the US.

We’re growing fast, investing efficiently, and profitable
   ● The growth in active customers and volumes, combined with increased adoption of the
       Wise account led to a 51% increase in revenue to £846.1 million;
   ● Higher customer balances and higher interest rates also supported a 73% increase in
       Income to £964.2 million;
   ● Gross profit grew by 73% to £638.2 million, creating more capacity to invest for growth;
   ● Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.7%; higher than last year as our Wise Account features
       drive increased profitability from the higher interest rate environment.

Outlook
   ● We’ll continue to invest in our product and marketing, and we’ll also use interest income
       to offer further incentives, including interest payments, to drive our growth;
   ● We expect Income to grow by between 28-33% in FY2024, and for income to grow by
       more than 20% CAGR over the medium-term;
   ● We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be at or above 20% over the
       medium term, but for it to remain higher than our target in FY2024 due to a higher
       proportion of interest income flowing to adjusted EBITDA.

An update from Kristo, our Co-founder and CEO

We’re solving a massive problem
Our mission is to build money without borders by making the world’s money faster, cheaper,
more convenient and more transparent for people and businesses.

It was 2011 and I’d just been stung by markups hidden in my bank’s exchange rates when
sending a bonus home, resulting in a £500 loss on what was meant to be a £15 fee.

This is just one example of a huge problem that exists around the world for people and
businesses. Hundreds of millions of people and small businesses move £11 trillion every year
across currencies, and this is growing fast. They are effectively being held captive by their
banks through mis-information, receiving a slow, expensive service reliant on an antiquated
system, without being told the price they are actually paying. These people and small
businesses lose around £180 billion in hidden fees each year. This is wrong.

Banking services for international people and businesses don’t really exist, the traditional
solutions disappoint customers. Banks do care and they try, but it’s too hard to build on the
existing infrastructure, which has not evolved in decades.

At Wise we are committed to solving international banking at the fundamental cross border
infrastructure level. For our mission: to build money without borders by making the world’s
money faster, cheaper, more convenient and more transparent for people and businesses.

When we look back over the past 3 years, it’s clear we’ve made great progress. In FY2023, we
completed cross-border transfers for about 9.5 million people and 0.5 million businesses, this
is our mission; delivered to twice as many people and 3x more businesses than in FY2020.

But this only represents c.5% of people and >1% of businesses moving money across borders.
It’s just the beginning and we have a huge underserved audience yet to bring onto our network.

We are building Wise to be a generational company. There are two specific ingredients which
set us on a different trajectory to everyone else serving international customers. First we build
products that turn customers evangelical, and second, we do the hard work to replace the very
infrastructure needed to build the products customers expect; we are building a network for
the world’s money. Let me explain more on each, and our progress.

Our proposition turns customers evangelical, and it’s getting stronger every year.
We made great progress on solving the problems facing customers - our payments are instant
55% of the time, we are radically cheaper than banks, our fees are transparent, and our
products are a delight to use.

Our three core core products, Wise Account; Wise Business; and Wise Platform, bring these
solutions to people, small businesses and other corporations who want to use our network
through our APIs.

I have shared product updates in my quarterly mission updates throughout the year, but below
are some of the improvements we’re especially proud to have shipped.




                                                4
The Wise Account for individuals and Wise Business both offer one account for moving,
holding, and spending any money, anywhere. One of the most exciting developments for these
products has been the expansion of our Assets feature which allows customers to earn interest
on the funds they hold at Wise whilst retaining instant access like a current account.

In Q3 FY2023 we introduced interest earning and government guaranteed assets and rolled
out in the UK and a number of countries in Europe, with a non-government option in Singapore.
In the US and Europe, we also started rewarding customers for the cash balances they hold
with us as we believe offering our customers a fair return on their balances is the right thing to
do, and supports our focus on building a high level of trust and loyalty with our customers. This
is particularly relevant today, given how the interest rate environment has changed over the
last year.

The focus on the customer and building great products turns up in the financial results and
fuels our growth. We have consistently seen around two-thirds of new customers join as a
result of someone having told them about Wise, and these customers tend to stay with us once
they join; we see >100% volume retention. The new features we’re adding are resonating with
our customers. Over a third of all Personal customers and more than half of all Business
customers are using our Account which means they are doing more than just sending money
internationally. These adoption rates are growing quickly too; the majority of new customers
already start with their international account. Where customers use the account beyond
transfers to hold, spend and receive money, they tend to undertake 3x more transactions, and
send 2x more volume cross-border.

This gives me confidence that as we keep offering customers fair, transparent pricing, and
building products customers love, then this flywheel of growth will help us achieve our mission
across the whole market.

But these products couldn’t be built before. They need to be powered by the new
infrastructure.

We’re building the network for the world’s money
Our global infrastructure powers the instant, convenient and low-cost transactions that our
customers and partners rely on, and provides the foundation that enables us to grow at scale.

We believe that the further development of our infrastructure, together with the customers and
partners it attracts, will create substantial network effects and scale advantages over time.

Our infrastructure is a unique combination of components that redefines what’s possible. This
includes:
    - more than 70 banking partners around the world and direct connections to 4 domestic
        payment systems which significantly reduce our unit costs
    - a global treasury management system purpose-built to be real-time, predictive and
        international by default
    - an engine for running the checks and controls needed to ensure regulatory compliance
        and to avoid our service being used for criminal purposes
    - powerful APIs for Wise Platform partners - one single, easy and quick integration
    - 69 regulatory licences around the world

This infrastructure has been neither quick nor easy to build, and that’s what makes it so hard to




                                                5
replicate. We have the largest team of engineers in the world working to solve the problems of
international banking. Over years, they have written more than 6 million lines of code enabling
the integration of banking partners, card partners, payment systems, and platform partners. It
also enables all of the functionality needed for our internal processes to be controlled, scalable
and run in real-time.

Fast payments are core to why customers love us and use us repeatedly, and FY2023 was a
milestone year for payment speeds, with more than 50 percent of all cross border payments
completed instantly (under 20 seconds). To help us pass this milestone, we launched instant
payments from Singapore to Malaysia and we launched instant payments to and from Brazil.

By integrating new partners we were also able to improve speeds in many countries, including
in Japan and Chile. In the US we were able to significantly reduce the average transfer time
from 25 hours to 6 hours.

In the coming year we will be focusing on increasing the number of payments that can be
completed instantly, and we’ve started working on this for India and Poland. We will also keep
working through the improvements we’ve started to speed up financial crime checks and
reduce the number of transfers that get suspended.

Greater speed and efficiency, coupled with greater scale reduces our unit costs. This allows us
to sustainably reduce prices over time while still achieving our targeted margins.

We believe that sharing economic benefits in this way has been fundamental in attracting
customers to Wise, retaining them, and fueling the virality which brings even more customers
to Wise.

A lower unit cost and price also presents any potential competitors or new entrants with a
significant economic challenge to consider, even before they break ground in constructing
their own infrastructure. We believe that operating in this way has been and will continue to be
to the benefit of both customers and owners of Wise.

From time to time, unit costs may temporarily rise and to remain sustainably profitable, when
unit costs rise, so do prices.

This year the average fee paid by customers rose slightly as a result of higher levels of costs
including currency volatility, inflation, and investments to sustainably lower prices more in the
future. While fees on average were higher, we were able to drop prices for some customers,
including those in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and China. We also completely removed fees on same
currency payments in GBP, EUR, SGD and HUF, and we removed fees associated with holding
EUR balances.

Wise Platform is the power of Wise integrated into businesses and banks. I’m really excited
about investing in the long-term potential for our Platform product, which is to serve many
more millions of customers in the most efficient way, including through their own bank.

We took some more steps forward in FY2023, entering 19 new partnerships and expanding our
relationship with a number of existing partners. These new partners have come from all over
the world, and across a range of industries - which really shows the breadth of the potential
here. For example, we onboarded a number of progressive, tech-first enterprises this year that




                                                6
are revolutionising work-flow and financial management for small businesses - including Brex,
Ramp and Bluevine. We also partnered with companies that are making it easier for businesses
to employ people remotely all over the world, and manage their payroll globally - such as
Onfolk, Firstbase and Globalisation Partners.

We have made continued early progress on solving the cross-border problem for more
traditional financial services companies too. We integrated Bank Mandiri, Indonesia’s largest
bank by assets and Interactive Brokers, the global electronic trading platform. In total, around
25 million more people and businesses will now be able to access fast, fair and transparent
cross-border payments through the Wise Platform partnerships completed this financial year.

Across all of our products there is still more work to be done. Our teams will be focused on
making more of the features available to more customers around the world. This will support
not just new customer growth but also active customer growth. And the better the product, the
more we will continue to see our customers recommending Wise.

An exceptional year for financial performance
We’ve only been on this journey for 12 years, and there is a long way to go. Our commitment
therefore is to remain focused on our long term mission, and on delivering the improvements
that will help us solve the problem for more customers around the world.

In FY2023, more customers than ever joined and used Wise. The number of active customers
increased to 10 million this year. This was 34 percent higher than last year, driven by 4.5
million new customers, of which 3 million came as a result of word of mouth recommendations.

These customers converted c.£105 billion with us in FY2023, 37% more than FY2022, and held
almost £11 billion 2 of balances in their Wise accounts at the end of the financial year.

Our Income increased by 73% to £964.2 million, an exceptional level of growth partly due to
£140.2 million of interest income received, which we didn’t fully utilise in the year. Our adjusted
EBITDA almost doubled, to £238.6 million.

This is an exceptional set of financials, continued momentum in customer growth combined
with some specific tailwinds from interest. We expect this customer growth to lead our growth
in the future.

You can read more about our financial performance in Matt’s CFO review below.

Looking ahead to next year
The opportunity is greater than ever. We will continue to focus on making customers
evangelical and building the network for the world’s money and in doing so we’ll continue to
build out this generational company which over the long term will create massive value for
customers and owners alike.

I’m hugely proud and grateful for all the hard work of our Wisers this year, and for your
continued support as owners in supporting us on this mission. Onwards.



Kristo Käärmann

A financial update from Matt, our CFO

We’re building a business with world class fundamentals. First, we have truly customer-led
growth, and we’re growing fast to capture more of a huge market. Second, we have hyper
efficient economics on our growth investments and third, more recently, our Wise Account, is
helping power this growth and higher levels of profitability, that affords us to build a really
compelling proposition.

The increase in active customers is what drives our growth
We have tripled the number of active customers using Wise in just four years. This has been
the primary driver behind an almost 4x increase in cross-border volumes and >5x increase in
Income 3 over that time.

Whilst in line with our ambition, I believe it’s fair to say this was ahead of expectations; and a
result of sustained investment in our infrastructure and products, notably the features and
availability of the Wise Account. This customer growth is underpinned by the appeal and
virality of Wise, with 66% of new customers consistently joining organically through
recommendation, and on average >100% volume retention as customers stick with Wise once
they join.

In FY2023 this continued, with active customers growing by 34%, from 7.4 million to c.10.0
million, supported by the addition of 4.5 million new customers in the year, driving a 37%
increase in volumes to £104.5 billion. Active Personal customers grew 35% to 9.4 million, with
Personal volumes growing by 35% to £76.6 billion. As at the end of FY2023, with an adoption 4
rate of 36%, over a third of all Personal customers are now using the Wise Account, up from
24% a year ago. Active Business customers increased by 27% to 0.52 million, with business
volumes increasing by 43% to £27.9 billion. Volume growth exceeded active customer growth
as our business customers on average moved 13% more, as businesses tend to grow with us.

In aggregate, volume per customer (VPC) has been stable over the long-term but can be more
volatile over shorter periods of time. Personal VPC was unchanged YoY, at £8.1k, but was
higher in the first half of the year, as we saw more customers transacting with larger payments
to take advantage of the strength in the USD. This dynamic weighed on VPC in the second half
of the year, as did a softer macroeconomic environment in which international property
purchases/sales and investment flows were lighter; two common use cases for some of our

higher volume customers. This continued in recent months; as we observe the VPC to be very
slightly lower on Q4FY2023 as we enter FY2024 and expect this trend to continue through
FY2024. Following this, it is only natural that we may also see an uneven growth rate through
FY2024, partly given the nature of the YoY comparisons we will see each quarter (see below
for further detail).

The growth in customers and resulting volumes were the main driver behind the 42% increase
in cross-border transaction revenue to £679.5 million. A 2bps higher cross take rate at 0.65%
also contributed to this increase; with slightly higher prices needed to recover incrementally
higher unit costs due to currency volatility, inflation, and continued investment back into future
growth.

Use of the Wise Account is increasing; other revenue more than doubled to £166.6 million, and
the impact on take rate from ‘’other’ revenue (which primarily consists of interchange income
from cards and fees on the Wise Account) increased from 0.10% in FY2022 to 0.16% in
FY2023.

In total, revenue increased 51% to £846.1 million in FY2023. This includes Personal and
Business segments growing 51% and 50% respectively, and Wise Account adoption more than
doubling other revenue. When we look at our different regions, we see the UK and Europe still
growing fast, but now almost half of revenue is being generated beyond these markets, with
APAC and North America growing 60% and 53% respectively.

And thanks to the Wise Account, we have seen a year of exceptional income growth. The
higher interest rate environment benefited Wise through the interest income we generate on
the cash our customers hold with us. These cash balances increased by 57% to £10.7 billion
(this excludes the customer funds we hold in custody in our Assets product), with 47% being
held by Personal customers and 53% by businesses.

Interest income from these assets increased significantly, from £3.9 million in FY2022 to
£140.2 million in FY2023, representing a gross interest yield of 1.6% and of this, we returned
£18.4m back to customers through balance cashback and other ‘interest like’ benefits. In Q4
FY2023, the gross interest yield was 2.8%, c.1% was used to contribute to the costs of running
the Wise Account and of the remaining 1.8%, around 0.6% was returned to customers.

Combining all of this, Income increased by 73% to £964.2 million in FY2023.

Gross profit grew 73%, which we invest in product, marketing and scaling our operational
capacity
Cost of sales increased by 66% to £308.2 million in FY2023 mostly reflecting the cost of
serving more customers. With a larger customer base who are also increasingly adopting the
Wise Account, we have also seen an increase in other costs more associated with providing an
account, such as costs related to chargebacks and overdrawn balances.

As a result, gross profit increased 73% YoY to £638.2 million for FY2023, representing a gross
profit margin of 66%, unchanged from last year.

Gross profit provides us with the capacity to cover our operating expenses, invest in building a
better experience for our customers and of course provide a healthy and growing stream of
profits to our shareholders. Through reinvestment, we deepen our competitive advantage with




                                                9
infrastructure and products that continually improve, attracting more and more customers
which leads to more gross profit to reinvest, and so the cycle continues.

Administrative expenses for the year increased by 54% to £494.5 million, reflecting increasing
levels of investment as well as the improved onboarding and servicing of a fast growing active
customer base using a more diverse set of features. The majority of this increase represents
the growth in our team with employee benefit expenses increasing 60% to £294.8 million. We
saw a big increase in new customers this year, and we onboarded 4.5 million people and
businesses globally, c.40% more than in FY2022. We made significant improvements in the
service our customers received this year, as such the size of our in-house servicing team
increased by more than 1,200 people to achieve this.

And of course we continued to invest in our product development and marketing teams as we
scale up for our next phase of growth. At 31 March 2023, we had more than 5,100 Wisers
supporting the mission, up from around 3,400 at 31 March 2022.

We grew our investment in marketing by 33% to £37.4 million as we continue to look for ways
to invest more whilst maintaining attractive returns. We continue to operate a disciplined
approach to return on investment for marketing with our payback capped at 12 months for
attracting personal customers and 18 months for businesses. Our blended payback remains
low, and was less than 6 months for FY2023.

Technology and development costs increased by 71% to £42.7 million as we invested in
improving the security and authentication of our products and systems. We’ve also been
increasing our usage of cloud computing, for example through AWS, which gives us a more
flexible way of supporting our growth. Where possible we have been replacing vendors,
looking for better value across our suite of applications.

Expenses relating to consultancy and outsourced services increased by 66% to £70.4 million.
We’re using external vendors more for some operational activities, when we can ensure the
same high quality service but at a lower unit cost. The increase also partly reflects the cost of
advisory services relating to regulatory and compliance requirements as we continue to
broaden our geographic coverage and broaden our products’ features.



Profitable and well capitalised
We generated £238.6 million of adjusted EBITDA in FY2023, a 97% increase YoY. Our adjusted
EBITDA margin for the year was 24.7% (FY2022: 21.8%). This margin increased due to high
levels of interest income, and was 26.9% in H2 FY2023. Profit before tax increased significantly
to £146.5 million, an increase of 234%. Our earnings per share increased by 239% to 11.53
pence.

As at 31 March 2023, we held £11.5 billion of cash and highly liquid investment grade assets,
up 58% from £7.2 billion at the end of FY2022. This includes assets in respect of the £10.7
billion of customer balances which we hold in the form of various high quality assets. It also
includes £671.1 million of our ‘own cash’ (£357.8 million at the end of FY2022), with the
increase driven by the £213.3 million of free cash flow generated by the business (see
definition in appendix). On this basis, our free cash flow conversion rate for FY2023 was 89.4%
(93.3% in FY2022).




                                                10
We are well capitalised for the future and as at 31 March 2023, our Group eligible capital of
£337.8 million was significantly above the minimum capital requirements set by our regulators
around the world. Our capital position, built through sustained profitability, enabled us to
initiate a programme to reduce the dilutive impact on share count that arises through stock
based compensation. £10 million of our capital was used in FY2023 by our Employee Benefit
Trust to fund such share purchases. We intend to continue this programme into FY2024, using
up to an additional £60 million of our capital for this purpose.

These financial results for the year show the value of the great work the teams are doing.
However, scaling across multiple geographies and products is inevitably complex, and comes
with expected challenges.

In August of 2022 the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority found
that our anti-money laundering controls did not meet their requirements and issued a penalty
of US$360,000. No instances of money laundering were identified, and we quickly amended
our controls. This does, however, serve as a reminder of the need to maintain focus on
constantly assessing what is a consistently evolving regulatory and compliance landscape.

During the year we also made significant progress in evolving our control environment, in
particular around controls in our technology but we’ll have more work to do in the coming
years, and this will continue to be a focus as we scale, and requirements from regulators
evolve.

Looking ahead, and our outlook for what’s to come
We’re building a business with world class fundamentals. The approach that has helped us get
this far gives us confidence in doubling down on this approach for the future.

This means we’ll keep investing in product development teams and marketing. We’ll also
continue to sustainably disrupt the cross border transfers market by dropping prices where we
can to delight and build trust in our customers, whilst maintaining a ~20% margin on cross
border volume, and in effect extend the competitive moat we are building around our product,
in a profitable way.

What’s new in the past year is interest income, which we will use to power further profitable
growth through providing a better Wise Account proposition. We intend to invest c.80% of the
interest income back into the Wise Account proposition by paying interest or offering account
related incentives. The remaining c.20% will flow directly to adjusted EBITDA. We will not use
interest to fund general operating expenses, or lower cross border prices; which means we are
building a business which is not dependent on interest income. And as a result of this
approach, adjusted EBITDA margins will be higher whilst we have higher interest rates, and at
the same time, we will be investing significantly in building a more competitive product.

We will provide incentives related to the Wise Account as follows. First, we will use the first c.
1% of yield we earn on customer balances to contribute towards account feature costs, helping
us avoid or reduce any account fees (e.g. subscription, domestic payout fees). This is a level
we believe we can reasonably rely upon over time and through economic cycles. Second, we
will reward customers with interest on their deposit balances: an approach that is live in Europe
and the US. We will extend this to other countries but this will take time. Third, we will explore
other incentives, such as cashback on cards and discretionary fee refunds, especially where




                                                11
we cannot pay interest. Critically, where we cannot reward customers, it will flow to adjusted
EBITDA, which we expect to be the case in the short term.

As for guidance, we expect active customer growth to be the primary driver of income growth
in FY2024, which we anticipate to be between 28-33%. As stated above, we’ve seen the
overall VPC move very slightly lower on Q4 FY2023, as we enter FY2024 and we expect this
trend to continue through FY2024, mindful that there continues to be a soft and uncertain
macroeconomic outlook. This range reflects that we expect to generate more interest income
in FY2024 than in FY2023, and that we should be able to return more to customers.

As we pass through FY2024, it will be important to keep in view that we will be lapping some
unusual trends from FY2023. This includes an exceptional level of volume growth in the first
half of FY2023 and strong interest income growth in the second half.

Over the medium term, we continue to expect income growth of more than 20% (CAGR) and an
adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20%, and per the explanation above, the higher the
interest rates, the higher our adjusted EBITDA margin is likely to be.

And so (nearly) finally
Our results in FY2023 are another proof point that we have truly customer-led growth, and
we’re growing fast to capture more of a huge market. They also demonstrate that the hyper
efficient economics on our growth investments, which include investment into our Wise
Account, are helping power growth and higher levels of profitability.

Finally, as you may know from my announcement in May 2023, I will be moving on from Wise in
early 2024. I will be leaving behind a world class team. This team is building excellent products
for customers as well as building a company, or a machine, with all the processes, principles
and frameworks needed to invest and grow sustainably and profitably over many years to
come.

Note 1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
1.1 General information
Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England. The address of its
registered office is 6th Floor Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JJ. The principal activity of the Company
and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) is the provision of cross-border money transfer services. Further information on the Group’s
operations and principal activities is presented in the Strategic Report of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.

1.2 Basis of preparation
The preliminary results for the year ended 31 March 2023 are an abridged statement of the full Annual Report which was
approved by the Board of Directors on 27 June 2023. The consolidated financial statements in the full Annual Report are
prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in conformity with the applicable legal
requirements of the Companies Act 2006

The auditor’s report on those consolidated financial statements was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way
of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies
Act 2006.

The preliminary results do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies following the Company’s
Annual General Meeting on 7 September 2023.

A separate announcement will be made in accordance with Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) 6.3 when the annual
report and audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 are made available on the Company’s website in
July 2023.

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. All financial information is presented in millions of pounds
sterling (‘£’), which is the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest £0.1m, unless otherwise stated. The financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of particular
financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in note 2.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Preparation of financial statements requires significant accounting judgements and estimates, which have been laid out in
note 3.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the
Strategic report.

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the available
resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.

The going concern assessment is based on the detailed forecast prepared by management and approved by the Board (base
plan). As part of the going concern review, the Directors have considered severe, but plausible, downside scenarios to stress
test the viability of the business. These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and
liquidity as well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Appropriate assumptions have
been made in respect to revenue growth and profitability, based on the economic outlook over the forecast period.
Appropriate sensitivities have been applied in order to stress test the base plan, considering situations with lower revenue
growth and profitability compared to the base plan, where future trading is less than forecasted. Management expects that
sufficient liquidity and regulatory capital requirement headroom are maintained throughout the forecast period.

The Directors have made inquiries of management and considered forecasts for the Group and have, at the time of approving
these financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operations for the
foreseeable future. Further details are contained in the Viability Statement of the Strategic Report.

1.3 Basis of consolidation
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Wise plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2023.

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and are de-consolidated from the
date that control ceases.




                                                                18
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies within the Group are
eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment
of the transferred asset. Group accounting policies are consistently applied to all entities and transactions.

Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the Group from 1 April 2022:

• Amendments to IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use
• Amendments to IFRS 3 – Reference to the Conceptual Framework
• Amendments to IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract
• Annual Improvements to IFRS standards (2018-2020 cycle)

The adoption of the above amendments did not have a material impact on the Group. There are no other new or revised
standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 April 2022 that
would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
The following amendments have been published by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1
January 2023; the amendments have not been early-adopted by the Group:

a. Amendment to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

The amendments, as issued in 2020, aim to clarify the requirements on determining whether a liability is current or non-
current, and apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The IASB has subsequently proposed
further amendments to IAS 1 and the deferral of the effective date of the 2020 amendments to no earlier than 1 January
2024.

It is anticipated that the application of this amendment may have an impact in the Group's consolidated financial statements
in future periods.

b. Other amendments:

• IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts
• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies
• Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Policies
• Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale of contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture

None of these amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or
on foreseeable future transactions.

2.2 Changes in presentation
Interest income and expense on customer balances and benefits paid relating to customer balances
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has made certain presentational changes to better align the relevant IFRS
financial statement captions and reflect the underlying nature of the transactions and operations of Wise.

During the financial year, the balances our customers hold with us have continued to increase. These increasing balances,
coupled with the increase in interest rates globally, has meant that Wise has started generating material interest income on
customer balances, whilst ensuring that they remain safeguarded and available to our customers. As a result of this increased
income, Wise has begun to offer new benefits to its customers for holding their balances in Wise Accounts.

As the results associated with the interest income and the benefits paid relating to customer balances are now material, we
have changed our presentation in the income statement to include within gross profit the revenue (as previously defined) and
the results from customer balances, which includes the interest income and interest expense on customer balances along
with benefits paid relating to customer balances. Benefits paid relating to customer balances was nil in the prior year and so
are not included in the change in presentation table. The net interest income from operating assets will remain unchanged in
terms of presentation, refer to note 2.13.

This change in presentation has been applied retrospectively. The comparative information has been re-presented to reflect
this change in classification for all instances. This change in presentation has no overall impact on operating profit or profit
before tax.

The new accounting policies are as follows:

Interest income on customer balances is earned from holding customer funds (Wise Accounts) as cash and cash equivalents
or investing them into permitted financial assets. These amounts are recognised in the income statement using the effective
interest rate method.

Benefits paid relating to customer balances include incentives and other benefits provided to customers for holding their
balances in Wise Accounts. These are recognised in the income statement in line with the balances held in Wise Accounts
and apportioned over the same period of time.

Interest expense incurred from holding customer balances relate to negative interest rates on euro denominated balances for
some Wise Accounts. Interest expense on customer balances is recognised in the income statement using the effective
interest rate method.

2.3 Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current or non-current classification.

An asset is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

• expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;
• held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period;
• cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the
  reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

• it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;
• it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period;
• there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets
and liabilities.

2.4 Foreign currencies translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. For each entity, the Group determines the
functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.




                                                                    20
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot
rates at the date the transaction is recognised.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss (either as
cost of sales or administrative expenses). Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates if
held at historical cost, or year-end exchange rates if held at fair value, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are
recognised in either the income statement or shareholders’ equity depending on the treatment of the gain or loss on the asset
or liability.

Group companies
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) are translated into pounds sterling as follows:

• assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;
• income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.5 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, on-demand deposits, money market funds (MMFs) and other short-term
high quality liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less, and e-money held with payment processing
partners. Cash that has been paid out from the Group bank account but has not been delivered to the bank account of the
beneficiary is classified as cash in transit. Cash collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties are recognised
under Trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position.

Customer deposits
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities for the funds customers hold on their accounts (‘Wise Accounts’) and the
funds collected from customers, as part of the money transfer settlement process, that have not yet been processed. The
liability is recognised upon receipt of cash or capture confirmation (depending on pay-in method), and is derecognised when
cash is delivered to the beneficiary. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have a legally
enforceable right to set off these financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle them on a net basis, or to settle them
simultaneously.

Principles to determine the point of delivery are the same as applied in revenue recognition, see note 2.11.

The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to customer funds. As
safeguarding requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the Group holds customer
funds in segregated accounts and other high quality liquid assets such as MMFs and investment grade bonds, as allowed by
local regulations.

2.6 Financial assets
Investments and other financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets, at initial recognition, and subsequently measures them at amortised cost, fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL), and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flows and the
Group’s business model for managing them.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that
are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as
the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and
measured at FVOCI, irrespective of the business model.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how they are used in order to generate cash flows. The
business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets,
or both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held with the objective to collect contractual cash
flows, while financial assets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held with the objective of both holding to
collect contractual cash flows and selling.

The Group classifies debt securities (e.g. bonds) as FVOCI pursuant to the above policy as the contractual cash flows are
solely payments of principal and interest, and the objective of the Group’s business model is achieved both by collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. On disposal of these debt investments, any related balance within the
FVOCI reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date according to market conventions. Financial
assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Cash flows in relation to
purchase or sale of these instruments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.

Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL,
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets
carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised costs are subsequently measured using the
effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset
is derecognised, modified or impaired.

Impairment
The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables and uses a simplified approach in
calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For debt instruments held at FVOCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Group
evaluates whether or not the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable
information that is available without undue cost or effort.

In making that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group
considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past
due.

The Group’s debt instruments held at FVOCI consist solely of quoted bonds that are graded in the top investment categories
by Moody’s credit rating agency and, therefore, are considered to be low credit risk investments. It is the Group’s policy to
measure ECLs on such instruments on a 12-month basis. However, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk
since origination, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. The Group uses the ratings from Moody’s both to determine
whether the debt instrument has significantly increased in credit risk and to estimate ECLs.

Refer to notes 2.20 and 4.2 for further information on trade receivables and ECLs.

2.7 Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by
the Group are foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards and non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards. Such
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting date.

All derivative instruments are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair
value is negative. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The
Group enters into derivatives that are due to be realised or settled within 12 months; consequently they are presented as
current assets or current liabilities.

Fair value of a derivative financial instrument is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. When
quoted prices are not available, valuation techniques, that utilise observable inputs, are used to estimate fair value. The key
inputs in the valuation model are the relevant forward exchange rates for the currencies involved.

2.8 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term (1-7 years). Capitalised reconstruction and
internal design costs of leased office space (shown as ’Leased office improvements’ in the notes to the Group consolidated
financial statements) are depreciated over the lease term (typically 2-5 years), and other office equipment over 2 years.

Computer equipment is not recorded in property, plant and equipment but expensed as low-value short-lived equipment in
the Group.

2.9 Intangible assets
Intangible assets predominantly relate to internally generated software, licences and domain purchases.




                                                                  22
Internally generated software
The Group develops software used in provisioning of its services. Development costs that are directly attributable to the
design, development and testing of the software controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the
following criteria are met:

• it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use
• management intends to complete the software
• there is an ability to use the software
• it can be demonstrated that the software will generate probable future economic benefits
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software are available, and
• the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product comprise the software development employee
costs.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development
costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Amortisation
Capitalised development costs, domain and licence purchases are recorded as intangible assets and amortised over their
estimated useful economic lives. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indicator that they might
be impaired, for example when the assets are no longer in use and need to be decommissioned.

The Group amortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for mobile applications which are
amortised over 2 years and licence purchases that are amortised over a period of 2-10 years.

2.10 Trade and other payables
Trade payables consist of obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers on the basis of normal credit terms and do not bear interest. Other payables, which relate to Wise
Accounts and money transfers that have not been processed by the Group at the reporting date, are non-derivative liabilities
to individuals or business customers for money they hold with the Group and do not constitute borrowings.

Payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

2.11 Revenue recognition
The Group primarily generates revenue from money transfers and Wise Account, including conversions and debit card
services.

The Group recognises revenue according to the principles of IFRS 15 using the five-step model:

1.   Identify the contracts with customers
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognise the revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation

A customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time of opening a Wise Account or initiating a money transfer.
Generally, the customer agrees to the contractual terms by formally accepting, on Wise’s website or the App, the terms and
conditions of the respective service, which detail the Group’s performance obligations and fees.

In the case of debit card services, a customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time the card is made available
for use and the customer is able to either make a payment or a withdrawal.

The transaction price is the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for providing services to a
customer. The fees charged to customers are shown to them upfront prior to the transaction being initiated. For international
transfers, a single upfront fee per transaction is charged, consisting of a fixed and a variable amount. The amount of both the
fixed and the variable portion of the fee depends on a number of factors, including the currency route, the transfer size, the
type of transaction being undertaken and the payment method used. Wise offers certain rebates in the form of a fee refund
for eligible transactions. The refund liability is recognised for the expected future rebates at the time of the transaction and
deducted from revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.

The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations of the different revenue streams on the basis of relative
standalone selling prices. As there is typically a single performance obligation associated with each type of service provided
to a customer, the revenue is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied. For money




                                                                 23
transfers it is upon delivery of funds to the recipient. In the case of money conversions it is when a customer balance is
converted into a different currency and for debit card services it is upon transaction capture.

The timing required for the Group to process the payment to the recipient and, hence, to satisfy its performance obligations
largely depends on the processing time its banking partners require to deliver funds to the recipient. Therefore, the revenue is
deferred until the funds are delivered. In certain jurisdictions where the Group has settlement accounts with the Central
Banks or in the case of transfers between Wise Accounts or conversions within a Wise Account, such transactions are fulfilled
instantly.

Other revenue
Wise Assets (‘Assets’), an investment product, allows customers to purchase units in funds provided by fund managers using
their Wise account balance. The Group generates revenue from charging a fee based on the value of the assets under
management. The revenue is accrued on a daily basis and is recognised over time, in line with the period the Group provides
its services to Assets customers.

The Group acts as a matched principal broker and does not retain control nor benefits from the Assets, thus it does not
recognise the financial assets and the respective liabilities for the Assets, and derecognises customer funds on purchase.

As at 31 March the title for the units of three of the funds was held, on the behalf of customers, by a non-dormant Wise entity.
Management performed an analysis to assess whether our accounting policy was therefore still appropriate and it was
concluded that the policy continued to apply for these funds.

2.12 Other operating income
Other operating income relates, predominantly, to other income recognition from contracts with partners and government
grants for qualifying research and development (R&D) activities.

Other income recognition from contracts with partners
Income from contracts with partners is recognised over their contractual terms as the relevant performance conditions are
met. The contracts may contain certain performance conditions and milestones. The Group defers any cash consideration
received up-front until it is probable that these conditions and milestones are met.

Government grants
Government grants recognised in other operating income relate to qualifying UK R&D under the research and development
expenditure credit (RDEC) scheme for large companies. Such grants are taxable and are presented as other operating income
in the consolidated income statement.

2.13 Interest income from operating assets
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method on corporate ‘cash and cash equivalents’.

2.14 Leases
A lease is a contract or part of a contract that conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identifiable asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration.

The Group as lessee
Initial measurement
At the commencement date, a lessee shall recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. At the commencement date, a
lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset at cost. The cost of the right-of-use asset shall comprise:

• the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
• any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;
• any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and
• an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on
  which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

Right-of-use of assets are recorded within the ‘Property, plant and equipment’ line in the statement of financial position and
are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability; they are predominantly related to office spaces leased in various
locations. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined.

If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the
individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset
in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.




                                                                  24
At the commencement date, the lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following
payments for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date:

• fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;
• variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
  commencement date. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate include, for example, payments linked to
  a consumer price index;
• amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
• the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
• payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the
  lease.

Subsequent measurement
After the commencement date, a lessee measures the right-of-use asset estimated by applying a cost model. To apply a cost
model, a lessee measures the right-of-use asset at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses and adjust for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life and the lease term, on a
straight-line basis.

Otherwise, the lessee shall depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the
useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

If there are changes in lease payments, there may be a need to remeasure the lease liability. A lessee shall recognise the
amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. However, if the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, a
lessee shall recognise any remaining amount of the remeasurement in profit or loss.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases and leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value. Payments associated with short-term leases and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a
straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-
value assets comprise IT and office equipment. The total expense, relating to short-term leases to which the lessee
recognition and measurement requirement have not been applied, for the year ended 31 March 2023 is £1.4m (2022: £nil).

The Group presents the payments of principal and interest on lease liabilities as part of financing cash flows.

Extension and termination options
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are
used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. The extension and
termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors.

At the reporting date, the Group is exposed to future cash outflows that are not reflected in the measurement of lease
liabilities. These arise from extension options and a termination option available to the Group for a number of lease
agreements for office spaces. The Group initially assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain it will
exercise the options and subsequently reassesses if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within
its control. The Group has concluded it is not reasonably certain that the options will be exercised.

2.15 Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises the costs that are directly associated with the Group’s principal revenue stream of money transfer,
conversion services and debit card services. This includes:

• banking and customer related fees, including any applicable discounts, incurred in processing customer transfers, as well
  as the card production costs;
• net foreign exchange costs generated due to customer transactions and costs related to the difference between the
  published mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate obtained by the Group in acquiring currency as required. Net
  foreign exchange differences from the revaluation of customer balances at period end are also included. Other product
  costs include product losses that are directly generated from consumer transactions, including chargeback losses, as well
  as taxes directly attributable to customer activity.

2.16 Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically




                                                               25
evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the Group financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is
realised, or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets on share-based payments are recognised for the share options not exercised at the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax assets on share-based payments are determined based on the share price at the balance sheet date. The
impact of recognition is split between income tax expense in profit or loss for the year, for the element up to the cumulative
remuneration expense; and the share-based payment reserve, recognised directly in equity, for the element in excess of the
related cumulative remuneration expense. Refer to note 11 for further details.

The impact of the recognition of deferred tax assets on losses is split between the share-based payment reserve, for the
element of the tax deduction on exercise in excess of the related cumulative remuneration expense, and the income tax
expense in profit or loss for the balance of the loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net
basis.

2.17 Employee benefits
Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and accumulating annual leave, that are expected to be
settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised
in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid
when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.

Long-term obligations
Employee entitlement for long-term leave is recognised as a liability using probability of staff departures and leave utilisation.

Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of employee equity-settled schemes as part of its reward strategy. The fair value of the
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options and awards is recognised in employee benefit expenses
together with a corresponding increase in equity (share-based payment reserves), over the period in which the service and
the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period).

The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and it is recognised over
the vesting period. For non-market-based awards, vesting conditions are included in the assumptions of the number of
options and awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of
options and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the
statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve. For awards
subject to a market-based performance condition, no subsequent adjustments may be made. Upon exercise of share
options, the impact is recognised in retained earnings.

2.18 Employee share trust
The Group provides finance to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either purchase Company’s shares on the
open market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital, to meet the Group’s obligation to provide shares when
employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the consolidated income
statement. Shares held by the ESOP Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares until such time
that employees exercise their awards.

Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity.

2.19 Segment reporting
The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment. This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to, and
regularly reviewed by, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’), which is currently the Board of Directors of the Group.
The Group has therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is the ‘cross border
payment services’. Refer to note 5.




                                                                26
2.20 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from payment processors and collateral deposits the Group
holds with its counterparts. Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost less impairment for expected credit losses. The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9,
which requires expected lifetime credit losses to be recognised from the initial recognition of the receivables. Refer to note
2.5 above for further information on expected credit losses.

2.21 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, after deducting shares held by the ESOP Trust.

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:

• the after-income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares; and
• the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding, assuming the conversion of
  all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the purposes of diluted earnings per share it is assumed that any performance
  conditions attached to the schemes have been met at the balance sheet date.

2.22 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortised
cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest
expense, within the finance expense, in the income statement over the term of the borrowing, using the effective interest
method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred and treated as a transaction cost
when the draw-down occurs. The Group presents the impact of transaction costs as part of financing cash flows.

2.23 Provisions
Provisions are liabilities where the exact timing and amount of the obligation are uncertain. Provisions are recognised when
the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, when an outflow of resources is probable
to settle the obligation and when an amount can be reliably estimated. Where the time value of money is material, provisions
are discounted to current values using appropriate rates of interest. The unwinding of the discounts is recorded in net finance
income or expense.

2.24 Specific allowance for expected credit losses
The Group may recognise specific allowance for individually material financial assets for which credit quality deteriorates
significantly. The Group takes into account specific facts and circumstances that might indicate impairment, such as litigation
risk, credit rating and financial results of the counterparty. The Group also uses the weighted probability method to assess
the recoverability of the amounts and monitors subsequent changes in the assumptions and estimates on a regular basis.

2.25 Legal provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group may become party to litigation proceedings from time to time and recognises a legal provision when a) it has a
present obligation as the result of a past event, b) it is probable the outflow of economic resources will be required to settle
the obligation and c) a reliable estimate of such amount can be made. If these conditions are not met, the Group discloses
contingent liabilities; unless the likelihood of the outflow of the economic benefit is remote.

Note 3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying
disclosures. Uncertainty about these estimates and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:

3.1 Customer balances
The Group recognises financial assets and corresponding liabilities for the funds customers hold on their Wise Accounts and
the funds the Group receives as part of the money transfer settlement process. At the point that the cash is received from the
customer, the Group becomes party to a contract and has a right and an ability to control the economic benefit from the cash
flows associated with this balance. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have a legally
enforceable right to set off these financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle them on a net basis or settle them
simultaneously. Therefore, Management has concluded that the recognition of the financial assets and their respective
liabilities on the balance sheet is appropriate.




                                                                27
3.2 Net gains and losses from foreign exchange differences
The Group classifies net foreign exchange gains and losses from customer transactions, including the costs related to the
difference between the published mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate obtained by the Group in acquiring
currency as required, as cost of sales. The Group considers these costs as directly related to and incurred as part of
providing services to customers. The total net foreign exchange differences recognised in cost of sales for the year ended 31
March 2023 is £24.5m (2022: £13.3m).

Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,
are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated
financial statements were prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they
occur.

Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of estimation.

Note 4. Financial risk and capital management
This note further explains the Group’s exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect the Group’s future financial
performance. Current year profit and loss information has been included where relevant to add context.

In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to the main financial risks: liquidity, credit, and market risk from its use of
financial instruments. The Group’s financial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the
Group’s financial performance.

4.1 Liquidity risk
The Group actively monitors its liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the
Group’s liquidity requirements to make sure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Group’s objective is to
maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of external working capital funding and
corporate funds.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, that it always has enough liquid resources to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the
Group’s position. The Group utilises an internal liquidity adequacy assessment process, incorporating micro- and macro-
economic stress testing to ensure the Group maintains prudent levels of liquid resources at all times to meet both regulatory
requirements and the internal liquidity risk appetite.

The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. The Group has
access to a £300.0m multi-currency revolving facility.

The breakdowns of trade payables and borrowings into current and non-current are shown in notes 18 and 19. See also note
4.5 for the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

4.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations.

Credit risk is managed at Group level and comes mainly from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents held in banks and
investments in bonds. The impairment provisions for financial assets disclosed in note 15 are based on assumptions about
risk of default and expected loss rates.

If a bank or other financial institution has no independent credit rating, the Group evaluates its credit quality by analysing its
financial position, past experience, and other factors.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk by class of financial asset is as follows:
                                                                                                                   2023            2022
                                                                                                                    £m               £m

Due to the short duration of the cash and cash equivalents (less than 3 months), the fair value approximates the carrying
value at each reporting period.

Credit risk is mitigated as financial assets subject to credit risk are held with reputable institutions or in highly rated
financial investments.

4.3 Market risk
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from floating interest rate borrowings (note 19) and manages the potential that
financial expenses increase when interest rates increase. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the interest rate risk.

In a stressed scenario a change of 10 basis points in the interest rates of interest-bearing liabilities at the reporting date
would have changed profit and equity by £0.1m (2022: £0.1m).

Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate movement from holding assets and liabilities in different currencies and
guaranteeing customers a foreign exchange rate on their international transfers for a limited period of time. Wise actively
monitors foreign exchange risk, and exposures are managed through a combination of natural hedging and treasury products
hedging.

At the reporting date, there are open treasury positions of notional contract amounts of £366.2m (2022: £139.7m), with
remaining maturity between 3 to 11 days. The total fair value of those derivative contracts, at the reporting date, is not
materially different from their total fair value at the date those derivative contracts were entered into. Consequently, no
derivative financial instrument is presented in the financial assets or liabilities as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: no
derivative financial instrument is presented in the financial assets or liabilities). The notional contract amounts of those
derivatives held to manage the foreign exchange exposure indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the
balance sheet date. They do not represent amounts at risk. Post balance sheet date all open treasury positions have been
realised or settled.

The table below presents the Group’s net position (difference between financial assets and liabilities) across its main
currencies and the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk at the end of each reporting period.

A 5% strengthening or weakening of GBP against all other currencies, with all other variables being constant, would result in a
foreign exchange loss or gain of £1.7m (2022: £0.8m), excluding the tax effect.

The Group considers a 5% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its
subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

4.4 Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities
and to meet its regulatory capital requirements, both under normal operating environments and stressed conditions.

The Group’s capital comprises ordinary share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital risk are to:

• safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that the Group can continue to provide returns for
  shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;
• maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital;
• adhere to regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction; and
• fund an orderly wind-down in an adverse reverse scenario.

Further information on the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital along with the disclosure requirements under
MIFIDPRU 8, can be found on our Owner relations website: https //wise.com/owners/.

The Group is subject to prudential regulatory consolidation which follows the rules in the sourcebook for MIFID investment
firms (‘MIFIDPRU’). This is due to the existence of TINV Ltd, a group UK FCA-regulated investment firm subject to these rules.

Both TINV Ltd (a MIFID investment firm) and the Group (a MIFID investment group) are classified as Non-small and Non-
interconnected investment firms (‘non-SNI’).

Overall own funds requirement
The Group own funds requirement is subject to the variable own funds requirement that is the highest of :

1.   its permanent minimum capital requirement (i.e. its initial capital requirement);
2. its fixed overheads requirement (‘FOR’); and




                                                                 30
3. its K-factor requirement (‘KFR’).

The Group also follows and adheres to the Overall Own Funds Threshold Requirement as this is derived by the Group’s
Internal Capital Adequacy Risk Assessment (‘ICARA’) and approved by the Board. ICARA is a continuous risk assessment
process which considers the business model implication on capital and liquidity on an ongoing basis pursuant to the guidance
of MIFIDPRU 7.

4.5 Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets mainly consist of cash, short-term trade and other receivables and listed bonds. Its financial
liabilities include trade liabilities and obligations towards financial institutions. All purchases and sales of financial assets are
recognised on the settlement date according to market conventions.

The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

• the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and
• the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) comprise investments into highly liquid bonds
with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group estimates that the fair values of assets and liabilities reported at amortised cost in the statement of financial
position as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 do not materially differ from the carrying amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements.

The carrying amount of current accounts receivable and payable less impairments is estimated to be approximately equal to
their fair value.

IFRS 13 has sought to make measurements at fair value more consistent and comparable by categorising fair value according
to the hierarchy of the inputs used to measure them. These are categorised from Level 1 to Level 3 as follows:

• Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities which the Group can access at the date of
  measurement.
• Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly.
• Level 3 - Inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value by the level in the fair
value hierarchy as at the reporting date:

Financial instruments in level 1
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A
market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry
group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on
an arm’s length basis.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current close price at the balance sheet date.

If the fair value of the short-term financial assets would change by 1% at the reporting date, that would result in a £38.0m
(2022: £11.9m) increase or decrease in the balances and the corresponding impact on the comprehensive income.

Financial instruments in level 2 and 3
Throughout and at the end of the reporting year, the Group had no financial instruments in level 2 and 3, consistent with the
prior year.

Note 5. Segment information
Description of segment
The information regularly reported to the Board of Directors, who are considered to be the CODM, for the purposes of
resource allocation and the assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. Based on the
Group’s business model, the Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is ‘Cross-
border payment services’.

The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the statement
of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of revenue by type of customer and
geographical region, is set out in note 6.

At the end of each reporting period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise Payments Ltd in the UK.
Based on the location of the non-current assets, the following geographical breakdown on non-current assets is prepared:

The Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) before other comprehensive income (OCI) is a 22% charge (2022: 25% charge).

This equates to the applicable UK corporation tax rate of 19%, adjusted for a number of factors such as the change in the rate
of recognition of deferred tax as a result of the UK corporation tax rate change, non-deductible employee option plan costs,
movement in tax provisions and higher overseas tax rates.

On 10 June 2021, an increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% applicable from 1 April 2023 was enacted.
Therefore, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are expected to unwind after 1 April 2023, have been measured in
the current reporting period based on the increased UK corporation tax rate (25%) and reflected accordingly in the statement
of profit and loss and equity.

The deferred tax asset is predominantly generated in the UK and the US and mainly comprises unexercised share options
and losses generated by share-based payment deductions. The deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to
determine recoverability and to determine a reasonable time frame for utilisation. To determine this, the Group uses the
approved Group forecast used for the Viability Statement and going concern analysis. There is no time limit for utilisation of
UK or US tax losses. In addition, the UK and the US have sufficient taxable profits in FY2023 to commence utilisation of
brought forward losses. In light of this analysis, the Group considers it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits in




                                                                   36
the next 6 years to realise the deferred tax asset. Consequently, the Group has unrecognised deductible temporary
differences of £nil (2022: £nil) and the asset has been recognised in full as at 31 March 2022 and 2023.

Software is internally generated intangible asset which consists of capitalised development costs. Other intangible assets
primarily include licences and domain purchases.

In addition to capitalised amounts as software intangible, the Group expensed £91.8m of product engineering costs for the
year ended 31 March 2023 (2022: £59.8m). These costs directly relate to the development of the Group's product offerings
and primarily comprise employee costs of the engineering and product teams, that do not meet the capitalisation criteria.

* Net of expected credit loss provision of £31.5m as at 31 March 2023 (2022: £19.8m). The movement in the year is predominantly related to
  increased activity and the corresponding increase in customer balances; this resulted in the increase of overdrawn customer’s balances older
  than 30 days. Customer chargebacks increased by £1.2m to £4.1m at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: £2.9m) and overdrawn accounts
  increased by £17.9m to £27.4m (31 March 2022: £9.5m). During the year, the recognised specific provision for the receivables with MS Bank
  S.A. Banco de Câmbio was utilised (2022: specific provision of £7.4m).

The carrying values of current trade receivables approximate their fair values because these balances are expected to be
cash-settled in the near future unless a provision is made.

The interest expense accrued is recognised within finance expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Revolving credit facility (RCF)
The Group has access to a multi-currency debt facility of £300.0m with a maturity date in 2025 and two 1-year, extension
options. The RCF is a multi-bank facility with Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited (‘SVB UK’), Citibank N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank
N.A., National Westminster Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding.

The facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to SONIA plus a margin determined by reference to adjusted leverage
(calculated as a ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA). The agreement contains certain customary covenants, including to
maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio not in excess of 3:1 and interest cover (calculated as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA
to finance charges in accordance with the terms of the agreement) not less than a ratio of 4:1 in respect of any relevant
period.

The Group monitors compliance with the covenants throughout the reporting period. On 31 March 2023, the Group was in
breach of a representation in the RCF Agreement, which meant that further draw-downs and roll-overs of credit were
temporarily suspended. This technical breach was waived by lenders before the date of signing these financial statements
and the facility was fully resumed. As a result of this technical breach on 31 March and the future intention of the Group to
use the facility primarily for short-term funding, the facility has been recorded as a current liability on the balance sheet. The
Group has complied with all financial covenants for this and all reporting periods. The undrawn amount of the facility as at 31
March 2023 was £50.0m (2022: £132.0m).

The facility is secured by certain customary security interests and pledges including over shares in certain Group entities
(Wise plc, Wise Financial Holdings Ltd, Wise Payments Limited, Wise US Inc., Wise Europe SA and Wise Australia Pty Ltd), and




                                                                40
fixed and floating pledges over assets and undertakings of Wise Payments Ltd, excluding customer and partner funds, share
capital or equity contributions maintained for regulatory purposes, cash paid into a bank or collateral account in connection
with, and for the benefit of, relevant card scheme providers and assets held in safeguarded accounts or otherwise
segregated for regulatory purposes.

Lease liabilities
As at 31 March 2023, the lease liabilities are £14.5m (2022 £17.2m) and relate to the expected terms remaining on UK, US,
Estonia, Hungary, Singapore, Belgium and Brazil office space leases discounted at between 2.21% and 15.75%. The leases
expire between 2023-2029.

The Group has an extension option in an office lease, which has not been exercised as at 31 March 2023. The potential future
lease payments, should the Group exercise the extension options, would result in an increase in the lease liability of £1.0m.

The Group has a termination option in an office lease, which has not been exercised as at 31 March 2023. The potential future
lease payments, should the Group exercise the termination option, would result in a decrease in the lease liability of £1.4m.

During the year, the Group allotted 87,396 class A Ordinary Shares of £0.01 related to customer shareholder programme
(2022: 82,736,034 class A Ordinary Shares of £0.01 related to employee share options awards).

Each Class A Ordinary shareholder is entitled to one vote for each Class A Ordinary Share held, subject to any restrictions on
total voting rights as set out in the Company's Articles of Association. Class A Ordinary shareholders are entitled to interim or
annual dividends to the extent declared and do not hold any preferential rights to dividends. Class A Ordinary Shares are non-
redeemable.

Each Class B shareholder is entitled to nine votes for each Class B Share held, subject to any restrictions on total voting rights
as set out in the Company's Articles of Association. Class B Shares carry no rights to distributions of dividends except on
distribution of assets, up to their nominal value, on a liquidation or winding up. Class B Shares are strictly non-transferable,
non-tradable and non-distributable to any person or entity whatsoever.

Note 21. Equity merger reserve and other reserves
Equity merger reserve
As disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, the Class A Shares of the Company were admitted to trading on the
London Stock Exchange on 7 July 2021. The merger reserve arises from the Group pre-listing reorganisation accounted for as
a capital reorganisation. Upon the reorganisation, the Group's Ordinary Shares have been represented as those of Wise plc.
The difference between Wise Payments Ltd net assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the merger
reserve.

Other reserves
Other reserves predominantly relate to investments into highly liquid bonds measured at FVOCI. For these investments,
changes in fair value are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. On disposal of these debt investments, any
related balance within the FVOCI reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. Comparative figures include £4.8m net loss on
disposal of a number of listed bonds, that was transferred from other reserves in equity to other operating expenses in the
consolidated income statement. No debt investments were disposed during the year.

Note 22. Own share reserve
In January 2023, Wise announced the intention of the Employee Benefit Trust to acquire up to £10.0m of Wise shares in the
market in order to reduce the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. As of 31 March 2023, a total of 1,776,098
shares were purchased from the market at an average of £5.63 per share. Directly attributable costs of £0.1m have been
expensed to equity.

Note 23. Share-based employee compensation
The employee share schemes are designed to provide long-term incentives for all employees to deliver long-term
shareholder returns. Under the plans, participants are granted share awards of the Company, which vest gradually over a 4-
year period and are equity settled for shares within Wise plc. The awards are subject to service conditions, i.e. the
requirement for recipients of awards to remain in employment with the Group over the vesting period. During the year, an
award was granted that its vesting is conditional on achievement of the relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared to
the FTSE 250 and volume growth performance measures over the 3-year performance period.

Transactions on the share schemes for employees during the year were as follows:

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in 2023 was £4.98 (2022: £8.76).



Valuation of share awards
The assessed fair value at the grant date of share awards granted during the year ended 31 March 2023 was £5.12 per
option on average (2022: £9.51). The fair value of the share awards granted is calculated using the closing share price at the
grant date.

The fair value of the share options granted prior to the listing was independently determined using the Black-Scholes model
that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the share option, the share price at grant date and expected price
volatility of the underlying share, the risk-free interest rate for the term of the share option and the correlations and volatilities
of the peer group companies.

The Black-Scholes model inputs included:

• Options are granted for no consideration and vest over the 4-year period according to the vesting conditions
• Average exercise price: £0.01




                                                                 42
• No dividends are expected to be paid
• Expected price volatility of the Company’s shares: 48%
• Risk-free interest rate: 1.44%
• Expected price volatility is based on the comparative information of the peer-group companies


Risk-free interest rate is based on the UK 5-year government bond yield.

Share trust
The Group consolidates one share trust. The Group’s own share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares in
the Wise Group Employee Benefit Trust (Ocorian) which are held for the purposes of fulfilling obligations in respect of the
Group’s share awards.

Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting. These measures are
not defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable with the APMs of other companies.

The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing alternative
interpretations of the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed and they are used by the Directors and
management for performance analysis and reporting. These APMs should be viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute
for, measures presented in the financial statements which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

 Income                      Income is defined as revenue plus interest income on customer balances,      See definition for
