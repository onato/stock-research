we’re solving
a massive
problem
                                           Kristo Käärmann
                                           Co-founder and CEO
                                           Twelve years ago we set out to solve
                                           the massive problem people and
                                           businesses face in sending money
                                           around the world. Today, roughly 5%
                                           of the cross-border money moved by
                                           people goes through Wise and for small
                                           businesses this is approaching 1%.
                                           This means over the past year we
                                           saved our customers c.£1.5 billion*
                                           in fees compared to banks.

                                           But today our customers need us for
                                           much more. This is why we built a
                                           single account that people and
                                           businesses can use to send, spend,
                                           receive and hold money in multiple
                                           currencies.

                                           Powered by our underlying
                                           infrastructure, Wise Account and Wise
                                           Business now give people and
                                           businesses a comprehensive way to
                                           move and manage money
                                           internationally. At the same time, banks
                                           and businesses can also use Wise
                                           Platform to offer their own customers
                                           the same experience seamlessly.

                                           While we're nowhere near mission
                                           complete, 16 million people and
                                           businesses are now helping us to get
                                           closer every day.

How the Wise Account supports
international athletes
Alexander followed in his father’s footsteps to play, and now
coach, American football. Dedicating his life to chasing his
passion he first began the journey of pursuing his dream in
California, before moving to a team in Rome and falling in love
with Europe.

Using the Wise Account, he often transferred money back
home to his family while working and travelling, making sure
to get the best rate on his Euro to Dollar exchanges.

Alexander then migrated to Germany continuing to pursue his
travel and sporting goals. After suffering an injury in 2012, he
moved into football coaching, and further relocated to
Norway.

Now settled in Switzerland, he is a prime example of an expat
who lives truly internationally; crossing borders and
touchlines in equal measure.

Throughout his adventures, the Wise Account has also
supported Alexander’s day to day spending and living,
allowing him to hold all the currencies he needs in one place.


“It’s changed the game in terms of
 simplicity, and certainly been a
 lifesaver for expat living”                                       Watch the story of this globe

Moving money

People and businesses                       More people and businesses are becoming international and
                                            the need to move and manage money is growing. The market

move over £22 trillion                      continues to get bigger driven by both an increase in
                                            international mobility and international trade. Globalisation,
around the world every                      increased migration and rapid technological developments
                                            are all underlying drivers contributing to growth in the
year but pay significant                    cross-border market.


fees, often unknowingly,                    The market for cross-border transfers alone is estimated
                                            at £22 trillion in 2021 and is expected to reach £28 trillion
for a slow service.                         by 2027 according to strategic payments consultant Edgar,
                                            Dunn & Company (EDC).
That’s why we’re here.                      This includes a broad set of use-cases such as remittances,
                                            e-commerce card payments, real estate investments and
                                            tuition bills, cross-border payments of salaries and suppliers,
                                            and payments for merchandise and services from abroad.

                                            But the market is dominated by banks that provide an
                                            expensive, slow and inefficient service, reliant on outdated
                                            infrastructure. Fees are kept high to cover the costs
                                            associated with this intermediary-heavy network which
                                            is unreliable, hard to monitor and has manual or semi-
                                            automated processes. Further, the lack of transparency
                                            on fees means that there are limited pressures to solve this
                                            problem from within. Some new entrants are bravely trying
                                            to solve these problems.

                                            We have spent the last 12 years building a replacement
                                            infrastructure for correspondent banking and have already
                                            made great progress in fixing the important problem of
                                            moving money across borders faster, cheaper, easier and
                                            more transparent.

    Direct connections
    In some of the countries where we operate, we have
    a direct connection into the domestic payment
    infrastructure, which means that we don’t need
    to use local partner banks to receive or complete
    payments. We have direct connections in the UK,
    Hungary and Singapore. In Europe, we are an
    addressable BIC holder, enabling us to submit and
    receive payments within the Single Euro Payments
    Area (SEPA).

    By connecting directly into payment systems, we are
    able to make meaningful cost reductions and then
    pass this through to our customers. Generally,
    payments are also much faster. For example, when            Diana Avila, Global Head of Banking and Expansion
    we connected to the Faster Payments System in the
    UK we were able to reduce our bank costs by 9x,
    and we saw a c.96% reduction in payment time.
    After integrating with the Hungarian central bank
    we were able to reduce prices on average by 14%
    and 82% of our transfers to Hungary became instant
    (from 17% before integration).

30   Wise Annual Report and Accounts 2023
We’re building the network
for the world’s money
Our global infrastructure powers the instant, convenient and
low-cost transactions that our customers and partners rely on,
and provides the foundation that enables us to grow at scale.

We believe that the further development of our infrastructure,
together with the customers and partners it attracts, will create
substantial network effects and scale advantages over time.

Our infrastructure is a unique combination of components that
redefines what’s possible. This includes:

• more than 70 banking partners around the world and direct
  connections to 4 domestic payment systems which
  significantly reduce our unit costs
• a global treasury management system purpose-built
  to be real-time, predictive and international by default
• an engine for running the checks and controls needed
  to ensure regulatory compliance and to avoid our service
  being used for criminal purposes
• powerful APIs for Wise Platform partners – one single, easy
  and quick integration
• 69 regulatory licences around the world

This infrastructure has been neither quick nor easy to build, and
that’s what makes it so hard to replicate. We have the largest
team of engineers in the world working to solve the problems of
international banking. Over years, they have written more than
6 million lines of code enabling the integration of banking
partners, card partners, payment systems, and platform partners.
It also enables all of the functionality needed for our internal
processes to be controlled, scalable and run in real-time.

Fast payments are core to why customers love us and use
us repeatedly, and FY2023 was a milestone year for payment
speeds, with more than 50 percent of all cross border
payments completed instantly (under 20 seconds). To help
us pass this milestone, we launched instant payments from
Singapore to Malaysia and we launched instant payments to
and from Brazil.

By integrating new partners we were also able to improve
speeds in many countries, including in Japan and Chile. In the
US we were able to significantly reduce the average transfer
time from 25 hours to 6 hours.

In the coming year we will be focusing on increasing the
number of payments that can be completed instantly, and
we’ve started working on this for India and Poland. We will
also keep working through the improvements we’ve started
to speed up financial crime checks and reduce the number
of transfers that get suspended.

Greater speed and efficiency, coupled with greater scale
reduces our unit costs. This allows us to sustainably reduce
prices over time while still achieving our targeted margins.

See the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conversion factors (https://www.gov.uk/government/
collections/government-conversion-factors-for-company-reporting) for assistance converting these emissions sources to
quantities of energy consumption.

Methodology: Emissions were calculated following the GHG Reporting Protocol (Corporate Standard) using the Watershed
platform. Energy usage data was collected or estimated based on building square-footage for all facilities, and was combined
with emissions factors from the US EPA, Ecoinvent, TCR and other data sources to calculate GHG emissions. Electricity
emissions factors are chosen based on geography to reflect the emissions intensities of the facilities’ local grid.


Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) disclosure statement
In consideration of our obligations in respect of climate-related disclosures under the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing
Rules, we are building out our processes for identifying, managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities
in line with the TCFD Recommendations.

In terms of governance, our Board has oversight via an annual update on ESG opportunities and strategy, and management has
a role by way of regular updates from an active internal cross-team advisory committee focused on ESG opportunities and risks
and overseen by a full-time ESG Manager. For metrics, the table below sets out further detail on our Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon
emissions. These have been measured by Watershed, an industry specialist in carbon footprint measurement, management and
reporting who has partnered with us since 2019. Watershed uses the World Resources Institute GHG Protocol Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard, which provides a standardised approach for presenting emissions. All relevant Scope 1, 2
and 3 activities are analysed in our carbon footprint.

The group does not fully align with all TCFD Recommendations and Disclosures yet. Our aim is to provide enhanced TCFD-related

     How does the Group engage with
     suppliers?
     • Wise engages regularly with existing suppliers to
       ensure open dialogue and to maintain relationships.
       To ensure high standards are maintained we conduct
       continuous due diligence, and request feedback
       from suppliers.
     • We also have a dedicated Third-Party Management
       (TPM) team to handle the onboarding of new suppliers.
       The TPM team carries out due diligence on all suppliers,
       covering privacy, security and compliance, as well as an
       assessment of whether the supplier or its supplier chain
       has a heightened risk of modern slavery. The TPM team
       also manages and supports the remediation of any risks
       that may arise as a result of our supplier relationships.
       Similarly, we engage with any due diligence processes
       that our suppliers conduct at their end.

The risks we face at Wise


As a global provider of financial services our operating
environment is dynamic, causing our risk landscape
to constantly evolve as we build and operate products
to achieve our mission. This requires our risk strategy
to be nimble and our frameworks to be adaptive
to the challenges we face. We manage or accept
risk appropriately considering our size and
stakeholder impact.

                              Our approach to risk is defined by the Wise Enterprise Risk
                              Management Framework (ERMF), which helps us identify,
                              manage, report and govern our risks. We use this framework
                              to guide us, along with the following key principles it is
                              grounded in:

                              • Proactive identification, assessment and management
                                of risk in alignment with the Group’s mission;
                              • Implementation of a 3LOD model that includes strong
                                accountabilities across the organisation; and
                              • Alignment of our risk management strategy to our mission
                                and core values is critical to success.

                              Our ERMF underpins our mission, with our risk vision and
                              strategy acting as a key enabler in how we achieve this.
                              Further frameworks and structures (such as governance,
                              3LOD and our risk appetite policies and reporting) identify,
                              record, manage and monitor our risks.

Across FY2023, we continued to make a significant commitment to uplifting our global risk maturity across our key regions.
We have done this by maintaining focus on initiatives in key areas across our Risk Management Framework and our approach
to risk. These changes have enabled an uplift in the reporting across the business to our Leadership Team (LT) and Board, affording
us the opportunity to better understand key areas requiring management focus through improved tracking and indicators.

of risk (for example during periods of high volatility). Our ability
to manage these risks, and their resulting costs, has a direct
link to our ability to reduce prices and offer better services
to customers.
As Wise continues to expand into new product currencies
and jurisdictions, this exposes us to new forms of FX risk.
In the same regard, as the level of customer funds we hold
continues to increase, this requires a more complex and
sophisticated approach.
To manage our market risk, and the impact these risks have
on our business, we set an FX risk appetite using a maximum
one-day expected loss model and absolute currency exposure
levels. We use dynamic FX hedging throughout the day and
can also set product limits. Where we cannot hedge a currency
directly we will hedge with other currencies.
We set risk FX thresholds and appetites which help us to
monitor risk levels. If our level of risk surpasses thresholds,
this leads to escalation via defined management actions.

credit risk exposures mainly arise from the placement of
customer and corporate funds with partner banks and
counterparties, as either cash deposits or investments or
receivables arising from the receipt of customer funds by
partners. In an event of default by one or more of these
counterparties, there is a risk that Wise will suffer financial
losses as the funds might become unrecoverable.
To mitigate credit risk, Wise partners with high-quality
counterparties, including banks and non-bank institutions.
Generally, Wise relies on available public credit ratings issued
by internationally recognised credit rating agencies to assess
the credit quality of our partners as part of the initial due
diligence and ongoing review process.
For counterparties without such public credit ratings, Wise
is introducing a process for credit assessments performed
through an internal rating process, using available financial
and other information or referring to external consensus ratings
if available. Credit risk exposure is monitored at a counterparty
level and overall against our risk appetite. This is then reported
as part of the internal risk governance process.

customers, and eventually expanding to more customers) we
seek to reduce the impact of releases and allow for quick

a dedicated team monitoring how our contact rate (when
a customer has to get in touch with us) is impacted to ensure
we quickly understand where our areas of higher risk exist.

telling us.

Changes to the Board
In the period between 31 March 2023 and the date of this
report, the Board appointed Elizabeth Chambers as an
Independent Non-Executive Director.


The Chair
The Chair, David Wells, is considered by the Board to be
independent on appointment. Wise is therefore compliant
with provision 9 of the UK CGC.


Senior Independent Director
In the period between 31 March 2023 and the date of this
report, the Board appointed Clare Gilmartin as SID. Given
Clare’s experience and knowledge of both the Wise Group
and the Board, the Nomination Committee was pleased
to endorse her appointment.


Independence
As at 31 March 2023, 57% of our Board, not including the
Chair, comprised independent NEDs, and we are therefore
compliant with provision 11 of the UK CGC. The appointment
of Elizabeth Chambers on 19 April 2023 increased this
proportion to 63%. The Board considered such Directors
to be independent in character and judgement and free from
relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could
appear to affect, the Director’s independent judgement.

One of our NEDs, Alastair Rampell, is not considered
independent under the UK CGC. However, given Alastair’s
prior experience with Wise Group, the Board believes that
it is in the best interests of the Company for him to remain
on the Board.

Our focus this year has been on reviewing and approving the

respect to the external audit for FY2023, the ARC reviewed
and approved the audit plan and the audit testing plan. During
the course of FY2023, the ARC also reviewed other financial

The ARC continued to provide oversight on embedding our
risk management strategy with particular interest in reviewing
financial crime risk, operational risk, regulatory engagement
and the Group’s IT and general control environment. The ARC
was pleased to see the maturing and evolution of risk culture
across the Group, including increased risk awareness across
the first line of defence.

As Chair of the ARC, I also led an ARC effectiveness review
and we are now in the process of implementing the actions
that were identified to continue to improve the operation
of the ARC. These actions include making improvements to
meeting materials.

Provision of non-audit services by the external
auditor
The ARC is responsible for setting, reviewing and monitoring
the appropriateness of the provision of non-audit services
by the external auditor. Our Group policy permits the
provision of permitted audit-related services and permitted
non-audit services, as specified in the FRC Revised Ethical
Standard 2019, with the prior approval of the ARC or Group
Finance, when acting within delegated limits.

The main aims of this policy are to:

• ensure the independence of the auditor in performing the
  statutory audit; and
• avoid any conflict of interest by clearly detailing the types
  of engagements that the auditor can and cannot undertake.

During the year, PwC were engaged to provide a total
of £534k in non-audit services. These services were those
required by legislation or closely linked to regulation such
as CASS and Safeguarding.

 Governance        Remuneration Committee report continued




Consideration of the UK Corporate Governance Code principles
Our Remuneration Policy has been designed taking into account the following principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code:


Clarity                  • The Remuneration Policy is designed to be simple and support long-term, sustainable performance.
                         • The Remuneration Policy is in line with UK listed company practice.
                         • The Remuneration Policy clearly sets out the elements of remuneration that may be used, the limits in terms
                           of quantum and the discretions which could be applied if appropriate.

Simplicity               • Our remuneration structures are as simple as possible and market-typical, whilst at the same time
                           incorporating the necessary structural features to ensure strong alignment to performance and strategy
                           and minimise the risk of rewarding failure.
                         • The details of each element are clearly set out in the Remuneration Policy.

Risk                     • The Remuneration Policy has been shaped to discourage inappropriate risk-taking through a weighting
                           of incentive pay towards long-term incentives. Additional measures include:
                            • When considering performance measures and target ranges, the Remuneration Committee will take
                              account of the associated risks and liaise with the Audit and Risk Committee as necessary.
                            • Post-vesting holding periods to encourage a long-term, sustainable mindset.
                            • Enforceable malus and clawback provisions across all variable incentive plans.
                            • No Executive Director or other member of management is present when their own remuneration is under
                              discussion.

Predictability           • The potential reward outcomes are easily quantifiable and are set out in the illustrations provided in the
                           Remuneration Policy.
                         • Performance can be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure there are no surprises in outcomes at the end
                           of the performance period.

Proportionality          • Incentive outcomes will be contingent on successfully meeting stretching performance targets aligned
                           to the delivery of the Company’s strategy.
                         • The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to override formulaic outturns.

Alignment to culture     • The Remuneration Policy encourages long-term shareholding, which is aligned with Wise’s culture
                           and mission.
                         • Measures used in the variable incentive plans will be selected to reflect the KPIs of the business.

Legacy incentives held by our Executive Directors, including awards granted in the

Shares under the Legacy Incentive Plans which were operated by the Company prior to Admission. These awards were not
accelerated as a result of Admission, and so remain outstanding subject to service-based vesting conditions.

1. For FY2022, remuneration is reported in respect of qualifying services with the Company from the date the Company was incorporated
   (18 February 2021) or, if later, the date of appointment as a Director of the Company.
2. Alastair Rampell has voluntarily waived all fees in relation to his appointment as a NED of the Company.
3. Hooi Ling Tan, Clare Gilmartin and Ingo Uytdehaage received fees of £1 from 1 April 2022 to 28 February 2023.


Payments for loss of office (audited)

Payments to former Directors (audited)
There were no payments to past Directors during FY2023.


Matthew Briers’ leaving arrangements
As set out earlier in this report on page 28, Matt will step down from his position at Wise in early 2024, voluntarily extending his
notice period in order to ensure a smooth transition period and provide critical support during our CEO’s upcoming sabbatical.
Matt will receive his salary and any pension and benefits payments to which he is entitled until the cessation of his employment
with the Group.

Matt will be treated as a good leaver in respect of his FY2023 and FY2024 PSP awards to reflect his contribution to Wise during
his employment as well as the context for his departure. His PSP awards will vest in line with the normal vesting date (on a
pro-rata basis to reflect the percentage of the performance period Matt is employed), to the extent the performance conditions
attached to the award are fulfilled. The two-year post-vesting holding period will continue to apply. In addition, Matt's pre-IPO
share options award will vest on a pro-rated basis until his last day of employment.

Matt will also be subject to a two-year post-employment shareholding requirement. This will cover all shares and share options
acquired through Wise share plan awards prior to his final date of employment, including his Legacy Incentive Plan awards.
In line with the Policy, the post-employment shareholding requirement equals the lower of Matt’s shareholding at the point
of him leaving the Company or 300% of his salary.

Change in remuneration of Wisers and Directors
The table below sets out how the change in reported remuneration for each Director between FY2022 and FY2023 compares
to the change in average pay for employees of Wise Payments Limited, where the majority of our UK colleagues are employed.
No Directors or employees currently receive annual bonuses.

The relevant regulations prescribe that the above comparison should include all employees of the Parent Company. However,
since there are no individuals employed by Wise plc except for the Executive Directors, a representative comparison has instead
been formulated using all UK-based employees of Wise Payments Limited as the basis for this calculation. The average change
for all employees has been calculated on a full-time equivalent basis, by reference to pay received for the full FY2022 and
FY2023 (excluding any share award vesting). The salary increase includes changes made through the annual salary review
as well as additional changes made throughout FY2022 and FY2023, for example reflecting promotions or role changes.
The change to the level of taxable benefits has been driven by higher average take-up of the benefits offering in FY2023
compared to FY2022 and an increase in our UK medical benefit premium.

                                                                                                        Salary/fees (% change)1   Benefits (% change)2

   a notional amount for the period of FY2022 before Admission on 7 July 2021. The table reports on full-time equivalent figures for Executive
   and Non-Executive Directors.
2. The benefits increase for Kristo Käärmann is reflective of a one-off payment made to Kristo to cover benefit in kind taxes of £898. The benefits
   offered to Executive Directors have not changed in FY2023 versus FY2022. There were no taxable benefits paid to Non-Executive Directors
   during the year.
3. Terri Duhon joined the Board on 1 January 2022. Her fee for FY2022 has been calculated on an FTE basis for the purpose of this comparison.
4. Alastair Rampell has voluntarily waived all fees in relation to his appointment as a NED of the Company.
5. The significant change in fees for Non-Executive Directors is driven by transitioning all Wise NEDs to the Policy fee structure. David Wells,
   Ingo Uytdehaage, Clare Gilmartin and Hooi Ling Tan received a nominal fee of £1 per annum up to 28 February 2023 as remuneration for their
   duties for the Company. After such date, David Wells’ fee increased to £275,000 per annum (as Chairman) and fees for Ingo Uytdehaage,
   Clare Gilmartin and Hooi Ling Tan increased to £170,000 per annum. This is in line with the Chair fee and Non-Executive Director fees set out
   in the Policy, which can be found on page 119.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy;
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments
we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Recognition of deferred tax assets, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because the Group has
established a precedent for forecasting recoverability of tax losses and the degree of judgement in determining the quantum
of deferred tax assets has decreased. Otherwise, the key audit matter below is consistent with last year.

Notes to the Group
consolidated financial
statements
For the year ended 31 March 2023


Note 1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
1.1 General information
Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England. The address of its registered office
is 6th Floor Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JJ. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
‘Group’) is the provision of cross-border money transfer services. Further information on the Group’s operations and principal activities
is presented in the Strategic Report.

1.2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting
Standards in conformity with the applicable legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. All financial information is presented in millions of pounds sterling
(‘£’), which is the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest £0.1m, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of particular financial instruments, to
the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in note 2.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Preparation of financial statements requires significant accounting judgements and estimates, which have been laid out in note 3.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the
Strategic report.

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the available
resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.

The going concern assessment is based on the detailed forecast prepared by management and approved by the Board (base plan).
As part of the going concern review, the Directors have considered severe, but plausible, downside scenarios to stress test the
viability of the business. These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and liquidity as well as
the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Appropriate assumptions have been made in respect to
revenue growth and profitability, based on the economic outlook over the forecast period. Appropriate sensitivities have been applied
in order to stress test the base plan, considering situations with lower revenue growth and profitability compared to the base plan,
where future trading is less than forecasted. Management expects that sufficient liquidity and regulatory capital requirement
headroom are maintained throughout the forecast period.

The Directors have made inquiries of management and considered forecasts for the Group and have, at the time of approving these
financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operations for the foreseeable
future. Further details are contained in the Viability Statement of the Strategic Report.

1.3 Basis of consolidation
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Wise plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2023.

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and are de-consolidated from the date
that control ceases.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies within the Group are eliminated on
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred
asset. Group accounting policies are consistently applied to all entities and transactions.

Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the Group from 1 April 2022:

• Amendments to IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use
• Amendments to IFRS 3 – Reference to the Conceptual Framework
• Amendments to IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract
• Annual Improvements to IFRS standards (2018-2020 cycle)

The adoption of the above amendments did not have a material impact on the Group. There are no other new or revised standards or
interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 April 2022 that would be expected to
have a material impact on the Group.

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
The following amendments have been published by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2023; the amendments have not been early-adopted by the Group:

a. Amendment to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

The amendments, as issued in 2020, aim to clarify the requirements on determining whether a liability is current or non-current, and
apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The IASB has subsequently proposed further amendments to
IAS 1 and the deferral of the effective date of the 2020 amendments to no earlier than 1 January 2024.

It is anticipated that the application of this amendment may have an impact in the Group's consolidated financial statements in
future periods.

b. Other amendments:

• IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts
• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies
• Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Policies
• Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale of contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture

None of these amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or on
foreseeable future transactions.

2.2 Changes in presentation
Interest income and expense on customer balances and benefits paid relating to customer balances
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has made certain presentational changes to better align the relevant IFRS financial
statement captions and reflect the underlying nature of the transactions and operations of Wise.

During the financial year, the balances our customers hold with us have continued to increase. These increasing balances, coupled
with the increase in interest rates globally, has meant that Wise has started generating material interest income on customer balances,
whilst ensuring that they remain safeguarded and available to our customers. As a result of this increased income, Wise has begun to
offer new benefits to its customers for holding their balances in Wise accounts.

As the results associated with the interest income and the benefits paid relating to customer balances are now material, we have
changed our presentation in the income statement to include within gross profit the revenue (as previously defined) and the results
from customer balances, which includes the interest income and interest expense on customer balances along with benefits paid
relating to customer balances. Benefits paid relating to customer balances was nil in the prior year and so are not included in the
change in presentation table. The net interest income from operating assets will remain unchanged in terms of presentation, refer to
note 2.13.

investing them into permitted financial assets. These amounts are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest
rate method.

Benefits paid relating to customer balances include incentives and other benefits provided to customers for holding their balances in
Wise accounts. These are recognised in the income statement in line with the balances held in Wise accounts and apportioned over
the same period of time.

2.3 Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current or non-current classification.

An asset is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

• expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;
• held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period;
• cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the
  reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

• it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;
• it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period;
• there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets
and liabilities.

2.4 Foreign currencies translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. For each entity, the Group determines the functional
currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the
date the transaction is recognised.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss (either as cost of sales or
administrative expenses). Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates if held at historical cost, or
year-end exchange rates if held at fair value, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in either the income
statement or shareholders’ equity depending on the treatment of the gain or loss on the asset or liability.

Group companies
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy) are translated into pounds sterling as follows:

• assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;
• income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

 Financial Statements         Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued




2.5 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, on-demand deposits, money market funds (MMFs) and other short-term high quality
liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less, and e-money held with payment processing partners. Cash that has
been paid out from the Group bank account but has not been delivered to the bank account of the beneficiary is classified as cash in
transit. Cash collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties are recognised under Trade and other receivables in the
statement of financial position.

Customer deposits
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities for the funds customers hold on their accounts (‘Wise accounts’) and the funds
collected from customers, as part of the money transfer settlement process, that have not yet been processed. The liability is
recognised upon receipt of cash or capture confirmation (depending on pay-in method), and is derecognised when cash is delivered
to the beneficiary. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have a legally enforceable right to set off these
financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle them on a net basis, or to settle them simultaneously.

Principles to determine the point of delivery are the same as applied in revenue recognition, see note 2.11.

The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to customer funds. As safeguarding
requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the Group holds customer funds in segregated
accounts and other high quality liquid assets such as MMFs and investment grade bonds, as allowed by local regulations.

2.6 Financial assets
Investments and other financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets, at initial recognition, and subsequently measures them at amortised cost, fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL), and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flows and the Group’s
business model for managing them.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are
‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test
and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at FVOCI,
irrespective of the business model.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how they are used in order to generate cash flows. The business
model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial
assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows, while financial assets
classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows
and selling.

The Group classifies debt securities (e.g. bonds) as FVOCI pursuant to the above policy as the contractual cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest, and the objective of the Group’s business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets. On disposal of these debt investments, any related balance within the FVOCI reserve is reclassified
to profit or loss.

Recognition and derecognition
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date according to market conventions. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Cash flows in relation to purchase or sale of these instruments are
classified as investing activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.

Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL,
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at
FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised costs are subsequently measured using the effective interest
method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified
or impaired.

Impairment
The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables and uses a simplified approach in
calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime
ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For debt instruments held at FVOCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Group evaluates
whether or not the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is
available without undue cost or effort.

In making that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group considers that
there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

The Group’s debt instruments held at FVOCI consist solely of quoted bonds that are graded in the top investment categories by
Moody’s credit rating agency and, therefore, are considered to be low credit risk investments. It is the Group’s policy to measure ECLs
on such instruments on a 12-month basis. However, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the
allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. The Group uses the ratings from Moody’s both to determine whether the debt instrument
has significantly increased in credit risk and to estimate ECLs.

Refer to notes 2.20 and 4.2 for further information on trade receivables and ECLs.

 Financial Statements         Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued




2.7 Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by the Group
are foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards and non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards. Such derivative financial
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting date.

All derivative instruments are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is
negative. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Group enters into
derivatives that are due to be realised or settled within 12 months; consequently they are presented as current assets or
current liabilities.

Fair value of a derivative financial instrument is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. When quoted
prices are not available, valuation techniques, that utilise observable inputs, are used to estimate fair value. The key inputs in the
valuation model are the relevant forward exchange rates for the currencies involved.

2.8 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term (1-7 years). Capitalised reconstruction and internal
design costs of leased office space (shown as ’Leased office improvements’ in the notes to the Group consolidated financial
statements) are depreciated over the lease term (typically 2-5 years), and other office equipment over 2 years.

Computer equipment is not recorded in property, plant and equipment but expensed as low-value short-lived equipment in the Group.

2.9 Intangible assets
Intangible assets predominantly relate to internally generated software, licences and domain purchases.

Internally generated software
The Group develops software used in provisioning of its services. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design,
development and testing of the software controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria
are met:

• it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use
• management intends to complete the software
• there is an ability to use the software
• it can be demonstrated that the software will generate probable future economic benefits
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software are available, and
• the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product comprise the software development employee costs.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs
previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Amortisation
Capitalised development costs, domain and licence purchases are recorded as intangible assets and amortised over their estimated
useful economic lives. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indicator that they might be impaired, for
example when the assets are no longer in use and need to be decommissioned.

The Group amortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for mobile applications which are amortised over 2
years and licence purchases that are amortised over a period of 2-10 years.

2.10 Trade and other payables
Trade payables consist of obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers on the basis of normal credit terms and do not bear interest. Other payables, which relate to Wise accounts and money
transfers that have not been processed by the Group at the reporting date, are non-derivative liabilities to individuals or business
customers for money they hold with the Group and do not constitute borrowings.

Payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

2.11 Revenue recognition
The Group primarily generates revenue from money transfers and Wise Account, including conversions and debit card services.

The Group recognises revenue according to the principles of IFRS 15 using the five-step model:

1. Identify the contracts with customers
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognise the revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation

A customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time of opening a Wise Account or initiating a money transfer. Generally, the
customer agrees to the contractual terms by formally accepting, on Wise’s website or the App, the terms and conditions of the
respective service, which detail the Group’s performance obligations and fees.

In the case of debit card services, a customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time the card is made available for use
and the customer is able to either make a payment or a withdrawal.

The transaction price is the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for providing services to a customer.
The fees charged to customers are shown to them upfront prior to the transaction being initiated. For international transfers, a single
upfront fee per transaction is charged, consisting of a fixed and a variable amount. The amount of both the fixed and the variable
portion of the fee depends on a number of factors, including the currency route, the transfer size, the type of transaction being
undertaken and the payment method used. Wise offers certain rebates in the form of a fee refund for eligible transactions. The refund
liability is recognised for the expected future rebates at the time of the transaction and deducted from revenue in accordance with
IFRS 15. .

The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations of the different revenue streams on the basis of relative standalone
selling prices. As there is typically a single performance obligation associated with each type of service provided to a customer, the
revenue is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied. For money transfers it is upon delivery
of funds to the recipient. In the case of money conversions it is when a customer balance is converted into a different currency and
for debit card services it is upon transaction capture.

The timing required for the Group to process the payment to the recipient and, hence, to satisfy its performance obligations largely
depends on the processing time its banking partners require to deliver funds to the recipient. Therefore, the revenue is deferred until
the funds are delivered. In certain jurisdictions where the Group has settlement accounts with the Central Banks or in the case of
transfers between Wise accounts or conversions within a Wise Account, such transactions are fulfilled instantly.

Other revenue
Wise Assets (‘Assets’), an investment product, allows customers to purchase units in funds provided by fund managers using their
Wise account balance. The Group generates revenue from charging a fee based on the value of the assets under management.
The revenue is accrued on a daily basis and is recognised over time, in line with the period the Group provides its services to
Assets customers.

The Group acts as a matched principal broker and does not retain control nor benefits from the Assets, thus it does not recognise the
financial assets and the respective liabilities for the Assets, and derecognises customer funds on purchase.

As at 31 March the title for the units of three of the funds was held, on the behalf of customers, by a non-dormant Wise entity.
Management performed an analysis to assess whether our accounting policy was therefore still appropriate and it was concluded that
the policy continued to apply for these funds.

2.12 Other operating income
Other operating income relates, predominantly, to other income recognition from contracts with partners and government grants for
qualifying research and development (R&D) activities.

Other income recognition from contracts with partners
Income from contracts with partners is recognised over their contractual terms as the relevant performance conditions are met.
The contracts may contain certain performance conditions and milestones. The Group defers any cash consideration received
up-front until it is probable that these conditions and milestones are met.

Government grants
Government grants recognised in other operating income relate to qualifying UK R&D under the research and development
expenditure credit (RDEC) scheme for large companies. Such grants are taxable and are presented as other operating income in the
consolidated income statement.

2.13 Interest income from operating assets
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method on corporate ‘cash and cash equivalents’.

2.14 Leases
A lease is a contract or part of a contract that conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identifiable asset for a period of
time in exchange for consideration.

The Group as lessee
Initial measurement

At the commencement date, a lessee shall recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. At the commencement date, a lessee
shall measure the right-of-use asset at cost. The cost of the right-of-use asset shall comprise:

• the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
• any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;
• any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and
• an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is
  located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

Right-of-use of assets are recorded within the ‘Property, plant and equipment’ line in the statement of financial position and
are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability; they are predominantly related to office spaces leased in various locations.
The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined.

If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the
individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a
similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

At the commencement date, the lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following payments
for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date:

• fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;
• variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date.
  Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate include, for example, payments linked to a consumer price index;
• amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
• the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
• payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.

Subsequent measurement
After the commencement date, a lessee measures the right-of-use asset estimated by applying a cost model. To apply a cost model,
a lessee measures the right-of-use asset at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and
adjust for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life and the lease term, on a straight-
line basis.

Otherwise, the lessee shall depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life
of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

If there are changes in lease payments, there may be a need to remeasure the lease liability. A lessee shall recognise the amount of
the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, a lessee shall recognise any
remaining amount of the remeasurement in profit or loss.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of
low value. Payments associated with short-term leases and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an
expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT and office
equipment. The total expense, relating to short-term leases to which the lessee recognition and measurement requirement have not
been applied, for the year ended 31 March 2023 is £1.4m (2022: £nil).

The Group presents the payments of principal and interest on lease liabilities as part of financing cash flows.

Extension and termination options
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to
maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. The extension and termination options
held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors.

At the reporting date, the Group is exposed to future cash outflows that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities.
These arise from extension options and a termination option available to the Group for a number of lease agreements for office
spaces. The Group initially assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain it will exercise the options and
subsequently reassesses if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control. The Group has
concluded it is not reasonably certain that the options will be exercised.

2.15 Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises the costs that are directly associated with the Group’s principal revenue stream of money transfer, conversion
services and debit card services. This includes:

• banking and customer related fees, including any applicable discounts, incurred in processing customer transfers, as well as the
  card production costs;
• net foreign exchange costs generated due to customer transactions and costs related to the difference between the published
  mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate obtained by the Group in acquiring currency as required. Net foreign exchange
  differences from the revaluation of customer balances at period end are also included. Other product costs include product losses
  that are directly generated from consumer transactions, including chargeback losses, as well as taxes directly attributable to
  customer activity.

2.16 Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts
in the Group financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised, or the deferred tax
liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets on share-based payments are recognised for the share options not exercised at the balance sheet date. The
deferred tax assets on share-based payments are determined based on the share price at the balance sheet date. The impact of
recognition is split between income tax expense in profit or loss for the year, for the element up to the cumulative remuneration
expense; and the share-based payment reserve, recognised directly in equity, for the element in excess of the related cumulative
remuneration expense. Refer to note 11 for further details.

The impact of the recognition of deferred tax assets on losses is split between the share-based payment reserve, for the element of
the tax deduction on exercise in excess of the related cumulative remuneration expense, and the income tax expense in profit or loss
for the balance of the loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the
same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.17 Employee benefits
Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and accumulating annual leave, that are expected to be settled
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of
employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities
are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.

Long-term obligations
Employee entitlement for long-term leave is recognised as a liability using probability of staff departures and leave utilisation.

Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of employee equity-settled schemes as part of its reward strategy. The fair value of the employee
services received in exchange for the grant of the options and awards is recognised in employee benefit expenses together with a
corresponding increase in equity (share-based payment reserves), over the period in which the service and the performance
conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period).

The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and it is recognised over the
vesting period. For non-market-based awards, vesting conditions are included in the assumptions of the number of options and
awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options and awards that
are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income,
with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve. For awards subject to a market-based performance condition,
no subsequent adjustments may be made. Upon exercise of share options, the impact is recognised in retained earnings.

2.18 Employee share trust
The Group provides finance to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either purchase Company’s shares on the open
market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital, to meet the Group’s obligation to provide shares when employees exercise
their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the consolidated income statement. Shares held by the ESOP
Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares until such time that employees exercise their awards.

Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity.

2.19 Segment reporting
The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment. This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to, and regularly
reviewed by, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’), which is currently the Board of Directors of the Group. The Group has
therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is the ‘cross border payment services’. Refer to
note 5.

2.20 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from payment processors and collateral deposits the Group holds with
its counterparts. Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less
impairment for expected credit losses. The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected
lifetime credit losses to be recognised from the initial recognition of the receivables. Refer to note 2.6 above for further information on
expected credit losses.

2.21 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, after deducting shares held by the ESOP Trust.

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:

• the after-income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares; and
• the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding, assuming the conversion of all
  dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the purposes of diluted earnings per share it is assumed that any performance conditions
  attached to the schemes have been met at the balance sheet date.

2.22 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest expense, within
the finance expense, in the income statement over the term of the borrowing, using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the
establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the
facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred and treated as a transaction cost when the draw-down occurs. The Group
presents the impact of transaction costs as part of financing cash flows.

2.23 Provisions
Provisions are liabilities where the exact timing and amount of the obligation are uncertain. Provisions are recognised when the Group
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, when an outflow of resources is probable to settle the
obligation and when an amount can be reliably estimated. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to
current values using appropriate rates of interest. The unwinding of the discounts is recorded in net finance income or expense.

2.24 Specific allowance for expected credit losses
The Group may recognise specific allowance for individually material financial assets for which credit quality deteriorates significantly.
The Group takes into account specific facts and circumstances that might indicate impairment, such as litigation risk, credit rating and
financial results of the counterparty. The Group also uses the weighted probability method to assess the recoverability of the amounts
and monitors subsequent changes in the assumptions and estimates on a regular basis.

2.25 Legal provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group may become party to litigation proceedings from time to time and recognises a legal provision when a) it has a present
obligation as the result of a past event, b) it is probable the outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and
c) a reliable estimate of such amount can be made. If these conditions are not met, the Group discloses contingent liabilities; unless
the likelihood of the outflow of the economic benefit is remote.

Note 3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about these estimates and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:

3.1 Customer balances
The Group recognises financial assets and corresponding liabilities for the funds customers hold on their Wise accounts and the funds
the Group receives as part of the money transfer settlement process. At the point that the cash is received from the customer, the
Group becomes party to a contract and has a right and an ability to control the economic benefit from the cash flows associated with
this balance. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group considers it does not have a legally enforceable right to set off these financial
assets and liabilities, or an intention to settle them on a net basis or settle them simultaneously. Therefore, Management has
concluded that the recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the balance sheet is appropriate.

3.2 Net gains and losses from foreign exchange differences
The Group classifies net foreign exchange gains and losses from customer transactions, including the costs related to the difference
between the published mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate obtained by the Group in acquiring currency as required,
as cost of sales. The Group considers these costs as directly related to and incurred as part of providing services to customers.
The total net foreign exchange differences recognised in cost of sales for the year ended 31 March 2023 is £24.5m (2022: £13.3m).

Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial
statements were prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances
arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of estimation.

Note 4. Financial risk and capital management
This note further explains the Group’s exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect the Group’s future financial
performance. Current year profit and loss information has been included where relevant to add context.

In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to the main financial risks: liquidity, credit, and market risk from its use of financial
instruments. The Group’s financial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s
financial performance.

4.1 Liquidity risk
The Group actively monitors its liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s
liquidity requirements to make sure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance
between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of external working capital funding and corporate funds.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, that it always has enough liquid resources to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s
position. The Group utilises an internal liquidity adequacy assessment process, incorporating micro- and macro-economic stress
testing to ensure the Group maintains prudent levels of liquid resources at all times to meet both regulatory requirements and the
internal liquidity risk appetite.

The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded to be low. The Group has access to a
£300.0m multi-currency revolving facility.

The breakdowns of trade payables and borrowings into current and non-current are shown in notes 18 and 19. See also note 4.5 for
the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

4.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations.

Credit risk is managed at Group level and comes mainly from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents held in banks and investments in
bonds. The impairment provisions for financial assets disclosed in note 15 are based on assumptions about risk of default and
expected loss rates.

If a bank or other financial institution has no independent credit rating, the Group evaluates its credit quality by analysing its financial
position, past experience, and other factors.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk by class of financial asset is as follows:

                                                                                                                              2023       2022

Due to the short duration of the cash and cash equivalents (less than 3 months), the fair value approximates the carrying value at
each reporting period.

Credit risk is mitigated as financial assets subject to credit risk are held with reputable institutions or in highly rated
financial investments.

4.3 Market risk
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from floating interest rate borrowings, refer to note 19, and manages the potential that
financial expenses increase when interest rates increase. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the interest rate risk.

In a stressed scenario a change of 10 basis points in the interest rates of interest-bearing liabilities at the reporting date would have
changed profit and equity by £0.1m (2022: £0.1m).

Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate movement from holding assets and liabilities in different currencies and guaranteeing
customers a foreign exchange rate on their international transfers for a limited period of time. Wise actively monitors foreign exchange
risk, and exposures are managed through a combination of natural hedging and treasury products hedging.

At the reporting date, there are open treasury positions of notional contract amounts of £366.2m (2022: £139.7m), with remaining
maturity between 3 to 11 days. The total fair value of those derivative contracts, at the reporting date, is not materially different from
their total fair value at the date those derivative contracts were entered into. Consequently, no derivative financial instrument is
presented in the financial assets or liabilities as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: no derivative financial instrument is presented in
the financial assets or liabilities). The notional contract amounts of those derivatives held to manage the foreign exchange exposure
indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date. They do not represent amounts at risk. Post balance
sheet date all open treasury positions have been realised or settled.

The table below presents the Group’s net position (difference between financial assets and liabilities) across its main currencies and
the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk at the end of each reporting period.

A 5% strengthening or weakening of GBP against all other currencies, with all other variables being constant, would result in a foreign
exchange loss or gain of £1.7m (2022: £0.8m), excluding the tax effect.

The Group considers a 5% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its
subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

4.4 Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to
meet its regulatory capital requirements, both under normal operating environments and stressed conditions.

The Group’s capital comprises ordinary share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital risk are to:

• safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that the Group can continue to provide returns for shareholders
  and benefits for other stakeholders;
• maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital;
• adhere to regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction; and
• fund an orderly wind-down in an adverse reverse scenario.

 Financial Statements         Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued




Further information on the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital along with the disclosure requirements under
MIFIDPRU 8, can be found on our Owner relations website: https://wise.com/owners/.

The Group is subject to prudential regulatory consolidation which follows the rules in the sourcebook for MIFID investment firms
(‘MIFIDPRU’). This is due to the existence of TINV Ltd, a group UK FCA-regulated investment firm subject to these rules.

Both TINV Ltd (a MIFID investment firm) and the Group (a MIFID investment group) are classified as Non-small and
Non-interconnected investment firms (‘non-SNI’).

Overall own funds requirement
The Group own funds requirement is subject to the variable own funds requirement that is the highest of:

1. its permanent minimum capital requirement (i.e. its initial capital requirement);
2. its fixed overheads requirement (‘FOR’); and
3. its K-factor requirement (‘KFR’).

The Group also follows and adheres to the Overall Own Funds Threshold Requirement as this is derived by the Group’s Internal Capital
Adequacy Assessment (‘ICARA’) and approved by the Board. ICARA is a continuous risk assessment process which considers the
business model implication on capital and liquidity on an ongoing basis pursuant to the guidance of MIFIDPRU 7.

4.5 Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets mainly consist of cash, short-term trade and other receivables and listed bonds. Its financial liabilities
include trade liabilities and obligations towards financial institutions. All purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the
settlement date according to market conventions.

The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

• the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and
• the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) comprise investments into highly liquid bonds with the
objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group estimates that the fair values of assets and liabilities reported at amortised cost in the statement of financial position
as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 do not materially differ from the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements.

The carrying amount of current accounts receivable and payable less impairments is estimated to be approximately equal to their
fair value.

IFRS 13 has sought to make measurements at fair value more consistent and comparable by categorising fair value according to the
hierarchy of the inputs used to measure them. These are categorised from Level 1 to Level 3 as follows:

• Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities which the Group can access at the date of measurement.
• Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly.
• Level 3 - Inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value by the
level in the fair value hierarchy as at the reporting date:
                                                                                                                       2023             2022

Financial instruments in level 1
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market
is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current close price at the balance sheet date.

If the fair value of the short-term financial assets would change by 1% at the reporting date, that would result in a £38.0m
(2022: £11.9m) increase or decrease in the balances and the corresponding impact on the comprehensive income.

Financial instruments in level 2 and 3
Throughout and at the end of the reporting year, the Group had no financial instruments in level 2 and 3, consistent with the
prior year.

Note 5. Segment information
Description of segment
The information regularly reported to the Board of Directors, who are considered to be the CODM, for the purposes of resource
allocation and the assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s business
model, the Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is ‘Cross-border payment services’.

The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the statement of
comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of revenue by type of customer and geographical region,
is set out in note 6.

At the end of each reporting period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise Payments Ltd in the UK. Based on
the location of the non-current assets, the following geographical breakdown of non-current assets is prepared:

The Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) before other comprehensive income (OCI) is a 22% charge (2022: 25% charge).

This equates to the applicable UK corporation tax rate of 19%, adjusted for a number of factors such as the change in the rate of
recognition of deferred tax as a result of the UK corporation tax rate change, non-deductible employee option plan costs, movement
in tax provisions and higher overseas tax rates.

On 10 June 2021, an increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% applicable from 1 April 2023 was enacted. Therefore, the
UK deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are expected to unwind after 1 April 2023, have been measured in the current reporting
period based on the increased UK corporation tax rate (25%) and reflected accordingly in the statement of profit and loss and equity.

The deferred tax asset is predominantly generated in the UK and the US and mainly comprises unexercised share options and losses
generated by share-based payment deductions. The deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine
recoverability and to determine a reasonable time frame for utilisation. To determine this, the Group uses the approved Group forecast
used for the Viability Statement and going concern analysis. There is no time limit for utilisation of UK or US tax losses. In addition, the
UK and the US have sufficient taxable profits in FY2023 to commence utilisation of brought forward losses. In light of this analysis, the
Group considers it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the next 6 years to realise the deferred tax asset.
Consequently, the Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of £nil (2022: £nil) and the asset has been recognised
in full as at 31 March 2022 and 2023.

Software is internally generated intangible asset which consists of capitalised development costs. Other intangible assets primarily
include licences and domain purchases.

In addition to capitalised amounts as software intangible, the Group expensed £91.8m of product engineering costs for the year
ended 31 March 2023 (2022: £59.8m). These costs directly relate to the development of the Group's product offerings and primarily
comprise employee costs of the engineering and product teams, that do not meet the capitalisation criteria.

* Net of expected credit loss provision of £31.5m as at 31 March 2023 (2022: £19.8m). The movement in the year is predominantly related to increased
  activity and the corresponding increase in customer balances; this resulted in the increase of overdrawn customer’s balances older than 30 days.
  Customer chargebacks increased by £1.2m to £4.1m at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: £2.9m) and overdrawn accounts increased by £17.9m to
  £27.4m (31 March 2022: £9.5m). During the year, the recognised specific provision for the receivables with MS Bank S.A. Banco de Câmbio was utilised
  (2022: specific provision of £7.4m).

The carrying values of current trade receivables approximate their fair values because these balances are expected to be cash-
settled in the near future unless a provision is made.

The interest expense accrued is recognised within finance expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Revolving credit facility (RCF)
The Group has access to a multi-currency debt facility of £300.0m with a maturity date in 2025 and 2 1-year, extension options.
The RCF is a multi-bank facility with Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited (‘SVB UK’), Citibank N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.,
National Westminster Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding.

The facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to SONIA plus a margin determined by reference to adjusted leverage (calculated
as a ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA). The agreement contains certain customary covenants, including to maintain a maximum total
net leverage ratio not in excess of 3:1 and interest cover (calculated as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to finance charges in accordance
with the terms of the agreement) not less than a ratio of 4:1 in respect of any relevant period.

The Group monitors compliance with the covenants throughout the reporting period. On 31 March 2023, the Group was in breach of a
representation in the RCF Agreement, which meant that further draw-downs and roll-overs of credit were temporarily suspended.
This technical breach was waived by lenders before the date of signing these financial statements and the facility was fully resumed.
As a result of this technical breach on 31 March and the future intention of the Group to use the facility primarily for short-term
funding, the facility has been recorded as a current liability on the balance sheet. The Group has complied with all financial covenants
for this and all reporting periods. The undrawn amount of the facility as at 31 March 2023 was £50.0m (2022: £132.0m).

The facility is secured by certain customary security interests and pledges including over shares in certain Group entities (Wise plc,
Wise Financial Holdings Ltd, Wise Payments Limited, Wise US Inc., Wise Europe SA and Wise Australia Pty Ltd), and fixed and floating
pledges over assets and undertakings of Wise Payments Ltd, excluding customer and partner funds, share capital or equity
contributions maintained for regulatory purposes, cash paid into a bank or collateral account in connection with, and for the benefit of,
relevant card scheme providers and assets held in safeguarded accounts or otherwise segregated for regulatory purposes.

Lease liabilities
As at 31 March 2023, the lease liabilities are £14.5m (2022 £17.2m) and relate to the expected terms remaining on UK, US, Estonia,
Hungary, Singapore, Belgium and Brazil office space leases discounted at between 2.21% and 15.75%. The leases expire
between 2023-2029.

The Group has an extension option in an office lease, which has not been exercised as at 31 March 2023. The potential future lease
payments, should the Group exercise the extension options, would result in an increase in the lease liability of £1.0m.

The Group has a termination option in an office lease, which has not been exercised as at 31 March 2023. The potential future
lease payments, should the Group exercise the termination option, would result in a decrease in the lease liability of £1.4m.

During the year, the Group allotted 87,396 class A Ordinary Shares of £0.01 related to customer shareholder programme (2022:
82,736,034 class A Ordinary Shares of £0.01 related to employee share options awards).

Each Class A Ordinary shareholder is entitled to one vote for each Class A Ordinary Share held, subject to any restrictions on total
voting rights as set out in the Company's Articles of Association. Class A Ordinary shareholders are entitled to interim or annual
dividends to the extent declared and do not hold any preferential rights to dividends. Class A Ordinary Shares are non-redeemable.

Each Class B shareholder is entitled to nine votes for each Class B Share held, subject to any restrictions on total voting rights as set
out in the Company's Articles of Association. Class B Shares carry no rights to distributions of dividends except on distribution of
assets, up to their nominal value, on a liquidation or winding up. Class B Shares are strictly non-transferable, non-tradable and non-
distributable to any person or entity whatsoever.

Note 21. Equity merger reserve and other reserves
Equity merger reserve
As disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, the Class A Shares of the Company were admitted to trading on the London
Stock Exchange on 7 July 2021. The merger reserve arises from the Group pre-listing reorganisation accounted for as a capital
reorganisation. Upon the reorganisation, the Group's Ordinary Shares have been represented as those of Wise plc. The difference
between Wise Payments Ltd net assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the merger reserve.

Other reserves
Other reserves predominantly relate to investments into highly liquid bonds measured at FVOCI. For these investments, changes in
fair value are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. On disposal of these debt investments, any related balance within
the FVOCI reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. Comparative figures include £4.8m net loss on disposal of a number of listed bonds,
that was transferred from other reserves in equity to other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. No debt
investments were disposed during the year.

Note 22. Own share reserve
In January 2023, Wise announced the intention of the Employee Benefit Trust to acquire up to £10.0m of Wise shares in the market in
order to reduce the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. As of 31 March 2023, a total of 1,776,098 shares were
purchased from the market at an average of £5.63 per share. Directly attributable costs of £0.1m have been expensed to equity.

Note 23. Share-based employee compensation
The employee share schemes are designed to provide long-term incentives for all employees to deliver long-term shareholder
returns. Under the plans, participants are granted share awards in the Company, which vest gradually over a 4-year period and are
equity settled for shares within Wise plc. The awards are subject to service conditions, i.e. the requirement for recipients of awards to
remain in employment with the Group over the vesting period. During the year, an award was granted that its vesting is conditional on
achievement of the relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the FTSE 250 and volume growth performance measures over
the 3-year performance period.

Transactions on the share schemes for employees during the year were as follows:

                                                                                 As at 31 March 2023                 As at 31 March 2022

Valuation of share awards
The assessed fair value at the grant date of share awards granted during the year ended 31 March 2023 was £5.12 per option on
average (2022: £9.51). The fair value of the share awards granted is calculated using the closing share price at the grant date.

The fair value of the share options granted prior to the listing was independently determined using the Black-Scholes model that takes
into account the exercise price, the term of the share option, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the
underlying share, the risk-free interest rate for the term of the share option and the correlations and volatilities of the peer
group companies.

The Black-Scholes model inputs included:

• Options are granted for no consideration and vest over the 4-year period according to the vesting conditions
• Average exercise price: £0.01
• No dividends are expected to be paid
• Expected price volatility of the Company’s shares: 48%
• Risk-free interest rate: 1.44%
• Expected price volatility is based on the comparative information of the peer-group companies


Risk-free interest rate is based on the UK 5-year government bond yield.

Share trust
The Group consolidates one share trust. The Group’s own share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares in the
Wise Group Employee Benefit Trust (Ocorian) which are held for the purposes of fulfilling obligations in respect of the Group’s
share awards.

Notes to the Company
financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2023



Note 1. Accounting policies for the Company financial statements
General information
The Company is a public limited company, limited by shares, and is incorporated in England. The Company primarily operates as a
holding company for the Group’s subsidiaries.

Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS 102’) and the
Companies Act 2006. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s income statement and related notes
have not been presented in these financial statements. The profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 was £1.1m ( period from
18 February 2021 to 31 March 2022: loss of £0.2m).

In preparing these financial statements, the Company has taken advantage of certain exemptions permitted by FRS 102, as the
equivalent disclosures are made in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Exemptions have been applied in respect of the following disclosures:

• The cash flow statement and related notes
• Share-based payments
• Capital management disclosures
• Certain related-party transactions including the remuneration of key management personnel
• Financial instrument disclosures
• A reconciliation of shares outstanding at the beginning and end of the period

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments that are measured at
fair value at the end of the reporting period; and on a going concern basis.

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies.

Dividends
The Group has not declared or paid out any dividends for the year ended 31 March 2023 (no dividend paid for the year ended
31 March 2022).

The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company are set out below.

Significant accounting policies
The following principal accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value.

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
an investment may not be recoverable.

If any indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.

Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the reporting period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised
directly in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss
for the reporting period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement
of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the
temporary difference can be utilised.

Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan for the employees of subsidiary undertakings using the
Company’s equity instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of this share-based compensation plan is
recognised as a capital contribution to the Company’s subsidiary undertakings over the vesting period. The capital contribution is
reduced by any payments received from subsidiary undertakings in respect of these share-based payments.

Employee share trust
The Group provides finance to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either purchase Company’s shares on the open
market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital, to meet the Group’s obligation to provide shares when employees exercise
their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the consolidated income statement. Shares held by the ESOP
Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares until such time that employees exercise their awards.

Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity instruments, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires that management make certain estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and
assumptions, which are based on management’s best estimates at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances,
the original estimate and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.

Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of judgement and estimation.

Note 2. Dividend income
The Company did not receive dividend income from subsidiary undertakings during the year (period from 18 February 2021 to
31 March 2022: £0.8m).

Alternative performance
measures
The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting. These measures are not
defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable with the APMs of other companies.

The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing alternative interpretations of
the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed and they are used by the Directors and management for
performance analysis and reporting. These APMs should be viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute for, measures presented
in the financial statements which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

 Income                          Income is defined as revenue plus interest income on customer balances,         See definition for

                                 measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by
                                 management to evaluate the Group’s performance and make financial,
                                 strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to
                                 understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the
                                 underlying trends in the Group’s performance on a comparable basis,
