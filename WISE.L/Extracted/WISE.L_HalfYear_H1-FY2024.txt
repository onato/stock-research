        GREAT PROGRESS IN BUILDING THE NETWORK FOR THE WORLD’S MONEY;
           CUSTOMER GROWTH CONTINUES TO COMPOUND AT OVER 30%

“In the first six months of this year we continued to make progress against our mission of
building the best way to move and manage the world’s money. We continued to invest in
making our account features available to more people and businesses, and we made great
progress in building the network for the world’s money - having completed our integration into
NPP and announcing our collaboration with Swift. This has driven our growth and the
fundamentals of our financial performance. Our customer base grew by over 30% supporting
25% growth in revenue, a 58% increase in Income and a 163% increase in adjusted EBITDA for
the period.

               We continue to invest in the operational capabilities that allow us to build great
                products, efficiently onboard, service and protect our customers, and fight financial
                crime

        We have an increasingly profitable and highly cash generative business model, which is
        underpinning the investment in our growth
            Revenue increased 25% to £498 million, as strong customer growth and adoption of the
              account led to higher volumes, and fees from account features. Income 1 increased 58%
              to £656 million driven by revenues, and the interest income on customers’ balances.
            Gross profit increased by 86% to £489 million, and our gross profit margin was 75%;
              supported by higher interest income and lower FX costs in the period
            Adjusted EBITDA of £241 million, equivalent to a 37% margin 2 , remains elevated whilst
              we work to share more of the benefits of higher interest rates with customers

        Outlook
            As outlined in our Q2 FY24 trading update, we expect Income growth for FY24 to be
               between 33-38% (previously 28-33%) given the strong start to the year and our higher
               interest income expectations
            We continue to expect Income growth of >20% (CAGR) over the medium term
            We also continue to target an adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20% over the
               medium term, and so long as interest rates remain >1%, our adjusted EBITDA margin
               will remain structurally higher than our targeted (at or above 20%) level
            However our adjusted EBITDA margin will be considerably higher than this in FY24
               given the higher interest rates and the reality that we are unable to return interest to
               customers at the level we would like

An update from Harsh Sinha, Chief Technology Officer and Interim CEO
Our mission is to build the best way to move and manage the world’s money.

In the first six months of FY24 we made great progress against our mission. By continuing to
improve the Wise account and make more of the features available to more people and
businesses around the world, we were able to help over 30% more customers solve their
international needs. We also continued to broaden and deepen our global payment network
which we expect to enable us to complete more instant payments and drive lower pricing over
time. And we did all of this whilst delivering strong profitability and cash flow.

Our customer base is growing c.30% YoY into a huge market where we have a small share
A massive problem continues to exist for people and businesses around the world; moving and
managing money internationally is still broken. It remains expensive, slow, inconvenient and
opaque. The opportunity that comes with solving this problem is huge, and whilst we are
among the largest independent cross-border providers, we still have just a c.5% share of the
personal market and less than 1% share of the SMB market.

But we are growing fast and helping more customers every year. In fact, more than 30% more
people and businesses used Wise compared with the same period last year. In Q2 FY24 alone,
we helped 7.2 million customers solve their international needs. This rate of active customer
growth is consistent with the rate at which we’ve grown over the last 3 years.

As a result, when compared to the same period last year, we’ve helped people and businesses
to move 12% more cross-border payments, spend 90% more using a Wise card, and hold 33%
more in balances in multi-currency accounts. And this is driving the fundamentals of our
financial performance.

Our customer growth continues to be word-of-mouth led; the result of a market-leading and
increasingly global proposition
With the Wise Account; Wise Business; and Wise Platform, we serve millions of people, small
businesses, financial institutions and enterprises all over the world.

In the first half of the year we rolled out more of our Account features to more customers. We
introduced the “Interest” Assets feature in more European countries; Germany, Sweden,
Norway and Estonia and extended the “Stocks” Assets feature to an additional 11 countries in
Europe, giving more people optionality on how they earn a return on the money they hold with
us. We also launched a service for expats in China to send their salaries back home.

Ongoing investment into product development adds to use cases and enhances user
experience. In Australia we removed the balance charge fee, in Canada account holders can
now receive into Wise via Interac, and now in Malaysia we have both Apple Pay and Google
Pay available.

With continued investment in features to make our customers’ lives easier, combined with low
cost, fast payments, the quality of our Account speaks for itself. We consistently see around
two-thirds of new customers join us through word-of-mouth from existing customers. This
virality, which we’ve seen for several years, allows us to acquire customers at a low cost.




                                                                                                 5
As we’ve built and launched more features to help people and businesses move and manage
their money, adoption of the account has continued to increase. In Q2 FY24, 44% of active
personal customers used multiple features of the Wise Account, up from 32% in Q2 FY23. For
businesses, this adoption rate was 58%, up from 53% in Q2 FY23. Given the higher active
customer base, the greater adoption means that we had 80% more multi feature personal
customers and around 40% more multi feature business customers, compared with Q2 FY23.

More customers using the account features has led to an increase in the balances held with
Wise too. As at 30 September 2023, customers held £12.3bn in cash balances, 33% higher
than this time last year and, separately, over £1.7bn of funds in the ‘Assets’ feature3. This
growth in cash balances is in line with growth in active customers.

In addition to the features and benefits that we offer to our customers, high quality support
drives higher customer engagement. Whilst we’ve added more product features, we’ve also
managed to improve our support contact rates (the percentage of customers that need to
contact us for help). In fact, in the first half of the year we saw a 16% reduction in our contact
rates compared to H1 FY23 by improving our payout processing and making it easier and more
intuitive for customers to use the account for receiving money. Not only does this ensure we
delight more customers, but is also hugely valuable in terms of operational efficiency.

Wise Platform continues to make good progress and we now work with over 70 Platform
partners. So far in FY24, we have welcomed 9 new Platform partners and they represent how
Platform has evolved to now offer a range of features that are common to our account
customers. For example, we went live with two new partners, Prospend and Parpera, our first
partnerships that will provide multi-currency accounts and digital debit cards. Amongst our
new partners, we also signed a partnership with Saudi Awwal Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC, and
we went live with IndusInd Bank in India, Bluevine investment platform in the US, moomoo
investment platform in Singapore, and GMO Azora Net Bank in Japan.

We continue to invest in building a the network for the world’s money
We’re building the replacement infrastructure for the world’s money that is international by
default, enabling a global proposition that allows customers to easily manage their money and
make instant international payments at a low cost.

In Q2 FY24 the average fee our customers paid on a cross-border transaction was 0.67%,
marginally higher than the fee of 0.63% in Q2 FY23, but we remain committed to reducing
these over time as we invest in our infrastructure. And 60% of all payments were completed
instantly, 81% completed within an hour and 94% within 24 hours.

The question is: how do we do this? Our infrastructure is underpinned by us building the
network for the world’s money - made up of a network of licences and connections into
payments systems; and in the operational capabilities that support this, comprising our
technology and operations. As set out below, in the first half of the year we’ve made some
great developments across these, and we’ve also overcome some challenges.

In H1 FY24 we call out two key successes in improving our network of connections and
licences. First, we completed our integration into the New Payments Platform (NPP),



                                                                                                 6
Australia’s domestic payment system which gives us full end-to-end control of the payment
network into Australia. These are complex integrations, and it’s taken us close to three years
from initial conversations, but once fully rolled out to all of our customers, it will enable us to
provide instant payments consistently and to reduce bank and partner fees significantly.

One of the many benefits of being directly integrated into local payments systems is that it
reduces our reliance on third parties to access payment systems. But direct access isn’t
currently available to us everywhere, and where we don’t have direct access we have built an
extensive network of partners to support us. Having this network is critical, and this proved
valuable in recent months as one of our banking partnerships in the US came to an end. We
have been able to quickly commence the migration of customers to another of our partners,
and whilst this will cause some inconvenience for our customers, the redundancy we had built
into our network proved invaluable.

Our second success was the announcement of a collaboration with Swift. We call this
Correspondent Services, which will provide a new solution for banks and other financial
institutions to simply route their Swift messages to Wise and send payments through our
network without the need to fully integrate into our API. Although it’s early days, this is a
fantastic opportunity to collaborate more easily with traditional banks and to solve the cross-
border needs of many more people and businesses.

Elsewhere, our teams have been extending our network of partners across APAC to improve
payment speeds, and have been working with existing partners in the US to enable faster
payments. As an example, we’ve been working with JPMorgan to enable all payouts into Chase
accounts to be completed within a minute, and elsewhere in the US we’ve been working with a
partner to enable instant payouts for customers whose bank is connected to the Real Time
Payment (RTP) network.

We continue to work with existing and new regulators around the world to extend and deepen
our licence footprint, and in the past months we have been able to leverage our investment
licence in Europe to allow the team to roll out the Interest Assets product to several more
European countries.

Our network of connections and licences enables us to move money around the world, but to
build great products and provide excellent service we continue to invest in our technology and
operational capabilities.

Our technology reflects the ongoing investment of c.800 engineers, and features a single
global treasury system and a machine learning powered anti-financial crime engine - both
updating in real-time. These are critical to enabling us to grow at scale whilst making instant
payments in a controlled way.

We uplift our systems constantly, evolving as the business grows in size and complexity. This
is a critical ability when operating in an environment that can move quickly, leading to
heightened risk, such as from fast changing sanctions lists to evolving behaviours from
fraudsters.




                                                                                                      7
As an example, as was reported in August 2023, we identified and self-reported a £250 ATM
withdrawal in June 2022 that had been made by an employee of a business owned by a
sanctions-designated individual. Our system caught the transaction early, and we took
immediate steps to implement changes needed to avoid this type of transaction moving
forward. Though we never want such instances to occur, when they do, we learn from them
and come out stronger. Like all financial services companies, there is a risk that our services
may be misused for financial crime. This is especially true against a backdrop of heightened
geopolitical conflicts. To mitigate this risk, we are continuing to invest in maintaining robust
anti-financial crime systems and controls, which allow us to spot, prevent and respond to risks
quickly whenever needed. We also work closely with our regulators and banking partners to
stop potential abuse of our services.

We shared with you last year how we had been making a significant investment in our
operational teams. This led to a large increase in headcount and expenses last year, and
continuing this investment will help us uplift our servicing capacity.

Whilst we have more to build as we scale across the world, we believe the global payment
network that we’ve already created is becoming increasingly more difficult to replicate. And it
enables us to continue to offer significantly lower prices than the alternative for many people
and businesses, and payments that are now majority instant.

We’re confident in the outlook for the second half of the year and beyond
We’ve made great progress against our mission in the first half of this year, and our
investments continue to create the capabilities and products that are the foundation for our
customer-led growth. And it’s this customer-led growth that is driving the fundamentals of our
financial performance. Active customers have continued to compound at around 30%, and this
has helped drive a 58% increase in Income and even faster growth in our adjusted EBITDA,
which increased to £241 million (equivalent to a margin of 37%).

This gives us confidence as we look ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, and
we’re very pleased to be able to signal this with our recently upgraded Income guidance.

Our focus remains on building products that customers love and building the network for the
world’s money. In doing so we’ll continue to build out this generational company which over the
long term will create massive value for customers and shareholders alike.

A financial update from Matt, our CFO
The impact of compounding customer growth and wide adoption of the Wise account has led
to another period of strong financial performance; driving both the top line and bottom line -
supporting a 2.6x increase in adjusted EBITDA in the period.

Income growth driven by strong customer growth and greater adoption of more Wise
Account features
In the first six months, over 30% more customers used Wise to send or convert money
internationally. Of the 7.2 million active customers in Q2 FY24, 6.8 million were personal
customers (+32% YoY) and 0.4 million were business customers (+28% YoY).

And more of those customers used multiple features of the account. In Q2 FY24, 44% of active
personal customers (Q2 FY23: 32%) and 58% of active business customers (Q2 FY23: 53%)
used their Wise accounts to not just convert and send money, but also to spend internationally
with their cards, or to hold a balance with us. This means we had 80% more people using
multiple features of the Wise Account and around 40% more businesses using multiple features
of the Wise Business product compared to the second quarter of FY23. This has become
increasingly supportive of income growth and profitability.

Our customers sent or converted £57.4 billion of volume in H1 FY24. This is a 12% increase on
last year (14% increase on a constant currency basis), with growth in volumes continuing to be
driven by higher numbers of active customers. Volume growth amongst customers that
typically move less than £10k per month has been resilient. However, macroeconomic
conditions remain uncertain, and in the first half of the year, this was one factor that has had
an impact on the level of volume growth amongst our high transaction value customers, which
resulted in a declining volume per customer, which we expect to continue throughout FY24 and
beyond. Our growth rate also reflects a notably tough comparative period in H1 FY23, which
benefited substantially from high activity related to the strength of the USD.

Revenue from cross border transactions grew 20% to £384 million for the period, and the take
rate on cross border revenue by 5 bps to 0.67%, largely reflecting recent price increases as we
made a strong investment in building more operational capacity to support our growth. Other
revenue (predominantly interchange income) increased by 48% to £113.8 million. This growth
was driven by higher take up and spending on the Wise card, but partly offset by an action we
took last year to remove fees for same currency transactions. This led to a 5 bps increase in
the other take rate to 0.20%. Revenue for the period increased by 25% to £498.2 million. This
represents a revenue take rate of 0.87% (H1 FY23: 0.77%).

The higher active customer numbers and greater account adoption also led to a 33% increase
in customer balances (excluding funds held in ‘Assets’ product) to £12.3 billion. Through the
increase in customer balances, and the higher interest rate environment compared with H1
FY23, interest income net of the benefits paid to customers increased to £157.8 million (H1
FY23: £18.7 million), further supporting Income, which increased 58% to £656.0 million.

Gross profit is growing fast and creates significant capacity to invest for growth
Our gross profit for the period increased by 86% to £488.9 million, which led to an 11.5
percentage point increase in the gross profit margin, to 75%. Our variable costs (cost of sales
and net credit losses on financial assets), increased by 9%, driven by the 12% increase in
cross-border volumes, partly offset by the benefit of lower FX costs compared to H1 FY23. The
majority of the gross margin increase was driven by the higher interest rate earned on the
growing balances that our customers hold with us - and we’re currently not able to return this
interest to customers at the level we aspire to.

Given the favourable FX result (which could be only a temporary benefit), we do not expect the
gross profit margin to remain this high throughout the remainder of FY24, but we do expect
that, overall, our gross profit margin will be higher for FY24 compared to FY23.

Expense growth in line with underlying business growth
Our gross profit allows us to fund significant investment in growing our operational and
corporate teams, and the investment in growth, such as product development and marketing,
whilst remaining highly profitable.




                                                                                              10
Administrative expenses increased by 38% in H1 FY24 to £296.5 million. Our employee
expenses grew 46% compared with H1 FY23, but 10% compared with H2 FY23. This reflects
the strong hiring through last year and a slower rate of hiring since the end of FY23. Our
headcount now sits at 5,353, as at 30 September 2023, which is 4% higher than at 31 March
2023, and 24% higher than 30 September 2022.

We will continue to grow our operational teams to support our customer driven demand for
onboarding, servicing and compliance processes. And we'll grow our product engineering
teams making smart investments for long term growth.

New customer growth continues to come predominantly through referrals, or 'word of mouth',
which is extremely beneficial to our customer acquisition cost. We have also continued to
invest in both established marketing activities and new mediums. We increased spend by 5% to
£19.3 million in the first six months, and were able to acquire customers more efficiently,
particularly in Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world, such as Brazil. As a result, we continued to
grow our active customer base by over 30% whilst maintaining an attractive return on
investment.

Expenses relating to consultancy and outsourced services increased by 37% to £39.5 million.
We have increased our usage of external vendors to support certain operational servicing
activities where this can be done at a lower cost whilst maintaining high service quality. The
increase also reflects the cost of audit and advisory services relating to regulatory and
compliance requirements as we continue to expand our geographic coverage and build a more
extensive product for customers.

Highly profitable with limited reliance on interest income
Our approach to profitability, and what we target over the medium term, is to take a significant
proportion of the gross profit that we generate and commit this towards investing for future
growth, and doing so with very limited reliance on income from interest rates. And we will do
this whilst maintaining an adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20%.

Our adjusted EBITDA for the period was £241.1 million, up from £91.6 million in H1 FY23. This is
equivalent to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 37% (H1 FY23: 22%).


                                                      H1 FY24          H1 FY23      Movement YoY

Income (£m)                                            656.0             416.1           58%

Adjusted EBITDA (£m)                                    241.1            91.6            163%

Adjusted EBITDA margin (%)                              36.7             22.0          14.7 pps


This higher adjusted EBITDA margin is primarily driven by interest income on customer
balances; we generated a gross yield of 3.7% in H1 FY24. Our guidance on adjusted EBITDA
margin has always been ‘at or above 20%’. With our FY23 results we shared a framework
outlining that we intend to use only the first percentage point of interest yield to meet our
adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of ‘at or above 20%’, and that we’d aim to share 80% of the
excess back with customers. As a result, with rates at c.4%, we would expect our adjusted
EBITDA margin to be c.4 percentage points higher than our underlying guide.



                                                                                                  11
The 37% adjusted EBITDA margin in H1 FY24 is much higher than this guided level, and a
function of two major drivers. First, we weren’t able to share the excess interest back with our
customers at the 80% level we aspire to per our framework, partly a function of what our
licences allow us to pay out in various regions; adjusted EBITDA margin would have been c.
29% if we had achieved this. The remaining outperformance was largely due to lower than
expected cost of sales and administrative expenses.

Profit before tax for the period increased to £194.3 million compared with £51.3 million in the
same period last year. Earnings per share increased by 3.7x to 14.1 pence per share.

As at 30 September 2023, we held £13.3 billion of cash and highly liquid investment grade
assets, up 16% from £11.5 billion at the end of FY23. This includes assets in respect of the
£12.3 billion of customer balances, which we hold in the form of various high quality assets. It
also includes £911.1 million of Corporate cash (£671.1 million at the end of FY23), with the
increase driven by the £228.1 million of free cash flow generated by the business (see
definition in appendix). On this basis, our free cash flow conversion rate for H1 FY24 was 95%
(85% in H1 FY23).

We are well capitalised for the future and as at 30 September 2023, our Group eligible capital
of £467.5 million was significantly above the minimum capital requirements set by our
regulators around the world. This has allowed us to continue our programme of purchasing
Wise shares through the employee benefit trust to reduce the dilutive impact of stock based
compensation. As we announced with our FY23 results, we have approvals for an additional
£60 million of capital for this purpose in FY24, and as at 30 September 2023 we have
completed £29 million of share purchases.

Our outlook for FY24 and beyond
We’re building a business with world class fundamentals. Our growth is customer-led and we’re
growing fast to capture more of a large market. We’re investing efficiently, in the build and
marketing of the Wise account and our Wise Platform which is helping us power our growth
with higher levels of profitability.

Our outlook, and financial guidance for FY24 and over the medium term are an outcome of
what our teams have built over recent years.

With our Q2 trading update in October 2023, we upgraded our income growth guidance for
FY24 to 33-38% (previously 28-33%), reflecting the strong start we have made to the year,
and our higher interest income expectations. This is despite us aiming to return more interest
to customers and the more challenging interest income comparative in the second half of the
year.

Our medium term guidance remains unchanged:
    Income to grow at a compound annual growth rate of >20% over the medium term
    We are targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin at or above 20% over the medium term

Independent review report to Wise plc
Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements

Our conclusion

We have reviewed Wise plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim
financial statements”) in the Unaudited interim results of Wise plc for the 6 month period ended
30 September 2023 (the “period”).

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim
financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted
International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.

The interim financial statements comprise:

   •   the Condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2023;
   •   the Condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period then
       ended;
   •   the Condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended;
   •   the Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period then ended; and
   •   the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.

The interim financial statements included in the Unaudited interim results of Wise plc have been
prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim
Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the
United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.

Basis for conclusion

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”).
A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures.

A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.

We have read the other information contained in the Unaudited interim results and considered
whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information
in the interim financial statements.




                                                                                                14
Conclusions relating to going concern

Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as
described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention
to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of
accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern
that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures
performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause
the group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review

Our responsibilities and those of the directors

The Unaudited interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of,
and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the
Unaudited interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules
sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Unaudited
interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for
assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors
either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Unaudited
interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going
concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in
the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been
prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
For the half-year ended 30 September 2023 (unaudited)

Note 1. Summary of significant accounting policies

1.1 General information

Wise plc (the "Company") is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England
(Registration number 13211214). These condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30
September 2023 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). The principal activity of
the Group is the provision of cross-border money transfer services. The address of its registered
office is 6th Floor Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JJ.

These condensed interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning
of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2023
were approved by the board of directors on 27 June 2023 and delivered to the Registrar of
Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an
emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under section 498 of the
Companies Act 2006.



1.2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group have been prepared in
accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'
and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial
Conduct Authority.

The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial
report. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2023, which has been
prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006, and any public announcements made by Wise plc during the interim
reporting period.

The accounting policies and presentation applied by the Group are consistent with those in the
previous financial year.

Going concern

The condensed financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are
satisfied that the Group has the available resources to continue in business for a period at least 12
months from approval of the interim financial statements. In making this assessment, the Directors
have considered severe downside scenarios to stress test the viability of the business.
These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and liquidity as
well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.




                                                                                                            23
The assessment indicated that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue its operations for a
period at least 12 months from approval of the interim financial statements and remained above its
minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.



1.3 Critical accounting areas of judgement and estimation

In preparing these interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported figures. Management assessed
that there were no material changes in the current period to the critical accounting estimates and
judgements, as disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.



Note 2. Segment information

Description of segment
The information regularly reported to the Board of Directors, who are considered to be the Chief
Operating Decision Maker, for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of
performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s business
model, the Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is
“Cross-border payment services”.

The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for this one reportable segment can be determined by
reference to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position. The
analysis of revenue by type of customers and geographical regions, is set out in note 3.

At the end of each period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise Payments Ltd
in the UK. Based on the location of the non-current asset, the following geographical breakdown of
non-current assets is prepared:

* The deferred tax charge for the period predominately relates to utilisation of losses.


Income tax expense for the current half-year period is calculated representing the best estimate of
the annual effective tax rate expected for the full year by geographical unit applied to the pre-tax
income of the six month period, which is then adjusted for tax on exceptional items.

The effective tax rate for the half-year ended 30 September 2023 is 28% (half-year ended 30
September 2022: 27%). The rate remains above the UK rate due to overseas profits taxed at higher
overseas tax rates.
