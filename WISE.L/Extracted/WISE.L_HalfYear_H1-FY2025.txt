         Unaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2024
                              Long term investments driving customer and volume growth

“We are pleased with the progress over the first six months of the year, with our key financial
metrics maintaining a healthy growth trajectory as we continue investing in the infrastructure
that will ultimately enable us to move trillions through our market-leading network.

As a result of these investments our infrastructure is developing quickly. This week we
launched our sixth live direct connection to a domestic payment system, this time in the
Philippines. This follows regulatory approvals to also integrate directly with the domestic
payment systems in Brazil and Japan, taking the number of direct connections to eight once
integrated.

Enhancing our infrastructure makes Wise increasingly efficient. 63% of transfers are now
completed instantly and reducing unit costs allowed us to lower prices with the average cross
border take rate at 62bps, 5bps lower than a year ago.

Our customers value the speed, convenience and price we offer, with over 70% of new
customers joining Wise through recommendations by existing customers. This drove another
six months of strong financial performance with YoY growth in active customers of 25%,
underlying income of 19%, cross border volume of 19% and a 31% increase in customer
holdings1.“
- Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer


Highlights for the six months ended 30 September 20242

We operate in a huge, expanding market, with a small but growing share
   ● Active customers increased by 25%; in H1 FY25 alone we helped 11.4m people and
      businesses move and manage their money around the world.
   ● Our customers moved £68.4bn with us in H1 FY25, an increase of 19% vs H1 FY24 (21%
      on a constant currency basis).

The value of our infrastructure is growing quickly, enhanced through our investments
   ● Instant payments delight our customers and make clear the quality of our network; 63%
       of payments were instant in Q2 FY25, 83% within an hour and 94% within 24 hours.
   ● Our operational capabilities and controls played a key role in receiving regulatory
       approval to directly integrate into the domestic payments systems in Brazil, Japan and
       the Philippines.

Customer centric product development driving an increasingly global proposition
   ● In the Philippines, alongside the launch of InstaPay, we also released the Wise Account
      as well as the ability to send money out of the country.
   ● Wise Platform welcomed nine new partners, including Nubank (Brazil), Qonto (France)
      and AbbeyCross (UK) during the period and this week we were also delighted to
      announce a new partnership with Standard Chartered.

An update from Kristo Kaarmann, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer
Our mission is to build the best way to move and manage the world’s money.

Over the last six months we continued to make progress on our long term journey, serving
11.4m active customers, that’s 2.8x growth over the last four years. This growth in customers
has driven cross border volume to grow by 2.9x over the last four years and was the main
driver behind a 3.4x increase in underlying income and a 7.7x increase in underlying profit
before tax.

We also continued to develop our global payments network in the period, enabling more instant
payments and lower pricing over time, whilst also delivering strong profitability and cash
generation.

Wise has the potential to move trillions rather than billions around the world
A massive problem continues to exist for people and businesses around the world; moving and
managing money internationally is still broken. It remains expensive, slow, inconvenient and
opaque.

The opportunity that comes with solving this problem is huge. We have less than 5% and 1%
share respectively in the expanding personal and Small-Medium Business (SMB) market
segments. Including the large enterprise segment of the market, the cross border market
across these three segments is estimated to be more than £27 trillion.

If we maintain our focus on this long-term opportunity, Wise has the potential to move trillions
rather than billions around the world as ‘the’ network for the world’s money for cross-border
transfers, as well as being the market leader in providing people and businesses with an
account that is truly international. With this opportunity will come increased expectations and
scrutiny from regulators, as we become more important to local financial systems. Therefore a
key part of achieving our potential will be continuing to invest in developing our global risk and
financial crime infrastructure.

Wise is still very early in its journey and its potential is substantial. We are laser focused on
delivering what’s needed to get us there.

An infrastructure that enables the instant movement of money around the world at the
lowest possible unit cost
We continue to deepen our infrastructure, enhancing how we operate across our network
which spans over 160 countries, with 40 currencies.

We hold over 65 licences and have six direct connections to local payment systems currently
live, both of which allow us to significantly simplify operations, increasing speed and reducing
costs. Where we have not yet deepened our infrastructure with direct connections, we operate
with a robust network with over 90 local bank gateways for redundancy to ensure the reliability
of our service.

So far in this fiscal year we’ve been delighted to receive a number of additional regulatory
approvals.




                                                                                                    4
Firstly, in India, we secured approvals to further unlock outward transfers, removing a previous
USD 5,000 cap. This allows us to improve our proposition and grow our customer share in
India, which is expected to help us reduce the cost of sending to and from India over time.

Secondly, in Australia, we have been granted an Australian Financial Services Licence for
Investments, enabling us to bring our investment product ‘Assets’ to Australia later this year.

In addition to these approvals, we were also delighted to be given approval in Brazil and Japan
to begin integrating with their respective domestic payment systems. Once integrated, these
will bring our tally of such integrations to eight having also recently launched the Philippines
direct connection.

These connections give us full end-to-end control of the payment network. They are typically
multi-year projects and complex integrations but once fully rolled out to all of our customers,
they enable payments that are consistently instant and are expected to reduce bank and
partner fees significantly.

As we shared in June, we’re pleased that we’re realising a return on our investments in our
infrastructure. 63% of transfers are instant on our network. This means they go from source to
destination account in less than 20 seconds end to end. This is something we are very proud of
and is something we believe is unique to Wise. Our unit costs are also scaling, allowing us to
invest in reducing prices. In Q2 FY25 our average cross border take rate was 8bps lower YoY at
59bps, entering Q3 FY25 slightly below this level.

Our investments in enhancing our infrastructure lead to outcomes like this in speed and price
and we remain committed to investing in our infrastructure to further improve these over time.

It’s reasonable to expect that in ten years, someone can transfer $10,000 across currencies for
$10, compared to the current banks’ price of $200-$400. We intend Wise to be the one
operating these transactions at that price point, with our cost base brought down to $5 or less.
It will be profitable and very valuable, when the cross-border volume on our platform is in the
trillions.

We won’t be able to achieve this level of efficiency overnight. Nor will the customer response
be immediate as we iterate prices, but we believe it’s inevitable that the lowest priced provider
with the best experience will win the scale needed over time to become one of the most
valuable providers of financial services in the world.

Our customer growth continues to be word-of-mouth led, thanks to us building products
that customers love, at prices worth talking about
With the Wise Account, Wise Business, and Wise Platform, we serve millions of people, small
businesses, financial institutions and enterprises all over the world.

With continued investment in features to make our customers’ lives easier, combined with low
cost, fast payments, the quality of our account speaks for itself. We consistently see around
two-thirds of new customers join us through word-of-mouth from existing customers. This
sustained virality allows us to acquire customers at a low cost, further reinforcing the strength
of the platform.

As we’ve built and launched more features to help people and businesses move and manage
their money, adoption of the account has continued to increase. In Q2 FY25, 53% of active


                                                                                                    5
personal customers used multiple features of the Wise Account, up from 44% in Q2 FY24. For
businesses, this adoption rate was 60%, up from 58% in Q2 FY24.

More customers using the account features has led to an increase in customer holdings with
Wise too. As at 30 September 2024 customers held £18.5bn with us, 31% higher than this time
last year and this includes over £3.8bn of funds in the ‘Assets’ feature4.

As we enhance our infrastructure, develop our products and reduce pricing, we see a greater
number of Wise Platform partners choosing Wise to help them and their customers with their
cross border needs.

In the last six months we began new Wise Platform partnerships with Nubank (Brazil), Qonto
(France) and AbbeyCross (UK). Most recently we were delighted to announce a partnership
with Standard Chartered to power the bank’s cross-border payment service, SC Remit,
enabling their customers in Asia and in the Middle East to send money in 21 currencies
including USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, SGD, HKD, JPY in a matter of seconds.

We’re confident in the outlook for the second half of the year and beyond
Over the last six months we’ve made important steps in the enhancement of our infrastructure
which are going to contribute to further improvements to speed and unit cost over time. Wise
will become increasingly faster, cheaper and more convenient: an ideal infrastructure partner
via Wise Platform.

To make this vision a reality, now is the time to invest in long term growth.

We expect the investments in pricing in the first half of FY25 to move us closer to achieving our
target underlying profit before tax margin range of 13-16% in H2 FY25, from an elevated
position of 22% in the first half.

We are making very fast progress on our mission. Just over a year ago we had four direct
connections and today we are very close to having twice this number live, with all the benefits
that flow from this. With further investments planned, I’m more confident than ever that Wise is
on the path to creating an exceptionally valuable company for customers and shareholders.

A financial update from Emmanuel, our newly appointed CFO
Wise’s mission is very clear, and we are investing in the infrastructure and products customers
need to move and manage their money around the world. Over time this will enable Wise to
become ‘the’ network for the world's money.

This strategy is working: over 11m customers used Wise for cross border transactions in the
last six months, 25% more than the prior year, and with many customers increasingly using
Wise as the solution for banking internationally.

This has resulted in a strong financial performance for the period with 19% underlying income
growth and high levels of profitability with an underlying profit before tax margin of 22%. This
margin was temporarily elevated above our target range of 13-16%, due to the timing of price
investments which, having been made in H1, will reduce the margin towards our target range in
H2 FY25.

More customers, using more products: the main driver of 19% underlying income growth
In the first six months, over 25% more active customers used Wise to send or convert money
internationally. Of the 11.4m active customers in H1 FY25, 10.8m were personal customers (25%
YoY) and 523k were business customers (+11% YoY).

Business customer growth has been lighter over the last year due to the impact of pausing of
onboarding in the UK and EU in the second half of FY24. We have been open to new customers
again in these markets since the beginning of FY25 and have seen some improvement in
growth as a result.

Our customers sent or converted £68.4bn of volume in H1 FY25. This is a 19% increase on last
year (21% increase on a constant currency basis), with growth in volumes continuing to be
driven by higher numbers of active customers.

Compared to volume growth of 19%, revenue from cross border transactions grew 9% to
£419.1m for the period, as we reinvested efficiency gains through lower pricing to drive further
growth. This is only possible thanks to our long term investments in infrastructure and a
relentless focus on efficiency. In doing so, we were able to reduce the cross border take rate
5bps compared to the prior year, from 67bps to 62bps.

Wise Account adoption is driving a wider use of products, higher rates of customer activity and
retention. Card and other revenue (predominantly interchange revenue) increased by 52% to
£172.8m, while customers balances held in the Wise Account grew 20% £14.7bn, the first 1%
yield on which contributed £70.5m to underlying income in the period (up 23%, in line with
average balances).

As a result, underlying income grew 19% to £662.4m, representing a CAGR of 36% over the
last four years.

Underlying gross profit margin representing capacity for investment
Underlying gross profit grew 30% to £505.0m benefiting from higher revenue from active
customer growth, Wise Account adoption and a temporarily higher price for cross border
services ahead of reinvesting unit cost reductions.




                                                                                                   7
The underlying gross profit margin was 76% in H1 FY25 as cost of sales as a proportion of
underlying income reduced from 30% to 24% YoY in H1 FY25, driven by c.3ppt of efficiency
gains due to operational improvements and c.3ppt variability in some cost types that were
temporarily lower in the period, such as FX costs.

Much of the excess underlying gross profit margin, amount deemed to be sustainable, was
reinvested into pricing reductions through the first half of the year, with a lower underlying
gross profit margin therefore anticipated in H2 FY25.

Expense growth in line with business growth
Our underlying gross profit allows us to remain highly profitable while also allowing us to fund
significant investment in our operational and corporate teams, and to fund investment in growth
through product development, marketing, and improved levels of service.

Administrative expenses increased by 24% in H1 FY25 to £366.7m as we continue to invest in
current and future growth opportunities. Within this, third party costs increased faster than
employee benefit expenses as we continue to use a portfolio of specialist outsourcing
providers for specific elements of servicing customers, allowing us to flex capacity up and
down more quickly, at a lower cost, but with the same high standards being applied.

In line with our expectations, we have grown the number of Wisers to over 6,000 by the end of
the first half of FY25. These Wisers help us on our mission; building products, improving our
infrastructure, supporting our core functions and helping to attract and serve even more
customers.

Highly profitable with limited reliance on interest income
In the first half of FY25 we generated an underlying profit before tax of £147.1m, a 57%
increase over last year with an underlying profit before tax margin that remained elevated at
22%.

Our ‘interest income above the first 1% yield’ was £230.2m in the period, up 49% on the prior
year as a result of the 23% growth in average customer balances and, on average, higher
central bank rates.

In calculating our IFRS profit before tax, we add this additional interest income to our
underlying profit before tax and deduct the value of ‘benefits paid relating to customer
balances’ of £84.8m.

As per our interest income framework, of this £230.2m of interest income, it is intended for
20% (£46.0m) to be retained while aiming to return the remaining 80% (£184.2m) to
customers. We partly achieved this with £84.8m being paid to customers in the period, leaving
£99.4m which was incidentally retained, the majority of which relates to the UK where we are
currently unable to directly pay interest to Wise Account holders under the terms of our
licence.

Reported profit before tax increased significantly to £292.5m with earnings per share for the
six months at 21.1p.

Strong and growing balance sheet
As at 30 September 2024, we held £15.9bn of cash and highly liquid investment grade assets,
up 10% from £14.5bn at the end of FY2024. This includes assets in respect of the £14.7bn of


                                                                                                 8
customer balances. It also includes £1.1bn of our ‘own cash’ (£1.1bn at the end of FY2024), with
the increase from our operating performance largely offset by a reduction in our rolling credit
facility drawings as we repaid the debt finance given our strong cash position.

We are well capitalised for the future and as at 30 September 2024, our Group eligible capital
was £883.0m (excluding un-audited FY25 profits), significantly above our minimum regulatory
capital requirements.

Our capital position, built through sustained profitability, enabled us to initiate a programme in
FY23 to reduce the dilutive impact on share count that arises through issuing new stock to
satisfy stock based compensation. We expect to deploy c.£70m through this programme in
FY25, purchasing shares to cover new grants throughout the year and as at 30 September
2024 we have completed £34.6m of share purchases.

Our outlook for FY25 and beyond
We’re building a business with world class fundamentals with the potential to scale volumes
from billions to trillions, generating exceptional value for both the customers and owners of
Wise.

With the initiation of what we hope to be a progression of price reductions as we drive towards
this mission, we continue to expect underlying income growth of 15-20% in both FY25 and over
the medium term from FY24.

We also continue to target a medium term underlying profit margin of between 13-16%, a range
that we expect to move closer to achieving in the second half of FY25.

UK listing reforms
In July, the FCA introduced reforms to the UK listing regime, replacing the premium listing
segment with the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) Category (ESCC) and revising the UK
listing rules. Wise's listing was automatically transferred from the standard listing segment onto
the Equity Shares (Transition) Category.

To be eligible to step up to the ESCC, in addition to needing FCA approval to transfer, Wise
would also need to amend certain parts of its Articles of Association, subject to approval from
shareholders.

The Board is consulting extensively with shareholders and will provide an update in due course.

On behalf of the Board of directors:



Kristo Käärmann, Director
Date: 6 November 2024




                                                                                                   11
Independent review report to Wise plc
Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements

Our conclusion
We have reviewed Wise plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim
financial statements”) in the Unaudited interim results of Wise plc for the six month period
ended 30 September 2024 (the “period”).

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK
adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority.

The interim financial statements comprise:

   ·   the Condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2024;
   ·   the Condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period then
       ended;
   ·   the Condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended;
   ·   the Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period then ended; and
   ·   the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.

The interim financial statements included in the Unaudited interim results of Wise plc have
been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim
Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the
United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.

Basis for conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of
the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK)
2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures.

A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.

We have read the other information contained in the Unaudited interim results and considered
whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
information in the interim financial statements.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as
described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention
to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of
accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern



                                                                                                12
that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures
performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause
the group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review

Our responsibilities and those of the directors
The Unaudited interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of,
and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the
Unaudited interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules
sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Unaudited
interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for
assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors
either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the
Unaudited interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions
relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit
procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report,
including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of
complying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United
Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
For the half-year ended 30 September 2024 (unaudited)

Note 1. Summary of material accounting policies

1.1 General information

Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England
(Registration number 13211214). These condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30
September 2024 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’). The principal activity of the
Group is the provision of cross-border and domestic financial services. The address of its registered
office is 6th Floor Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JJ.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts
within the meaning of sections 434(3) and 435(3) of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for
the year ended 31 March 2024 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 13 June 2024
and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was
unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under
section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.



1.2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group have been prepared in
accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'
and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial
Conduct Authority.

The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial
report. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024, which has been
prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006, and any public announcements made by Wise plc during the interim
reporting period.

The accounting policies and presentation applied by the Group are consistent with those in the
previous financial year.

Going concern

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the
Directors are satisfied that the Group has the available resources to continue in business for a period
of at least 12 months from approval of the interim financial statements. In making this assessment, the
Directors have considered severe downside scenarios to stress test the viability of the business.
These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and liquidity as
well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.




                                                                                                            21
The assessment indicated that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue its operations and meet
its financial obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from approval of the interim
financial statements and remained above its minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.



1.3 Critical accounting areas of judgement and estimation

In preparing these interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported figures. Management assessed that
there were no material changes in the current period to the critical accounting estimates and
judgements, as disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts.



Note 2. Segment information

Description of segment
The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment. The information regularly reported to the Chief
Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’), which is currently the Board of Directors of the Group, for the
purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall
activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s business model, the Group has determined that it has only
one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is provision of cross-border and domestic financial
services.

The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for the reportable segment can be determined by reference to
the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of revenue
by type of customer and geographical region is set out in note 3.

At the end of each reporting period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise’s
operations in the UK. Based on the location of the non-current asset, the following geographical
breakdown of non-current assets is prepared:



                                                                       As at 30

Income tax expense for the current half-year period is calculated representing the best estimate of
the annual effective tax rate expected for the full year by geographical unit applied to the pre-tax
income of the six month period, which is then adjusted for tax on exceptional items.

The effective tax rate for the half-year ended 30 September 2024 is 26% (half-year ended 30
September 2023: 28%). The rate remains marginally above the UK rate due to non-deductible
employee option plans and differences in overseas tax rates.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting published on 20 December 2021 introduced the Pillar Two model rules
designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy. The Pillar
Two regulation provides for an international framework of rules aimed at ensuring that worldwide profits
of multinational groups are subject to tax at a rate not lower than 15% in every jurisdiction in which a
group operates.

The Group operates in the United Kingdom (amongst other locations), which has enacted new legislation
to implement the global minimum top-up taxes. The first period for which enacted legislation is effective
for the Group is the year ended 31 March 2025.

The Group has performed an assessment of the Group’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. This
calculation is based on the accounting data for the first half of fiscal year 2025. Based on the calculation,
the Group does not expect any material top-up taxes under enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two
legislation. The Group will continue to monitor and assess the application of these rules to The Group.

Basic EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the Group’s owners by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, including, for the period
to 30 September 2024, the ordinary shares issuable for no consideration for which all conditions are
satisfied (24.3m shares as at 30 September 2024).

Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from both basic and
diluted EPS calculations. At the end of the reporting period, there were 19.7m (30 September 2023:
28.9m) shares held in the ESOP Trust.

The diluted EPS calculation adjusts the weighted average number of shares used in the basic EPS
calculation by assuming all potentially dilutive shares convert into ordinary shares. Rights granted to
employees under employee share award plans, with a strike price and/or with conditions which have
not yet been met, are considered to be potential dilutive shares and therefore have been included in
the calculation of diluted EPS.

Cash at banks, in hand and in transit between Group bank accounts include term deposits of £352.4m
(2024: £285.8). Their settlement date is three months or less.

Of the £11,899.0m (31 March 2024: £10,479.2m) cash and cash equivalents at the period end,
£1,061.2m (31 March 2024: £1,061.1m) is considered the corporate cash balance, which is not related
to customer funds that are held in Wise accounts or collected from customers as part of the money
transfer settlement process. Refer to the APM section for further details.

The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to
customer funds. Such requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. As at 30 September 2024, the Group held £5,151.6m (2024: £5,290.5m) of customer funds as
cash in segregated, safeguarding bank accounts at investment grade banking institutions and term
deposits. The remainder of safeguarded customer deposits were held across highly liquid global money
market funds (MMFs), treasury bonds and investment grade corporate paper, as allowed by local
regulations. In addition during the period to 30 September 2024, the Group has introduced a hybrid
approach to safeguarding customer funds by implementing Safeguarding via Comparable Guarantees
with nine investment-grade sureties. The total value of the guarantees are £520.0m.

The Group retains its access to a £400.0m multi-currency debt facility offered by a syndicate of eight
lenders, namely: HSBC Innovation Banking Limited, National Westminster Bank Plc, Citibank N.A.,
London Branch, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC,
Barclays Bank Plc, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., and The Governor and Company of the Bank
of Ireland (‘the RCF’). The currency denomination, maturity date, interest rate, covenant and security
terms of the RCF remain consistent with that disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts 2024. The
Group has complied with the financial covenants throughout the reporting period. During the period to
30 September 2024, the Group fully repaid the outstanding balance of this facility and the undrawn
amount of the facility as at 30 September 2024 is £400.0m (31 March 2024: £200.0m).

During the period to 30 September 2024, the Group recognised £34.4m of lease liability, and the
corresponding right of use of assets, for a new office facility that was previously disclosed as a capital
commitment in the notes to the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts.
