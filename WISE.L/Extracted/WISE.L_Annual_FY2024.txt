While overall volumes grew by 13%, the average volume
per customer reduced by 12% to £9,232 over the year.
The success of the Wise Account has led to many customers
using the card-only for their cross border needs and this
typically has a lower level of volume per customer, reducing
the average year on year. See the CFO report on page 36 for
further detail on what is driving this change.

Increasing representation
We’re also continuing to build out our support for ethnic
minority talent, and improve neurodiversity and disability
inclusion, to help increase our representation.

We’re developing a detailed race and ethnicity representation
dashboard to give us a clearer picture of representation at
Wise. This will help us set representation benchmarks and
goals for FY2025 and beyond.

Nurturing our Wise Communities
We have 12 global Wise Communities (Employee Resource
Groups) with close to 4,000 members who actively help us
drive our diversity, equity and inclusion progress. In FY2024,
they hosted 30+ events to build stronger connections across
Wise and the wider fintech industry.

removals from TIST, a forestation program, and Trees for Global

Brazil, we purchased carbon removal credits from the Pratigi

project, aimed at recovering degraded areas in the southern
region of Bahia State.

In FY2025, we look to continue investing in projects in key
markets that align with our product operations, such as Brazil
and others in the APAC or MEA regions.

Measuring our carbon footprint
Since FY2023, the primary metric we have been tracking
in measuring our carbon footprint is revenue intensity.
It measures how much CO₂e Wise emits per unit of revenue
earned, helping to better distinguish between business
growth and emission growth. As a business that continues to
expand substantially, we believe revenue intensity is a more
accurate representation of our emissions. We also look at
headcount intensity that measures how much Co₂e Wise
emits for each person it employs.

     Our stakeholders and
     Section 172 (1) statement
     The relationship between the Wise Group and our stakeholders remains fundamental to the strategy, purpose and values of our
     business and drives our decision-making.

     The Board is required by Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 to act in a way that would be most likely to promote
     the long-term success of the Company and take into account all of Wise’s stakeholders in its decision-making. The Board
     directly and indirectly (through the LT and others delegated by the Board) sought to understand the interests and priorities
     of these stakeholders.

     The following table comprises our Section 172(1) statement, setting out how, in performing its duties over the course of the year,
     the Board has had regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006, alongside examples of
     how each of our key stakeholders have been considered and engaged with. Further information can also be found throughout
     the Strategic report and the Corporate Governance report on pages 84-95.

Three lines of defence
Our three lines of defence (3LOD) model continues to serve us well in managing risks by establishing clear accountability
for risk owners.


First Line of Defence


    The first line of defence consists of the business units that generate the risks for Wise, and are responsible for identifying
    the key mitigating controls and actions to manage these risks. Whilst all Wisers have a responsibility to manage the
    risks we take, our first line teams are more specifically defined as those individual tribes and squads directly responsible
    for performing day-to-day business activities and delivering our products or services to customers. First line’s primary
    role is to identify, assess, and manage risks that may arise as a result of the work they do. This line is also responsible
    for designing and implementing controls; adhering to policies and procedures; and monitoring risks at the operational
    level. In the risk process the first line also has to articulate the effectiveness of the control environment.These Wisers
    are our frontline. They have the most detailed knowledge of the risks and controls specific to their day-to-day work,
    and the actions to manage them.




Second Line of Defence


    Global Risk Management and Compliance oversight teams. This function enables the identification of emerging risks in
    daily operation of the business by providing frameworks, policies, tools, and techniques to support risk and compliance
    management. They have the ability to view risks at aggregate as well as granular level to help improve the visibility to
    interconnected risks as well as advise proactively on patterns and themes requiring attention. They are independent to
    the first line, with the ability to provide adequate challenge, oversight and support to ensure risks are well understood,
    assessed and managed in line with the risk appetites set by the Board. They are responsible for establishing and
    maintaining a risk management framework, developing policies and advising on procedures, supporting risk assessments,
    and advising and monitoring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and internal policies. The second line also
    monitors and reports on risk exposures and the effectiveness of our controls.




Third Line of Defence


    Internal Audit. This team operates independently from second line risk and compliance teams, and our first line teams.
    Our internal auditors objectively evaluate the effectiveness of our risk management processes and provide assurance
    to leaders and the Wise Group Board as to whether these are operating as they should. They assess the overall control
    environment, identify control gaps or weaknesses, areas of non-compliance and issue findings for required improvements.
    Internal audit also reviews the implementation of risk management practices and compliance with policies and regulations.

     Emerging and strategic risks
     Our vigilance around our risk environment includes monitoring potential risks that could emerge and cause harm or present
     challenges to our business, our employees and our customers. Emerging risks are defined as material, highly uncertain risks
     that do not meaningfully impact Wise today but are unpredictable in nature and could evolve rapidly and unexpectedly to
     become principal risks.

     These are some of the emerging risks we are currently monitoring.

     Risk                                         Description
     Increased geopolitical uncertainty           Wise's mission means we are exposed to potential risks arising from global

                                                  financial crime and sanctions, security risks as well as business continuity risks and
                                                  if these were to eventuate, it could impair or restrict our ability to operate in certain
                                                  markets. To mitigate this risk, we closely monitor global events on an ongoing basis
                                                  and take actions to proactively manage our business and serve our customers as
                                                  effectively as possible.

     Artificial intelligence                      Artificial intelligence (including the use of large language models) is a fast evolving
                                                  and potential transformational technology. It’s too early to predict the full impact
                                                  and potential risks that will emerge with the evolution of this technology. There
                                                  may be areas such as cybersecurity and fraud where this technology may be
                                                  misused to create more sophisticated and harder to detect risks and we will
                                                  continue to monitor developments in this area.

                                                  With greater adoption of AI across the financial services industry, in terms of both
                                                  improving controls as well as operations, there are additional risks that may arise
                                                  as a result. The changing regulatory perception of AI, operational risks, model
                                                  failure risks as well as transparency and governance are potential areas we see
                                                  this could have an impact. As a result we are taking a measured and thoughtful
                                                  approach to the use of this technology in order to strengthen our controls and
                                                  improve the customer experience and are developing appropriate measures as
                                                  needed to manage any associated risks.



     Looking ahead                                                       we operate. With the support of new tools enabling greater

     Compliance Risk – Regulatory Risk continued
      Globally, the range of regulatory requirements Wise must
      meet is dynamic, with regulators and policymakers in
      different jurisdictions introducing new or modified
      requirements over time. We need to identify those changes
      early on and implement them. Regulatory risks could result
      in regulatory penalties and impede our ability to grow
      operations, maintain licences and/or expand market
      offerings. We strive to abide by all regulatory obligations at
      all times. In the event that gaps are identified, we aim to
      remediate these promptly and (where appropriate)
      informing key regulators. We have a global view towards
      compliance, and continue to invest in global and regional
      teams, processes and infrastructure to meet these demands.

      Overall, the complexity of the regulatory risk landscape
      we operate within continues to increase because of:

      • Expansion into new markets and products. We anticipate
        further challenges with new markets and their local
        regulation yet to be exposed to the products that we offer
        at scale. In some jurisdictions, the regulatory environment
        that governs our products is still evolving and our product
        offering may be unique.
      • Increasing regulatory scrutiny for our existing markets.
        As our volumes, customer base and number of transactions
        grow, we face an increased volume of regulatory
        engagements and requests for information. We satisfy these
        by providing information and materials in a timely manner,
        as well as by giving clarifications promptly as required.
      • Ongoing regulatory change. We deploy horizon scanning
        globally to ensure that we are aware of developments in
        regulation, making changes to adhere to the new regulatory
        requirements. During FY2024 (and ongoing) we observed
        an increase in Operational Resilience requirements in the
        EEA, Australia and the UK, which is becoming a focus
        area for regulators globally. We anticipate that further
        investment is needed in this area.

     Compliance Risk – Conduct Risk

 personal loans, corporate loans or mortgages – which are
 key products open to credit risk.

 Our credit risk exposures mainly arise from the placement of
 customer and corporate funds with partner banks and
 counterparties, as either cash deposits or investments or
 receivables arising from the receipt of customer funds by
 partners. In the event of default by one or more of these
 counterparties, we are at risk of financial losses as these
 funds might become unrecoverable.

 To mitigate credit risk, we aim to only partner with high-
 quality counterparties, including banks and non-bank
 institutions. Generally, we use available public credit ratings
 issued by internationally recognised credit rating agencies
 to assess the credit quality of our partners as part of the
 initial due diligence and ongoing review process.

 For counterparties without such public credit ratings, we
 have an internal credit assessment process performed
 through analysing the financial and other information of the
 counterparty or referring to external consensus ratings if
 available.

 Credit risk exposure is monitored at a counterparty level and
 overall portfolio against our risk appetite. This is then
 reported as part our internal risk governance process.

         To execute this, we focus on a number of key metrics
         including our NPS score, customer feedback and our
         regulatory environment during the design stage. We also
         ensure rigorous challenge and feedback is undertaken on
         our solutions to customer problems and how these
         solutions are contributing to our mission.

         We stagger the release of new products, starting

         customers, and eventually expanding to more customers.
         In doing so, we aim to make the universal implementation

         We use data to capture the direct and indirect effects on
         our customers as a result of any changes we make. We
         have a dedicated team monitoring the rate of customers
         contacting us, as this helps us to understand where our

include, but are not limited to:

• operating cost reductions to align the cost base with
  any suppressed volumes, for example limiting hiring or
  salary increases
• reduced customer acquisition marketing spend
• reduced benefits paid to customers
• raising fees charged to customers

Reverse stress test
The Directors also reviewed the results of the reverse stress
testing performed to provide an illustration of the customer
activity decline in the case of an unpredictable but significant
event that would result in Wise no longer being viable.
This, specifically, would be the earlier of: insufficient working
capital, insufficient regulatory capital, or insufficient
regulatory liquidity resources. The scenario demonstrated
that the Group’s operating model can sustain a material
reversal in volume growth alongside continued investment
in operating costs in line with our growth plan.

The stress scenario is deemed implausible as (a) Wise has
grown volumes consistently year over year through all stages
of the business cycle, (b) Wise has a strong base of existing
customers, and (c) investment is going into improving and
expanding the products and services we offer. Furthermore,
management would have warning signs of the volume and
profitability deterioration as costs rise ahead of revenue
growth. Any warning signs would be identified and escalated
appropriately as part of management reporting and internal
monitoring processes, which include regular capital and
liquidity monitoring. This process would give sufficient time to
implement appropriate management action to extend the
viability period.

Incoming CFO – Emmanuel Thomassin
We are delighted with the appointment of Emmanuel
Tomassin who will commence in the role of CFO in October
2024.

His starting salary will be £500,000. The Committee believes
that this is an appropriate salary level in the context of
Emmanuel’s skills and experience, his ability to drive growth
at Wise, and the importance of offering a competitive salary.
Matt Briers’ salary at the time of his departure was £402,000,
but as stated in our FY2023 annual report, we planned to
increase his salary to £482,400 (i.e., by 20%) in FY2024 to
bring it more in line with market. Therefore, Emmanuel’s salary
represents only a 3.6% increase on the salary that Matt would
have received should he have remained in role.
106    Governance      Remuneration Committee report continued



      Another significant enhancement in 2023 was the
      implementation of a revised stock allocation strategy for our
      employees. Beginning July 2023, new Wisers receive an
      annual stock grant, offering greater flexibility and alignment
      with our performance review process. Existing Wisers are
      transitioning to this new system, gradually receiving annual
      stock grants as their current 4-year grants vest. Equity
      ownership in the business is considered extremely important
      from a cultural perspective – it ensures every Wiser has a
      personal stake in the business and is therefore motivated to
      deliver in line with the mission and business strategy. We are
      proud that 100% of Wisers on permanent employment
      arrangements hold equity in the business.

      The Remuneration Committee seeks to take a measured and
      responsible approach to executive pay, considering decisions
      from the perspective of all our stakeholders as well as the
      external environment. This includes understanding the
      strategy and approach to reward for other Wisers. The
      Committee receives regular updates from the Chief People
      Officer and Head of Reward on recruitment and reward
      matters and how these align with the wider organisation, and
      is mindful of these when making decisions on executive pay.

      Whilst the Remuneration Committee did not specifically
      engage with Wisers on Executive Director remuneration
      during FY2024, we are continuing to build out our employee
      engagement plan to ensure that Wisers’ views are considered
      with regards to the Remuneration Policy and its
      implementation. Also, the Board held more general employee
      engagement sessions with Wisers during the financial year,
      as detailed on page 43 of this report.

      AGM
      On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to
      thank Wise owners for their input and engagement in the
      year. We remain dedicated to continuous and open dialogue
      with our shareholders and proxy advisers, and would
      welcome any comments you may have on the DRR.

      I hope that having read the information in this report, and
      considering Wise’s performance during FY2024, you will vote
      in favour of this Remuneration report at the 2024 AGM.

      If you would like to discuss any aspect of this Remuneration
      report, I would be happy to hear from you. You can contact
      me through the Company Secretary, at cosec@wise.com, and
      I will also be available at the 2024 AGM to answer any
      questions.

      On behalf of the Remuneration Committee and the Board,

      1. The Committee has not historically awarded annual bonuses.




           Consideration of the UK Corporate Governance Code principles
           Our Policy has been designed taking into account the following principles:

            Clarity                    The Policy is designed to be simple and support long-term, sustainable performance. It
                                       clearly sets out each element of remuneration, the limits in terms of quantum, and the
                                       discretions the Committee has.

            Simplicity                 Remuneration structures are simple and aligned to UK norms. They also incorporate
                                       structural features to ensure strong alignment to performance and strategy and minimise
                                       the risk of rewarding failure.

            Risk                       The Policy discourages inappropriate risk-taking through a focus on long-term incentives,
                                       the use of post-vesting holding periods, and malus and clawback provisions. When

                                       account of associated risks and liaises with the Audit and Risk Committee as necessary.

            Predictability             The potential reward outcomes are easily quantifiable and set out in the illustrations
                                       provided in the Policy.

            Proportionality            Incentive outcomes are contingent on successfully meeting stretching performance targets
                                       aligned to the delivery of the Company’s strategy, and the Committee retains discretion to
                                       override formulaic outturns.

            Alignment to culture       The Policy encourages long term shareholding, which is aligned with the Company culture
                                       and mission. Performance measures reflect our KPIs.

      2. As set out in the Prospectus, Matthew Briers holds awards over Class A Shares under the legacy share plans which were operated by the
         Company prior to Admission. At the date of this report, this comprises 236,366 Class A Shares in relation to unvested legacy share options,
         1,469,510 vested but not exercised legacy share options and 568,750 Class A Shares in relation to outstanding unvested legacy share awards.

         (‘WPL A Shares’). In preparation for Admission, these were exchanged for options over Class A Shares in Wise. The options resulting from the
         exchange, effected on 22 June 2021, comprised an option over 923,000 Class A Shares and an option over 572,000 Class A Shares for David
         Wells and Ingo Uytdenhaag respectively.

Matt Briers’ leaving arrangements
Matt stepped down from his role as a Board Director and CFO on 25 March 2024. Full details of his remuneration arrangements
in connection with his departure were disclosed in the FY2023 Directors’ Remuneration Report. In summary, he was treated as a
good leaver in respect of his FY2023 and FY2024 PSP awards to reflect his contribution to Wise during his employment as well
as the context for his departure. His FY2023 and FY2024 PSP awards will vest in line with the normal vesting date (on a pro-rata
basis to reflect the percentage of the performance period Matt is employed), to the extent the performance conditions attached
to the award are fulfilled. The two-year post-vesting holding period will continue to apply. In addition, Matt’s pre-IPO share
options award vested on a pro-rated basis until his last day of employment.

Matt is also subject to a two-year post-employment shareholding requirement of 300% of salary, as per our Remuneration
Policy.

      Change in remuneration of Wisers and directors
      The table below sets out how the change in reported remuneration for each Director between FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024
      compares to the change in average pay for employees of Wise Payments Limited, where the majority of our UK colleagues are
      employed. No Directors or employees currently receive annual bonuses.

      The relevant regulations prescribe that the above comparison should include all employees of the Parent Company. However,
      since there are no individuals employed by Wise plc except for the Executive Directors, a representative comparison has instead
      been formulated using all UK-based employees of Wise Payments Limited as the basis for this calculation. The average change
      for these employees has been calculated on a full-time equivalent basis, by reference to pay received for the relevant full
      financial year (excluding any share award vesting). The salary increase includes changes made through the annual salary review
      as well as additional changes made to reflect, for example, promotions or role changes. The change to the level of taxable
      benefits between FY2023 and FY2024 has been driven by higher average take-up of the benefits offering in FY2024 and an
      increase in our UK medical benefit premium.

                                                                                           Salary/fees          Benefits       Salary/fees          Benefits

      1. Percentage change based on annualised Executive and Non-Executive Director emoluments in FY2022 vs FY2023 and FY2023 vs FY2024.
         The FY2023 comparison therefore includes a notional amount for the period of FY2022 before Admission on 7 July 2021. The table reports on
         full-time equivalent figures for Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
      2. The benefits increase for Kristo Käärmann between FY2022 and FY2023 was reflective of a one-off payment made to Kristo to cover benefit in
         kind taxes of £898. There were no taxable benefits paid to Non-Executive Directors in either year.
      3. Terri Duhon joined the Board on 1 January 2022. Her fee for FY2022 has been calculated on an FTE basis for the purpose of this comparison.
      4. Alastair Rampell has voluntarily waived all fees in relation to his appointment as a NED of the Company.
      5. The significant change in fees for Non-Executive Directors is driven by transitioning all Wise NEDs to the Policy fee structure. David Wells, Ingo
         Uytdehaage, Clare Gilmartin and Hooi Ling Tan received a nominal fee of £1 per annum up to 28 February 2023 as remuneration for their duties
         for the Company. After such date, David Wells’ fee increased to £275,000 per annum (as Chairman) and fees for Ingo Uytdehaage, Clare
         Gilmartin and Hooi Ling Tan increased to £170,000 per annum.
      6. Elizabeth Chambers was appointed to the Board on 19 April 2023, so no comparison to prior year fees is available.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or
not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The key audit matter below is consistent with last year.

      1. The merger reserve arises from the Group pre-listing reorganisation accounted for as a capital reorganisation. Upon the reorganisation, the
         Group’s Ordinary Shares have been represented as those of Wise plc. The difference between Wise Payments Limited net assets and the
         nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the merger reserve.
      2. Other reserves predominantly relate to investments into highly liquid bonds measured at FVOCI. For these investments, changes in fair value are
         accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. On disposal of these debt investments, any related balance within the FVOCI reserve is
         reclassified to profit or loss. During the year £10.9m of fair value gains were recognised in other comprehensive income (2023: fair value losses
         of £5.5m), including £3.5m of tax credit (2023: £2.4m tax charge). Refer to note 10 for further information on the tax recognised on bonds.

      Notes to the Group
      consolidated financial statements
      For the year ended 31 March 2024


      Note 1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
      1.1 General information
      Wise plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in England. The address of its registered
      office is 6th Floor, Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JJ. The principal activity of the Company and its
      subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) is the provision of cross-border and domestic financial services. Further information on the Group’s
      operations and principal activities is presented in the Strategic Report.

      1.2 Accounting information and policies
      Introduction
      This section describes the basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group’s accounting policies
      that are applicable to the financial statements as a whole. The Group’s material accounting policies and critical accounting
      estimates and judgements specific to a note, are included in the note to which they relate. Furthermore, the section details
      new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, that the Group has adopted in the current financial year or
      will adopt in subsequent years.

      (a) Basis of preparation
      The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International
      Accounting Standards in conformity with the applicable legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies
      applied are consistent with those of the preceding financial year, unless otherwise stated.

      The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. All financial information is presented in millions of pounds
      sterling (‘£’), which is the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest £0.1m, unless otherwise stated. The financial
      statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of particular financial
      instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.

      (b) Going concern
      The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the
      Strategic report.

      The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the available
      resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.

      The going concern assessment is based on the detailed forecast prepared by management and approved by the Board (base
      plan). As part of the going concern review, the Directors have considered severe, but plausible, downside scenarios to stress
      test the viability of the business. These downside scenarios covered reduction in revenues, profitability, cash position and
      liquidity as well as the Group’s ability to meet its regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Appropriate assumptions have
      been made in respect of revenue growth and profitability, based on the economic outlook over the forecast period. Appropriate
      sensitivities have been applied in order to stress test the base plan, considering situations with lower revenue growth and
      profitability compared to the base plan, where future trading is less than forecasted. Management expects that sufficient
      liquidity and regulatory capital requirement headroom are maintained throughout the forecast period.

      The Directors have made inquiries of management and considered forecasts for the Group and have, at the time of approving
      these financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operations for the
      foreseeable future. Further details are contained in the Viability Statement of the Strategic Report.

      (c) Basis of consolidation
      The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Wise plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2024.

      Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
      rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
      over the entity.

      Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and are de-consolidated from the
      date that control ceases.

      Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies within the Group are eliminated
      on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the
      transferred asset. Group accounting policies are consistently applied to all entities and transactions.
                                                                                                   Wise Annual Report and Accounts 2024   131




(d) Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current or non-current classification.

An asset is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

• expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;
• held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period;
• cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the
  reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

• it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;
• it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period;
• there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets
and liabilities.

(e) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Items included in the financial statements of
each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(‘the functional currency’).

Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates
at the date the transaction is recognised.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss (either as
cost of sales or administrative expenses).

Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates if held at historical cost, or year-end exchange
rates if held at fair value, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in either the income statement or
shareholders’ equity depending on the treatment of the gain or loss on the asset or liability.

Group companies
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy) are translated into pounds sterling as follows:

• assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;
• income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

(f) Changes in material accounting policies and disclosures
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the Group from 1 April 2023:

a. Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies

Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting
policy information disclosed in the financial statements. The amendments require the disclosure of ‘material’, rather than
‘significant’, accounting policies. Management reviewed the accounting policies and made updates to the information disclosed
in the Annual Report in line with the amendments.

b. Amendments to IAS 12 – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The Group
has applied a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up taxes and accounts
for it as a current tax when it is incurred. The Group has performed an initial assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two
income taxes. This assessment is based on the most recent information available regarding the financial performance of the
constituent entities in the Group. Based on the initial assessment performed, the Group does not expect any material top-up
taxes. The Group is continuing to monitor potential future implications.
132    Financial Statements      Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued



      c. Other amendments:

      • IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts
      • Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Policies
      • Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

      The adoption of the other amendments did not have a material impact on the Group. There are no other new or revised
      standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 April 2023 that would
      be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

      New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
      The following amendments have been published by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
      2024; the amendments have not been early-adopted by the Group:

      a. Amendment to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants

      The amendments, as issued in 2020, aim to clarify the requirements on determining whether a liability is current or non-current,
      and apply retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. It is anticipated that the application
      of those amendments may have an impact in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in future periods.

      b. New standard issue – IFRS 18 Primary financial statements

      The new standard will become effective, in the consolidated Group financial statements, for annual reporting periods beginning
      on or after 1 January 2027 and its impact is under assessment.

      c. Other amendments:

      • Amendments to IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
      • Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier Finance Arrangements
      • Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeability
      • Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale of Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

      None of the other amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or
      on foreseeable future transactions.

      1.3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
      Details of critical judgements which the Directors consider could have a significant impact on these financial statements are set
      out in the following notes:

      • Customer balances (recognition of the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the balance sheet) – note 15 and note 16
      • Net gains and losses from foreign exchange differences (accounting) – note 6

      Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of estimation.


      Note 2. Segment information

          Accounting policy
          The Group is managed on the basis of a single segment. The information regularly reported to the Chief Operating
          Decision Maker (‘CODM’), which is currently the Board of Directors of the Group, for the purposes of resource allocation
          and the assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. Based on the Group’s
          business model, the Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is provision of
          cross-border and domestic financial services.




      The Group’s revenue, assets and liabilities for the reportable segment can be determined by reference to the statement of
      comprehensive income and the statement of financial position. The analysis of revenue by type of customer and geographical
      region is set out in note 3.
                                                                                                Wise Annual Report and Accounts 2024   133



At the end of each reporting period, the majority of the non-current assets were carried by Wise Payments Limited in the UK.
Based on the location of the non-current asset, the following geographical breakdown of non-current assets is prepared:

Note 3. Revenue

     Accounting policy
     The Group primarily generates revenue from money transfers, conversion services and debit card services.

     A customer enters into the contract with the Group at the time of opening a Wise Account or initiating a money transfer.
     The customer agrees to the contractual terms by formally accepting the terms and conditions of the respective
     service, on Wise’s website or the App. For debit card services, a customer enters into the contract with the Group at
     the time the card, either virtual or physical, is made available for use and the customer is able to either make a
     payment or a withdrawal.

     The fees charged to customers for Wise’s services are shown to them upfront prior to a transaction, or conversion
     being initiated. The applicable fees depend on a number of factors, including the currency route, the transaction size,
     the type of transaction being undertaken and the payment method used. The fees for card transactions are in
     accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.

     The revenue is recognised at the point in time the performance obligation has been satisfied. For money transfers, the
     revenue is recognised upon delivery of funds to the recipient and for money conversions, when a customer balance is
     converted into a different currency in their account. For cards, the revenue is recognised upon transaction capture,
     unless it relates to the provision or replacement of physical cards, in which case the revenue is recognised over time
     throughout the period the debit card services are provided.

     The time required for the Group to process the payment to the recipient and, therefore, to satisfy its performance
     obligations, largely depends on the processing time its banking partners require to deliver funds to the recipient. As
     such the revenue is deferred until the funds are delivered. Transactions in certain jurisdictions, where the Group has
     settlement accounts with Central Banks, transfers between Wise accounts or conversions within a Wise Account, are
     generally fulfilled instantly.

     Rebates
     Wise offers certain rebates in the form of a fee refund or cashback for eligible revenue generating transactions. The
     rebate is recognised as a liability at the time of completion of the eligible transaction and is deducted from revenue.

     Other – Assets revenue
     The Group also generates revenue from its multi-currency investment feature, Wise Assets (‘Assets’). This feature
     allows customers to purchase units in investment funds, provided by fund managers, using their Wise account balance.
     The Group generates revenue from charging a fee based on the value of the assets under custody. The revenue is
     accrued on a daily basis and is recognised over time, in line with the period the Group provides its services to Assets
     customers. The Group acts as a matched principal broker and does not retain control nor benefits from the Assets, thus
     it does not recognise the financial assets and the respective liabilities for the Assets, and derecognises customer funds
     on purchase.

      The revenue split by customer type, personal or business, represents the underlying users of Wise products. Wise Account and
      standalone money transfers are attributed to personal, Wise Business to business, and Wise Platform is attributed to either,
      based on the ultimate customers of the partner that Wise is contracted with.

Note 6. Cost of sales and net credit losses on financial assets

    Accounting policy
    Cost of sales comprises the costs that are directly associated with the Group’s principal revenue stream of money
    transfer, conversion services and debit card services. This includes:

    • banking and other fees, net of applicable rebates, incurred in processing customer transfers and the costs of
      providing cards to customers;
    • net foreign exchange costs generated due to customer transactions. Within the same line are included the net
      foreign exchange differences from the revaluation of customer balances at period end. Other product costs include
      product losses that are directly generated from consumer transactions, including chargeback losses, as well as taxes
      directly attributable to customer activity.

    Critical accounting judgement
    Net gains and losses from foreign exchange differences
    Management applied judgement in classifying net foreign exchange gains and losses from customer transactions,
    including the costs related to the difference between the published mid-market rate offered to customers and the rate
    obtained by the Group in acquiring currency, as cost of sales. The Group considers these costs as directly related to
    and incurred as part of providing services to customers.

Note 9. Finance expense

     Accounting policy
     Interest expense related to the revolving credit facility is recognised in finance expense over the term of the facility
     using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate represents the true cost of borrowing and is the rate
     that discounts the estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the revolving credit facility.

Note 10. Tax

     Accounting policy
     The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to
     the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is
     also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

     The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
     date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management
     periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is
     subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to
     the tax authorities.

     Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
     carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have
     been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
     tax asset is realised, or the deferred tax liability is settled.

     Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
     against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets on share-based payments are
     recognised for the share options not exercised at the balance sheet date. The deferred tax assets on share-based
     payments are determined based on the share price at the balance sheet date. The impact of recognition is split
     between income tax expense in profit or loss for the year, for the element up to the cumulative remuneration expense;
     and the share-based payment reserve, recognised directly in equity, for the element in excess of the related
     cumulative remuneration expense.

     The impact of the recognition of deferred tax assets on losses is split between the share-based payment reserve, for
     the element of the tax deduction on exercise in excess of the related cumulative remuneration expense, and the
     income tax expense in profit or loss for the balance of the loss.

     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
     current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
     authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances
     on a net basis.

      The Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) before other comprehensive income (OCI) is a 26% charge (2023: 22% charge).

      This equates to the applicable UK corporation tax rate of 25%, adjusted for a number of factors such as non-deductible
      employee option plans, movements in provisions and higher overseas tax rates. The prior year ETR can be explained by the
      same key factors, but was lower for the year ended 31 March 2023 as the applicable UK corporate tax rate was 19%.

      The deferred tax asset in relation to share-based payments was recognised based on the share price at the balance sheet date
      which was £9.29 (2023: £5.40).

The deferred tax asset is predominantly generated in the UK and US and mainly comprises unexercised share options which are
forecast to be exercised within four years and as such are less sensitive to changes in long-term profit forecasts.

The deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine recoverability and to determine a reasonable time
frame for utilisation. To determine this, the Group uses the approved Group forecast used for the Viability Statement and going
concern analysis. The Group considers it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the coming years to realise the
deferred tax asset. Consequently, the Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of £nil (2023: £nil), with the
net deferred tax asset being recognised in full as at 31 March 2023 and 2024.

Both the UK and the US utilised brought forward losses in FY2023 and in FY2024, with the UK taxable losses fully utilised as at
31 March 2024. Therefore, there are no deferred tax assets in respect of losses recognised in the UK as at 31 March 2024. The
Group expects deferred tax assets of £30.1m to unwind within 12 months which will predominantly relate to exercised share
options in the UK and US. The deferred tax asset on share options will also be impacted by the future share price.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit
Shifting published on 20 December 2021 the Pillar Two model rules designed to address the tax challenges arising from the
digitalisation of the global economy.The Group operates in the United Kingdom (amongst other locations), which has enacted or
substantively enacted new legislation to implement the global minimum top-up taxes by 31 March 2024. The earliest period for
which substantively enacted legislation is effective for the Group is the year ended 31 March 2025, therefore there is no current
tax impact of Pillar Two income taxes for the year ended 31 March 2024. The Group has performed an assessment of the
Group’s potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. This assessment is based on the most recent information available
regarding the financial performance of the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment performed, the Group
does not expect any material top-up taxes. The Group is continuing to monitor potential future implications.

      Note 11. Earnings per share
      Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted
      average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, after deducting shares held by the Employee Share
      Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust.

      Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic
      calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares. For the purposes of diluted earnings per share it is
      assumed that any performance conditions attached to the schemes have been met at the balance sheet date.

      Note 12. Property, plant and equipment

           Accounting policy
           Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
           impairment losses. Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic
           benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.

           Computer equipment is not recorded in property, plant and equipment, but expensed as low-value, short-lived
           equipment in the Group.

           The accounting policy for right-of-use assets is included in note 17.

           Depreciation
           Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available for use, so as to allocate the cost of
           assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives assigned to principal
           categories of assets are as follows:

           • Right-of-use assets: lease term (1-7 years)
           • Leased office improvements: shorter of 5 years or lease term
           • Office equipment: 2 years

           Impairment of property, plant and equipment
           Reviews are carried out if there is an indication that assets may be impaired, to ensure that property, plant and
           equipment are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.

Note 13. Intangible assets

       Accounting policy
       Intangible assets predominantly relate to internally generated software and other intangible assets and are stated at
       cost less accumulated amortisation.

       Internally generated software
       The Group develops software used in the provisioning of its services. Only the development costs that are
       directly attributable to the design, development and testing of the software controlled by the Group are capitalised.
       Other development expenditures that do not meet the recognition criteria under IAS 38 are recognised as an
       expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset
       in a subsequent period.

       Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Directly attributable
       costs that are capitalised as part of the software product comprise software development employee costs.

       Other intangible assets
       Other intangible assets primarily include licences and domain purchases. They are amortised on a straight-line basis
       over their useful economic life or the term of the contract.

       Amortisation
       The Group amortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for mobile applications which are
       amortised over 2 years and licence purchases that are amortised over a period of 2-10 years.

       Impairment of intangible assets
       Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indicator that they might be impaired, for example
       when the assets are no longer in use and need to be decommissioned.

      In addition to the capitalised amounts as software, the Group expensed £115.8m of product engineering costs for the year
      ended 31 March 2024 (2023: £91.8m). These costs directly relate to the development of the Group’s product offerings and
      primarily comprise employee costs of the engineering and product teams that do not meet the capitalisation criteria.

      During the year, the Group removed from the asset register intangible assets with a total cost of £19.7m (2023: £15.3m), that
      have been fully amortised.




             Accounting policy
             Trade and other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from payment processors, partners, customers and
             collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparts. Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair
             value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairment for expected credit losses. The carrying values of
             current trade receivables approximate their fair values due to their short maturity.

             The Group recognises impairment loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets that are
             measured at amortised cost. The Group’s receivables are considered to qualify for the simplified approach, which
             requires expected lifetime credit losses to be recognised from the initial recognition of the receivables.

             Refer to note 18 for further information on expected credit losses.

             The impairment loss allowance recognised during the year relates to chargebacks and negative customer balances. For
             chargebacks, the Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
             adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. For negative customer
             balances, if an active non-fraudulent account goes more than 30 days past due, according to the Group policy, it is
             perceived as an indication of a significant increase in credit risk and the receivable is provided in full.

1. Receivables from customers are net of expected credit loss provision of £41.3m as at 31 March 2024 (2023: £31.5m). The movement in the year
   is predominantly related to increased activity and the related increase in customer balances, which resulted in the increase of negative
   customers’ balances older than 30 days. Customer chargebacks decreased by £1.6m to £2.5m at 31 March 2024 (31 March 2023: £4.1m) and
   overdrawn accounts increased by £11.5m to £38.9m (31 March 2023: £27.4m).



Note 15. Cash and cash equivalents

     Accounting policy
     Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, on-demand deposits, term deposits used for meeting short-term
     cash commitments, money market funds (MMFs) and other short-term high-quality liquid investments with original
     maturities of 3 months or less, and e-money held with payment processing partners. Due to the short duration of the
     cash and cash equivalents (less than 3 months), the fair value approximates the carrying value at each reporting
     period. As the Government bonds which we hold have original maturities of greater than 3 months they are regarded as
     Short Term Investments, rather than cash and cash equivalents, see Note 18 for further detail.

     Cash in transit to customers represents cash that has been paid out from the Group bank accounts, but has not been
     delivered to the bank account of the beneficiary.

     Cash collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties are recognised under ‘Trade and other receivables’ in
     the statement of financial position.

     Customer deposits
     As disclosed above, the Group recognises financial assets and liabilities for the funds customers hold in their Wise
     accounts and the funds collected from customers, as part of the money transfer settlement process, that have not yet
     been processed. The liability is recognised upon receipt of cash or capture confirmation (depending on pay-in method),
     and is derecognised when cash is delivered to the beneficiary.

     Principles to determine the point of delivery are the same as applied in revenue recognition; refer to note 3.

     Critical accounting judgements
     Customer balances
     The Group recognises financial assets and corresponding liabilities for the funds customers hold in their Wise accounts
     and the funds the Group receives as part of the money transfer settlement process. At the point that the cash is
     received from the customer, the Group becomes party to a contract and has a right and an ability to control the
     economic benefit from the cash flows associated with this balance. Additionally, pursuant to IAS 32, the Group
     considers it does not have a legally enforceable right to set off these financial assets and liabilities, or an intention to
     settle them on a net basis or settle them simultaneously. Therefore, Management has concluded that the recognition of
     the financial assets and their respective liabilities on the balance sheet is appropriate.

      Cash at banks, in hand and in transit between Group bank accounts include term deposits of £285.8m (2023: £nil). Their
      settlement date is three months or less.

      Of the £10,479.2m (2023: £7,679.4m) cash and cash equivalents at the year end, £1,061.1m (2023: £671.1m) is the corporate
      cash balance of the Group. This balance is not related to customer funds, which are held in Wise accounts, or collected from
      customers as part of the money transfer settlement process.

      The Group is subject to various regulatory safeguarding compliance requirements with respect to customer funds. Such
      requirements may vary across the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates. As at 31 March 2024, the Group held
      £5,290.5m (2023: £3,832.9m) of customer funds as cash in segregated, safeguarding bank accounts at investment grade
      banking institutions and term deposits. The remainder of safeguarded customer deposits were held across highly liquid global
      money market funds (MMFs), treasury bonds and investment grade corporate paper, as allowed by local regulations.



      Note 16. Trade and other payables

          Accounting policy
          Accounts payable consist of obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course
          of business from suppliers on the basis of normal credit terms and do not bear interest.

          Wise Accounts relate to the funds customers hold in their Wise accounts and the funds the Group receives as part of
          the money transfer settlement process. They are non-derivative liabilities to individuals or business customers for
          money they hold with the Group and do not constitute borrowings. Refer to note 15 for details of the judgement
          Management has exercised in relation to customers’ balances and the recognition of the financial assets and their
          respective liabilities on the balance sheet.

          Outstanding money transmission liabilities represent transfers that have not yet been paid out or delivered to a recipient.

          Payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

          Trade and other payables are unsecured unless otherwise indicated; due to the short-term nature of current payables,
          their carrying values approximate their fair value.

Note 17. Borrowings

      Accounting policy
      Revolving credit facility (RCF)
      The RCF is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and is subsequently carried at amortised
      cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as
      interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the borrowing. Fees paid on the establishment of
      loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the
      facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred and treated as a transaction cost when the draw-down
      occurs. The Group presents the impact of transaction costs as part of financing cash flows.

      The Group uses the facility primarily for short-term funding, as such the facility has been recorded as a current liability
      on the balance sheet.

      Leases
      Where the Group is the lessee, the right-of-use of assets are recorded within the ‘Property, plant and equipment’ line in the
      statement of financial position and are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability. They are related to office spaces
      leased in various locations and depreciated on a straight-line basis with the charge recognised in administrative expenses.
      The liability, recognised as part of borrowings, is measured at a discounted value and any interest is charged to finance
      charges. The Group presents the payments of principal and interest on lease liabilities as part of financing cash flows.

      The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases (leases with a lease term of
      12 months or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Low-value assets comprise IT and office
      equipment with a purchase price under £5,000. Payments associated with short-term and low-value assets are
      recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

      Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group and
      they are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group initially assesses at lease commencement
      whether it is reasonably certain it will exercise the options and subsequently reassesses if there is a significant event or
      significant changes in circumstances within its control. The Group has concluded it is not reasonably certain that the
      options will be exercised.

      Revolving credit facility (RCF)
      The Group has access to a multi-currency revolving facility offered by a syndicate of eight lenders, namely: HSBC Innovation
      Banking Limited, National Westminster Bank Plc, Citibank N.A., London Branch, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch,
      Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, Barclays Bank Plc, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., and The Governor and Company
      of the Bank of Ireland. In December 2023, the Group exercised an accordion feature within the agreement to increase the total
      available committed funding capacity by an additional £100.0m, increasing the total facility size from £300.0m to £400.0m. The
      maturity date of the facility is in August 2025, and the agreement offers two one-year, extension options.

      The facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to SONIA plus a margin determined by reference to adjusted leverage
      (calculated as a ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA). The agreement contains certain customary covenants, including to maintain a
      maximum total net leverage ratio not in excess of 3:1 and interest cover (calculated as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to finance
      charges in accordance with the terms of the agreement) not less than a ratio of 4:1 in respect of any relevant period.

      The Group monitors compliance with the covenants throughout the reporting period and has complied with all financial
      covenants for this and all reporting periods. The undrawn available committed funds as at 31 March 2024 was £200.0m
      (2023: £50.0m).

      The facility is secured by certain customary security interests and pledges including over shares in certain Group entities (Wise
      plc, Wise Financial Holdings Ltd, Wise Payments Limited, Wise US Inc., Wise Europe SA and Wise Australia Pty Ltd), and fixed
      and floating pledges over assets and undertakings of Wise Payments Limited, excluding customer and partner funds, share
      capital or equity contributions maintained for regulatory purposes, cash paid into a bank or collateral account in connection with,
      and for the benefit of, relevant card scheme providers and assets held in safeguarded accounts or otherwise segregated for
      regulatory purposes.

      Lease liabilities
      As at 31 March 2024, the lease liabilities are £21.5m (2023: £14.5m) and relate to the expected terms remaining on UK, US,
      Estonia, Hungary, Singapore, Belgium and Brazil office space leases discounted at between 2.21% and 15.75%. The leases expire
      between 2024-2030.

      The total expense, relating to short-term leases to which the lessee recognition and measurement requirement have not been
      applied, for the year ended 31 March 2024 is £1.0m (2023: £1.4m).

      The Group has extension options in office leases, which has not been exercised as at 31 March 2024. The potential future lease
      payments, should the Group exercise the extension options, would result in an increase in the lease liability of £3.6m.

      The Group has a termination option in an office lease, which has not been exercised as at 31 March 2024. The potential future
      lease payments, should the Group exercise the termination option, would result in a decrease in the lease liability of £0.5m.

Note 18. Financial instruments and risk management

  Accounting policy
  Financial assets
  The Group classifies its financial assets, at initial recognition, and subsequently measures them at:

  • amortised cost;
  • fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and
  • fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

  The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flows and
  the Group’s business model for managing them. The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to
  how they are used in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from
  collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Cash flows in relation to purchase or sale of
  these instruments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.

  Financial assets at amortised cost
  The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

  • the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and
  • the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

  Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject
  to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or
  impaired. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly trade and other receivables and cash
  and cash equivalents.

  Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
  The Group classifies debt securities (e.g. bonds) as FVOCI, as the contractual cash flows are solely payments of
  principal and interest, and the objective of the Group’s business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash
  flows and selling financial assets.

  Financial assets through profit or loss (FVTPL)
  Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at
  amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets through profit or loss include
  derivative assets.

  Impairment of financial assets
  The Group recognises impairment loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets that are
  measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The ECL assessment considers both
  the 12-month ECL and the lifetime ECL, as per IFRS 9 requirements.

  For debt instruments held at FVOCI, collateral deposits the Group holds with its counterparties and receivables from
  payment processors, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. The Group’s policy only allows exposures to
  financial institutions with sound credit quality rating and limits the exposure to a maximum amount. Furthermore, as per
  Group’s investment policy, the debt instruments held at FVOCI consist solely of quoted bonds that are graded in the
  top investment categories (rated A- and above) and, therefore, are considered to be low credit risk investments.

  ECLs on such instruments are measured on a 12-month basis; nevertheless, when there has been a significant increase
  in credit risk since initial recognition, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. At every reporting date, the
  Group evaluates whether or not these financial instruments are considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable
  and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. The Group uses external credit ratings if
  available both to determine whether the financial instrument has significantly increased in credit risk and to estimate
  ECLs. If a bank or other financial institution has no external credit rating, the Group evaluates its credit quality, where
  necessary, by analysing its financial position, past experience, and other factors.

          Impairment of financial assets continued
          The Group’s remaining trade and other receivables qualify for the simplified approach in calculating ECLs, as they do
          not contain a significant financing component. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead
          recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. To measure the ECLs, trade receivables
          have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The Group’s expected credit
          loss policy is to reassess all trade receivables over 30 days past due, and provide an ECL allowance if the balance is
          deemed to be at risk.

          In calculating the ECL on the receivable recognised for chargebacks, the Group has established a provision matrix that
          is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the
          economic environment. For negative customer balances, if an active non-fraudulent account goes more than 30 days
          past due, according to the Group policy, it is perceived as an indication of a significant increase in credit risk and the
          receivable is provided in full.

          While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, no impairments were
          required to be recognised on these financial assets as they are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

          Financial liabilities
          Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for the derivative liabilities, which are classified as financial
          liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.

          Derivative financial instruments
          Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used
          by the Group are foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forwards and non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards.
          Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is
          entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting date. The Group
          does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

          The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined by mark-to-market valuation technique. The key
          inputs in the valuation model are the observable foreign exchange rates for the currencies involved. These inputs are
          considered level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as they are observable, but may not be quoted directly for the
          specific instruments.




      In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to the main financial risks: liquidity, credit and market risk from its use of
      financial instruments. The Group’s financial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the
      Group’s financial performance.

      a. Liquidity risk
      Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Management monitors rolling
      forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.

      The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it always has enough liquid resources to meet its liabilities
      when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s position above
      the Group’s liquidity risk appetite. The Group utilises an internal liquidity adequacy assessment process to assess the Group’s
      liquid resources; this process includes an assessment of net stressed liquidity outflows over a number of severe yet plausible
      stress scenarios. This ensures the Group maintains prudent levels of liquid resources at all times to meet both regulatory and the
      internal liquidity risk requirements.

      The Group assessed the concentration risk associated with refinancing its debt and concluded that it is low. This conclusion is
      based on the diverse mix of available liquidity sources available to Wise alongside robust internal cash reserves. The Group has
      not experienced any difficulties in sourcing additional liquidity over the past twelve months.

      The breakdowns of trade payables and borrowings into current and non-current are shown in notes 16 and 17. See also note 18
      (e) for the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted cashflows.

      b. Credit risk
      Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
      contractual obligations. The credit risk exposure is managed at Group level against the Group’s credit risk appetite. Wise actively
      manages credit concentration risk and it is Wise’s policy to impose credit limits in order to control the exposure (amount and
      period) Wise has with each counterparty considering their level of risk. These limits are set based on the credit rating or
      perceived credit quality of each counterparty and approval must be obtained from the Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO).

c. Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from floating interest rate borrowings (refer to note 17) and manages the potential that
financial expenses increase when interest rates increase. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the interest rate risk.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from fixed rate interest rate assets and liabilities on Wise’s balance sheet. The main
fixed interest rate exposure for Wise is driven by the safeguarded assets (mainly sovereign bonds) held as part of the
investment portfolio. The interest rate risk is measured and monitored through an interest rate stress (175 basis points move in
interest rates) applied on the bond assets, with an impact of £38.4m across all bond holdings.

Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate movement from holding assets and liabilities in different currencies and
guaranteeing customers a foreign exchange rate on their international transfers for a short period of time. Wise actively monitors
foreign exchange risk, and exposures are managed through a combination of natural hedging and treasury products hedging.

      1. The Group mitigates the exposure to foreign exchange risk from movements in these currencies with a combination of treasury products. For
         further information on the instruments the Group utilises to manage its foreign exchange risk, refer to the ’Foreign exchange risk’ section above.

      The Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange fluctuations by currency is as follows:
      A 5% strengthening or weakening of GBP against all other currencies, with all other variables being constant, would result in a
      foreign exchange loss or gain of £1.6m (2023: £1.7m), excluding the tax effect. The Group considers a 5% strengthening or
      weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change in
      foreign exchange rates.
                                                                                                   Wise Annual Report and Accounts 2024   151




d. Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities
and to meet its regulatory capital requirements, both under normal operating environments and stressed conditions.

The Group’s capital comprises ordinary share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital risk are to:

• safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that the Group can continue to provide returns for
  shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;
• maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital;
• adhere to regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction; and
• fund an orderly wind-down in an adverse reverse scenario.

Further information on the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital, along with the disclosure requirements under
MIFIDPRU 8, can be found on our Owner relations website: https://wise.com/owners/.

The Group is subject to prudential regulatory consolidation which follows the rules in the sourcebook for MIFID investment firms
(‘MIFIDPRU’). This is the case due to the existence of TINV Ltd, a group UK FCA-regulated investment firm subject to the same
rules.

Both TINV Ltd (MIFID investment firm) and the Group (MIFID investment group) are classified as Non-small and Non-
interconnected investment firms (‘non-SNI’).

Overall own funds requirement
The Group own funds requirement is subject to the variable own funds requirement that is the highest of:

1. its permanent minimum capital requirement (i.e. its initial capital requirement);
2. its fixed overheads requirement (FOR); and
3. its K-factor requirement (KFR).

The Group also follows and adheres to the Overall Own Funds Threshold Requirement as this is derived by the Group’s Internal
Capital Adequacy Assessment (ICARA) and approved by the Board. ICARA is a continuous risk assessment process which
considers the business model implication on capital and liquidity on an ongoing basis pursuant to the guidance of MIFIDPRU 7.

      Fair value hierarchy
      Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to
      the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.

      • Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the
        reporting period. Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise treasury bonds and investment grade corporate paper.
        The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current close price at the balance sheet date.
      • Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques
        with the inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. The Group classifies foreign exchange contracts as level 2
        financial instruments. These instruments are valued by observable foreign exchange rates. There were no changes to the
        valuation technique during the period.
      • Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
        The Group does not currently have any financial instruments in level 3.

      Note 20. Own share reserve

              Accounting policy
              Own share reserve
              Own share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares of Wise plc that are held by the employee share
              trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share plans. Own shares are treated as a
              deduction from equity and, on exercising of employee awards, are transferred from own shares to retained earnings at
              their weighted average cost.

              Employee share trust
              The Group provides financing to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either purchase the Company’s
              shares on the open market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital, to meet the Group’s obligation to provide
              shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the
              consolidated income statement. The Group consolidates this share trust.
              Shares held by the ESOP Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares until such time that
              employees exercise their awards. The consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of
              income taxes), on purchase of Company’s equity instruments is deducted from equity.




      Purchase of own shares
      During the financial year, Wise continued the programme, which commenced in 2023, to purchase Wise shares in the market,
      through the Trust, in order to reduce the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. As of 31 March 2024, a total of
      9,071,706 shares were purchased from the market at an average of £7.56 per share. Directly attributable costs of £0.5m have
      been charged to equity.

Note 21. Share-based employee compensation

    Accounting policy
    The Group operates a number of employee equity-settled schemes as part of its reward strategy, which are designed
    to provide long-term incentives for all employees to deliver long-term shareholder returns. Under the plans,
    participants are granted share awards of the Company, which vest gradually over the vesting period and are equity
    settled for shares within Wise plc.

    The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted and it is calculated
    using the closing share price at the grant date. It is recognised in employee benefit expenses together with a
    corresponding increase in equity (share-based payment reserve), over the period in which the service and the
    performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). Upon exercise of share options, the impact is recognised in
    retained earnings.

    For non-market-based awards, vesting conditions are included in the assumptions of the number of options and
    awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options and
    awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the statement
    of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve. For awards subject
    to a market-based performance condition, no subsequent adjustments may be made.

    Employee share award plans
    The awards are subject to service conditions, i.e. the requirement for recipients of awards to remain in employment
    with the Group over the vesting period, which typically is 4 years.

    For the market-based award
    For the market-based award, the vesting is conditional on achievement of the relative total shareholder return (TSR)
    compared to the FTSE 250 and volume growth performance measures over the 3-year performance period.



Transactions on the share award plans during the year were as follows:

      In preparing these financial statements, the Company has taken advantage of certain exemptions permitted by FRS 102, as the
      equivalent disclosures are made in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

      Exemptions have been applied in respect of the following disclosures:

      • The cash flow statement and related notes
      • Share-based payments
      • Capital management disclosures
      • Certain related-party transactions including the remuneration of key management personnel
      • Financial instrument disclosures
      • A reconciliation of shares outstanding at the beginning and end of the period

      The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.

      The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
      It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies.

      The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company are included in the note to which they relate. These policies have
      been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

      Dividends
      The Group has not declared or paid out any dividends for the year ended 31 March 2024 (no dividend was declared or paid for
      the year ended 31 March 2023).

      Key sources of estimation uncertainty
      The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires that management make certain estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in
      the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best estimates at the date of the financial
      statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the
      period in which the circumstances change.

      Management has concluded that there are no critical accounting areas of judgement and estimation.


      Note 2. Dividend income
      The Company received dividend income from subsidiary undertakings totalling £28.0m (2023: no dividend income from
      subsidiary undertakings during the year).

Note 3. Investments in subsidiaries

    Accounting policy
    Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value.

    The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan for the employees of subsidiary undertakings
    using the Company’s equity instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of this share-based
    compensation plan is recognised as a capital contribution to the Company’s subsidiary undertakings over the vesting
    period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiary undertakings in respect of these
    share-based payments.

    Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
    The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.

    If any indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
    amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be
    impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and
    loss account.



The Company holds a direct investment in Wise Financial Holdings Ltd. In addition, during the year to 31 March 2024, the
Company recognised a capital contribution of £71.8m (2023: £55.2m), representing the service costs for the employees of its
subsidiaries, under the Company’s share option schemes, and a respective reduction in the capital contribution of £44.0m
(2023: £nil) for the payments received during the financial year from subsidiary undertakings in respect of those service costs.

A full breakdown of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiary undertakings is provided in note 7.

The movement in the subsidiary undertakings during the financial year to 31 March 2024 is provided below:

                                                                                                                 2024           2023

      Note 6. Own share reserve

              Accounting policy
              Own share reserve
              Own share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares of Wise plc that are held by employee share trust
              for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share plans. Own shares are treated as a
              deduction from equity and, on exercising of employee awards, are transferred from own shares to retained earnings at
              their weighted average cost.

              Employee share trust
              The Group provides finance to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust to either purchase the Company’s
              shares on the open market, or to subscribe for newly issued share capital, to meet the Group’s obligation to provide
              shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trust are charged to the
              consolidated income statement. The Company consolidates this share trust.
              Shares held by the ESOP Trust are deducted from reserves and presented in equity as own shares until such time that
              employees exercise their awards. The consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of
              income taxes), on purchase of Company’s equity instruments is deducted from equity.




      Purchase of own shares
      During the financial year, Wise continued the programme, which commenced in 2023, to purchase Wise shares in the market
      through the Employee Benefit Trust in order to reduce the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. As of 31 March
      2024, a total of 9,071,706 shares were purchased from the market at an average of £7.56 per share. Directly attributable costs
      of £0.5m have been charged to equity.

Alternative performance
measures
The Group uses a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”) within its financial reporting. These measures are not
defined under the requirements of IFRS and may not be comparable with the APMs of other companies.

The Group believes these APMs provide stakeholders with additional useful information in providing alternative interpretations
of the underlying performance of the business and how it is managed and they are used by the Directors and management for
performance analysis and reporting. These APMs should be viewed as supplemental to, but not a substitute for, measures
presented in the financial statements which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Underlying interest income    The first 1% yield of interest income on customer balances that Wise plans to retain
Income                        Income is calculated as revenue plus interest income on customer balances, less
                              interest expense on customer balances and benefits paid relating to customer
                              balances
Underlying income             The measure of income that will be retained from customers, which is calculated
                              as revenue plus ’Underlying Interest Income’
Underlying operating profit   The calculation of underlying operating profit using ‘underlying income’ and
                              excluding the Benefits paid relating to customer balances
Underlying profit before      Measure of profitability which is calculated as profit for the year, excluding the      See definition for
tax                           impact of interest income from customer balances above the first 1% yield and           calculation
                              benefits paid relating to customer balances. The Group believes that Underlying         method
                              profit before tax is a useful measure for investors as it provides a measure of
                              underlying performance and growth that is not inflated by the excess interest
                              income that we will look to pass back to our customers

Adjusted EBITDA               Measure of profitability which is calculated as profit for the year excluding the       See definition for
                              impact of income taxes, finance income and expense, depreciation and amortisation,      calculation
                              share-based payment compensation expense as well as exceptional items.                  method
                              At the time of our listing in 2021, stock-based compensation was satisfied through
                              the issuance of new shares and we therefore elected to remove this non-cash
                              expense from our chosen lead metric for earnings (‘Adjusted EBITDA’). Our strong
                              cash generation and capital position has allowed us to initiate a programme of
                              purchasing Wise shares through our Employee Benefit Trust to reduce the dilutive
                              impact of stock-based compensation. Therefore the Adjusted EBITDA measure of
                              earnings has, in our view, become less useful in understanding the performance of
                              the underlying business and as a result our reporting going forward will focus to a
                              greater extent on ‘underlying profit before tax’ and its representation as a margin
                              of underlying income.
Adjusted EBITDA margin        Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of income
Underlying adjusted           Measure of profitability which takes ’Adjusted EBITDA’ and adjusts the calculation
EBITDA                        to remove the excess Interest Income on Customer Balances above the amount
                              of ’Underlying Interest Income’ and also removes benefits paid relating to
                              customer balances.

                              activities less the change in working capital (excluding timing differences for         flow APM for
