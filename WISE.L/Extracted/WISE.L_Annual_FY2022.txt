Strategic report
for the year ended
31 March 2020.
Moving the world’s money,
without borders.
                 TransferWise is a global technology company that’s building the
                 best way to move money around the world.


                 Whether you’re sending money to another country, spending
                 money abroad, or making and receiving international payments
                 for your business, TransferWise is on a mission to make your life
                 easier and save you money.


                 More than 7 million people and businesses have stopped using
                 banks and traditional exchange services because TransferWise
                 is cheaper, faster and easier to use. Large companies and banks
                 use TransferWise technology too; an entirely new cross-border
                 payment network that can one day power money without
                 borders for everyone, everywhere.


                 TransferWise’s product suite includes the borderless account
                 and debit card, its money transfer service, and its Application
                 Programming Interface (API) for larger enterprises and
                 bank partnerships.

Mission and   TransferWise was founded in 2011 with one mission - to build money
              without borders: instant, convenient, transparent and eventually free.
              Our co-founders Kristo and Taavet wanted to stop the global practice




progress.
              of banks and brokers charging extortionate hidden fees, resulting in
              expensive, slow international payments. This mission is the northstar
              that guides our product and all our decisions. It’s what makes
              TransferWise so unique.




              Nine years on, it’s still early in our journey, but we’re making
              real progress.

The financial year 2020 has been a year of truly global growth.
We’ve expanded our worldwide footprint, and taken our product
portfolio far beyond the transparent, cheap, fast and convenient
money transfers that we’re known for.

We’re revolutionising international banking with our borderless
account, and today hold over £1.97 billion in customer accounts.
TransferWise is also providing a greater range of features
in response to customer demand. Financial year 2020 saw us
bring the borderless account and debit card to the US, Australia,
New Zealand and Singapore. 7 million people have now
left banks and traditional providers to find a better
way with TransferWise.

              Code of conduct.

              Our Code of Conduct helps guide all our employees
              about what is expected of those working at TransferWise,
              and how we care about them. It’s made up of 3 important
              pillars - how we look after each other, our customers and
              TransferWise overall. We strongly believe in empowering
              our employees to speak out about anything that makes
              them feel uncomfortable, so that they know how
              to raise any issues in a safe and confidential way.


              Taking care of the environment.

              Our response to the climate crisis is emission zero.


              In the same way that we are working to drop our prices
              to their theoretical minimum - as close to zero as possible
              - we are beginning a similar journey with our carbon
              emissions: emission zero.


              In Q1 2020 we made a commitment to be carbon neutral
              from 2020 onwards. This is a significant step and one
              that we believe all business should strive to take.


              We will initially achieve neutrality via an offsetting program.

Our approach to risk
                management.

              We understand how crucial it is to have an appropriate
              risk management and control environment to support
              our mission. Our business model exposes us to many
              risks, and we work together to ensure that our process
              of managing those risks is core to our ways of working.

              We have a risk management framework that lays out
              key policies and procedures, sets clear risk appetite
              statements and provides a toolkit for our people to
              use in their day to day. We operate a Three Lines of
              Defence model and report to our Board throughout the
              year about our risk profile and the effectiveness of risk
              management.
