Q1 FY25 Trading Update
16 July 2024


          Customer growth continues to drive volume and underlying income growth

    ●    26% YoY growth in quarterly active customers to 8.4m, driven by strong customer
         retention and new customers joining as a result of recommendations.
    ●    Volumes increased 18% YoY (20% on a constant currency basis) to £33.2bn, driven by the
         continued growth in active customers, while we reduced fees with the cross border take
         rate reducing c.5% to 64 bps YoY (down from 67 bps in Q4 FY24).
    ●    Underlying income grew 22% YoY to £325.4m, with continuing growth in deposit balances
         (23% YoY) and strong card and other revenue growth (55% YoY).
    ●    Continuing to expect strong growth in FY25 with underlying income expected to grow
         15-20% over FY24.
    ●    Focus remains on the long term opportunity to grow cross border volumes while targeting
         an underlying profit before tax margin of 13-16%.


We’re pleased to start the new financial year on a positive note, with strong momentum in active
customer and volume growth. We remain committed to offering the lowest possible price for moving
and managing money internationally, a key pillar of our mission and a significant driver of business
growth. In Q1, we reduced fees for customers with our cross border take rate at 64 bps in Q1 FY25,
c5% lower fees on average compared to last quarter. This reduction was made possible through our
efforts to improve efficiency and represents another investment into our long term growth.


This quarter, we were thrilled to announce our first Wise Platform partnership in Brazil with Nubank,
one of the world’s largest digital banking platforms. Meanwhile, our partnership with Qonto in Europe
is simplifying international payments for over 500,000 SMEs and freelancers.
