Q4 FY25 Trading Update
15 April 2025


           28% cross-border volume growth as Wise progresses towards moving trillions

       ●    We are progressing on our vision to become the network for the world’s money, as
            quarterly cross-border volumes grew 28% YoY to £39.1bn and Wise customer holdings
            grew by 33% to £21.5bn
       ●    9.3m active customers used Wise in Q4, representing active customer growth of 17% YoY
       ●    The cross-border take rate reduced by 3bps to 53bps, reflecting an increase in the
            proportion of higher volume customers in the period
       ●    Underlying income was £350.4m in Q4 FY25, growing 15% YoY on a constant currency
            basis, and 13% YoY on a reported basis due to the previously flagged FX headwind
       ●    For FY25, growth in active customers, up 21% to 15.6m, combined with the greater
            adoption of Wise account features, drove a 23% increase in cross-border volume to
            £145.2bn1 and underlying income growth of 16% to £1.36bn on a reported basis. On a
            constant currency basis, underlying income grew 18% to £1.39bn for the year
       ●    Our FY25 preliminary underlying PBT margin was c.20% and for FY26, we continue to
            expect this to be around the top of our 13-16% target range.


“We ended the financial year taking Wise to even more people and businesses around the world. We
launched Wise in Mexico, allowing Mexicans to be able to send money to the rest of the world with
Wise. It’s exciting that we now benefit from two-way flows with Mexico. In Hong Kong, we rolled out
the Wise Business account, enabling businesses to get paid globally. And in Latin America, we
announced a new Wise Platform partnership with Itaú Unibanco, one of the region’s largest banks,
enabling instant cross-border payments directly from the Itaú app.


We continue to move closer towards achieving money without borders by investing in our long-term
growth: we recently launched our popular Interest feature in Australia, helping more customers earn
returns by placing their money in funds backed by government-guaranteed assets. We also
announced the opening of a new hub in Hyderabad to drive growth in India, building on recent office
expansions in London, Tallinn and Singapore.”
