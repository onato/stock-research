Note: We define a monthly active user as an authenticated Pinterest user who visits our website, opens our mobile application or interacts with Pinterest through one of our browser or site
extensions, such as the Save button, at least once during the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. The number of MAUs do not include Shuffles users unless they would otherwise
qualify as MAUs. We present MAUs based on the number of MAUs measured on the last day of the current period. Geographic breakdown may not sum to Global due to rounding.

Note: We measure monetization of our platform through our average revenue per user metric. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a period divided by
average MAUs in that geography during the period. We calculate average MAUs based on the average of the number of MAUs measured on the last day of the current period and the last
day prior to the beginning of the current period. We calculate ARPU by geography based on our estimate of the geography in which revenue-generating activities occur.

Note: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, interest income
(expense), net, other income (expense), net, and provision for (benefit from) income taxes, restructuring charges, and non-cash charitable contributions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA
by revenue. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the tables included in the Appendix at the end of this release.
