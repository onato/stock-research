          With this strategy, we stay true to our brand, while

         Josh Rushby, Head of Content, Swoon




         Using the Pinterest Trends tool, home decor brand Swoon noticed substantial growth on
         searches for terms related to green living areas. Coupled with the 2022 Pinterest Predicts
         data that spotted biophilic design as an emerging trend, they created a campaign dubbed
         Green Living. This campaign encouraged people to increase their connection with nature by
         investing in some of Swoon’s distinctive designs in shades of green. Swoon’s campaign
         resulted in full funnel results, with a 48% increase in ROAS year over year, and a 25% lift in
         conversion rates compared to other platforms.

            Note: We measure monetization of our platform through our average revenue per user metric. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a period divided by
          average MAUs in that geography during the period. We calculate average MAUs based on the average of the number of MAUs measured on the last day of the current period and the last
                  day prior to the beginning of the current period. We calculate ARPU by geography based on our estimate of the geography in which revenue-generating activities occur.
