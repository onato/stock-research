“ People come to Pinterest to dream up
  and plan their next holiday. With Travel
  Catalogs, we were able to make our
  ads more actionable and saw a strong
  increase in users clicking through to view
  available hotel listings,”
 Miriam Abels
 Digital Performance Marketing,
 TUI Germany


 TUI, one of the world's leading tourism groups, knows that people come
 to Pinterest to get inspired and plan holidays. By adding Travel Catalogs
 to their full funnel approach, TUI was able to promote their large variety
 of hotel listings, and make their ads more actionable by allowing users to
 easily click through to them.

 The results for TUI were strong, leading to 6x higher outbound
 clickthrough rate (oCTR) and a 80% lower outbound-cost-per-click
 (oCPC) than they were seeing in previous conversion campaigns.

                We’re growing our inspired engagement
Q223 Business   • We grew our global user base year over year to 465M MAUs.

Highlights
                • Engagement metrics like sessions, impressions, and saves grew faster than MAUs, indicating we’re
                  deepening our engagement with our user base.
                • Global Mobile app MAUs grew 16% year over year, and our U.S. and Canada mobile app MAUs
                  grew 9% year over year.
                • Gen Z users continue to grow on Pinterest. In Q2, Gen Z were our largest contributor to overall
                  engagement growth and the fastest growing cohort, growing double digits and accounting for a
                  larger portion of our overall mix.
                • In H1, we incorporated propensity to share into our AI recommender models, improving retention of
                  our core users, and growing revisits of dormant users.
                • We launched a browsing module to help users find new use cases on the platform, leading to a
                  meaningful lift in revisitations.
                • We saw strong growth in the number of MAUs engaging with emerging verticals such as men’s
                  fashion, autos, health and travel in the first half of this year.
                We’re expanding our advertiser solutions
                • We launched travel catalogs this quarter, allowing advertisers to reach users who are in the midst
                  of planning, organizing, and taking action on their travel dreams.
                • We’ve steadily grown the percentage of revenue from large advertisers who adopted our
                  conversion API solution.
                • In July, we brought our mobile deep linking product, or MDL, to general availability.
                • We made our Premier Spotlight ad format available for all advertisers, and we are seeing early
                  adoption from a large number of brand advertisers.
                • We expanded our use of GPU serving from core engagement AI models to our ads delivery models,
                  which enabled us to use models that were 100x larger than before in ads as well as organic. The
                  cumulative impact was a 5% reduction in cost-per-action and over 10% lift in click-through rates.

                We’re building an inspired shopping experience
Q223 Business   • Users are actively engaging with shoppable content, with click-through rates and saves of

Highlights
                  shoppable pins growing over 50% year over year, accelerating from Q1.
                • We launched a new, automated “shop the look” module for home decor and fashion pins that
                  utilizes AI to recommend similar shoppable products tied to our merchant catalogs. In early
                  tests, this drove a 9% increase in conversions.
                • Shopping ads revenue continued to grow at a pace meaningfully faster than our overall
                  revenue rate.
                We’re doubling down on what makes us different
                • We published our latest Transparency Report, covering the second half of 2022. Our biannual
                  transparency report features more than 400 distinct data points on our content moderation
                  and enforcement practices as we continue to evolve our approach to keep up with new trends.
                • We announced our support of the Inspired Internet Pledge, which is a call to action for tech
                  companies and the broader digital ecosystem to unite with the common goal of making the
                  internet a safer and healthier place.
                • We’re building inclusive AI technology like skin tone diversification that helps users personalize
                  their experience and see themselves on Pinterest. In Q2 we improved the skin tone
                  diversification of our core feeds, which led to engagement wins.

            Note: We measure monetization of our platform through our average revenue per user metric. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a period divided by
          average MAUs in that geography during the period. We calculate average MAUs based on the average of the number of MAUs measured on the last day of the current period and the last
                  day prior to the beginning of the current period. We calculate ARPU by geography based on our estimate of the geography in which revenue-generating activities occur.
