  I can think of. If I want a recipe, it’s my
  cookbook. If I want a new outfit for a job
  interview, it’s my fashion magazine. And
  even for shopping, I can look for things I
  may want, and then click, and buy the item.
  It’s a big collection of anything I could need.”

Kohl’s     “ We know people are coming to Pinterest
             with shopping intent and an inspirational
             mindset, creating the perfect environment
             to create fun and innovative experiences
             that really resonate with shoppers,”
                Christie Raymond, Kohl’s Chief Marketing Officer

                Shoppers are turning to Pinterest as a key shopping destination: a place to get
                inspired and discover new ideas. With fall fashion in full force, and the holiday
                season right around the corner, Kohl’s tapped Pinterest’s shopability and trends to
                help consumers find what they’re looking for in more fun and inspiring ways. Kohl’s
                launched the Trend Matchmaker experience, leaning into recent key trends on
                Pinterest like “Power Casual,” to allow consumers to “swipe-right” on clothes that
                match their personal style. Kohl’s also launched the Outfit Color Match interactive
                quiz to help consumers find, and then shop, for outfits with a specific color theme
                that fits them best. The results speak for themselves, with the engagement rate on
                this experience outpacing Pinterest benchmarks by over 200%*.
