          to reach users who are early in the
          purchase journey, enabling us to
          capture interest and encourage users
          to be potential Mazda owners”

         Mazda Canada




         Advertisers in emerging verticals are turning to Pinterest to harness the unique
         commercial intent that our users express on our platform. Automotive
         company Mazda teamed up with Pinterest to generate buzz for their new CX-
         90 SUV. To maximize campaign impact, Mazda centered the campaign around
         users who have specifically engaged with content in the automotive category.
         The campaign was a success for Mazda, measuring a 45% lower cost-per-click
         and a 3.5x higher click-through-rate as compared to benchmark.

Highlights        engagement with our user base.

                • Gen Z was the fastest growing demographic on the platform, and grew double digits year over year.

                We’re improving our inspired content offering

                  quarter.
                • Our corpus of images continues to grow, even off a very large base, and we saw that the number of
                  boards grew double digits in Q1.
                • We expanded our GA launch of Shuffles to nine additional countries, including Germany, France,
                  Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands.
                • We launched a partnership with Dotdash Meredith to bring hundreds of original videos to the
                  platform, timed with annual moments ranging from wedding season to the holidays.
                • We expanded our Creator Inclusion Fund to five new countries: Canada, Germany, Austria,
                  Switzerland, and France.
                • We partnered with American stylist and author Stacy London, who hosted a series of fireside chats
                  exclusively on Pinterest TV around female wellness, joined by a number of notable female-founders
                  of wellness and consumer products in the space.

                We’re expanding our advertiser solutions
Q123 Business   • We began testing Premiere Spotlight, our first premium awareness offering to showcase brands in
                  an exclusive placement on our search page for 24 hours.
Highlights      • In Q1, we integrated our API for conversion with Tealium, and we are in the process of onboarding
                  advertisers like Wayfair onto our LiveRamp clean room solution in Q2.
                • We introduced our latest edition of Pinterest Academy, a compelling interactive e-learning
                  platform covering everything advertisers need to know to engage and inspire their target
                  audiences on the platform.
                • Whole page optimization continued to drive more relevant ad impressions. As a result, our ads
                  marketplace is getting more efficient, contributing to an 8% reduction in CPAs for performance
                  advertisers.
                • Shopping ads revenue, driven by our mobile deep linking product, grew over 40% year over year.

                We’re doubling down on what makes us different
                • As the positive corner of the Internet, we are deeply committed to protecting the wellbeing of our
                  users. In late March, we made it mandatory for users to provide their birth dates, so that we can
                  provide age-appropriate features and functionality. Pinterest is now private by default for existing
                  and new users under the age of 16, and their content and profiles won’t be discoverable by others.
                • Several third party studies have shown that users feel safer on Pinterest than other platforms, and
                  they feel more positive when on Pinterest.
                • We announced our 2022 Inclusion & Diversity report, under the theme “Inspiring Action.” This

                  initiatives and milestones over the last two years that demonstrate how Pinterest is working to be a
                  positive force for good across our business and within communities.

            Note: We measure monetization of our platform through our average revenue per user metric. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a period divided by
          average MAUs in that geography during the period. We calculate average MAUs based on the average of the number of MAUs measured on the last day of the current period and the last
                  day prior to the beginning of the current period. We calculate ARPU by geography based on our estimate of the geography in which revenue-generating activities occur.
