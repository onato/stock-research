(together with its subsidiaries, Square or the Company) creates tools that help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businesses. Square's point-of-sale service offers tools for every part of running a business, from accepting credit cards and tracking inventory, to real-time analytics and invoicing. Square also offers sellers financial and marketing services, including small business financing and customer engagement tools. Businesses and individuals can also use Square Cash, an easy way to send and receive money, as well as Caviar, a food delivery service for popular restaurants. Square was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia.Initial Public OfferingIn November 2015, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which it issued and sold 29,700,000shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $9.00per share and a selling stockholder sold 1,350,000shares of Class A common stock. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder. The total net proceeds received by the Company from the IPO were $245.7 millionafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $14.7 millionand other offering expenses of approximately $6.9 million.Basis of PresentationThe accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the applicable rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. TheDecember31, 2015, condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to state fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss,and cash flows for the interim periods. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The interim results for thethreemonths endedMarch31, 2016are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year endingDecember31, 2016, or for any other future annual or interim period. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Items 7, 7A, and 8, respectively, in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember31, 2015.Use of Estimates The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from the Companys estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Companys financial condition or operating results will be materially affected. The Company bases its estimates on past experience and other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and the Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis.Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, accrued transaction losses, provision for uncollectible receivables related to merchant cash advances (MCAs), business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and share-based compensation.8Concentration of Credit RiskFor the threemonths endedMarch31, 2016and 2015, the Company had no customer other than Starbucks that accounted for greater than 10%of total net revenue. The Company had threethird-party processors that represented approximately 48%, 34%, and 15%of settlements receivable as of March31, 2016. The same threeparties represented approximately 56%, 23%, and 16%of settlements receivable as of December31, 2015.The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities with large, creditworthy financial institutions. Balances in these accounts may exceed federally insured limits at times.Significant Accounting PoliciesThere have been no material changes to the Companys significant accounting policies during thethreemonths endedMarch31, 2016, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products. This guidance specifies how prepaid stored-value product liabilities should be derecognized, thereby eliminating the current and potential future diversity in practice. This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations, which provides implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. This guidance clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e., the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements.This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.NOTE 2- RESTRICTED CASHAs of both March31, 2016andDecember31, 2015, restricted cash of $13.5 millionis related to pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process the Company's sellers' payment transactions.The Company uses the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with the financial institutions to provide collateral for cash flow timing differences in the processing of these payments. The Company has recorded this amount as a current asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted. As of March31, 2016andDecember31, 2015, the remaining restricted cash of $15.0 millionand $14.7 million, respectively, is primarily related to cash deposited into money market funds that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements entered into in 2012and 2014(see note 17). The Company has recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets as the terms of the related leases extend beyond one year. 9NOTE 3- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe Company measures its cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments at fair value. The Company classifies its cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments within Level1 or Level2 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company values these investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. The Companys financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are classified as follows (in thousands):March31, 2016December31, 2015Level 1Level 2Level 3Level 1Level 2Level 3Cash and Cash Equivalents:Money market funds$224,602$$$337,234$$U.S. agency securities2,500Commercial paper5,346Municipal securities1,672Short-term securities:U.S. agency securities8,484Corporate bonds4,543Commercial paper20,430U.S. government securities9,990Long-term securities:U.S. agency securities7,662Corporate bonds5,908U.S. government securities16,145Total$250,737$56,545$$337,234$$The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, settlements receivable, merchant cash advance receivable, accounts payable, customers payable, settlements payable, and debt, approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. During the threemonths ended March31, 2016and 2015, the Company did not have any transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets or liabilities.NOTE 4- INVESTMENTSThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as available-for-sale.10The Company's short-term and long-term investments as ofMarch31, 2016are as follows (in thousands):Amortized CostGross Unrealized GainsGross Unrealized LossesFair ValueShort-term securities:U.S. agency securities$8,479$5$$8,484Corporate bonds4,5435(5)4,543Commercial paper20,43020,430U.S. government securities9,98559,990Total$43,437$15$(5)$43,447Long-term securities:U.S. agency securities$7,641$21$$7,662Corporate bonds5,90175,908U.S. government securities16,1073816,145Total$29,649$66$$29,715For the threemonths ended March31, 2016, gains or losses realized on the sale of investments were insignificant. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairments. As the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments with unrealized losses until a recovery of fair value, or for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at March31, 2016.The contractual maturities of the Company's short-term and long-term investments as ofMarch31, 2016,are as follows (in thousands):Amortized CostFair ValueDue in one year or less$43,437$43,447Due in one to five years29,64929,715Total$73,086$73,162NOTE 5- MERCHANT CASH ADVANCE RECEIVABLE, NETThe Company enters into purchase and sale transactions with pre-qualified sellers in which the Company purchases a designated amount of future receivables for an upfront cash purchase price. The delivery of the future receivables purchased in exchange for the advance cash purchase price is facilitated through the merchants payment processing activities with the Company. There is no economic recourse to the seller in the event that the future receivables are not generated. There is also no fixed period of time in which the seller must deliver the purchased future receivables to the Company, as delivery of the purchased future receivables is contingent on the sellers generation of such receivables. The Company has limited contractual remedies in the event that a seller breaches its agreement with the Company (e.g., where a seller does not use the Company as its exclusive processor while future receivables purchased by the Company remain outstanding). Although there is no economic recourse to the seller in the event that the future receivables are not generated, the degree of uncertainty related to this economic benefit is mitigated by the extensive due diligence performed by the Company prior to purchasing the sellers future receivables and is further mitigated by limited contractual remedies. The Companys due diligence includes, but is not limited to, detailed analyses of the sellers historical processing volumes, transaction count, chargebacks, growth, and account longevity.The Company is exposed to losses related to uncollectible receivables purchased by the Company other than receivables that are sold to third parties in accordance with the Companys arrangements with these third parties.11The Company establishes reserves for uncollectible receivables based on historical trends, adverse economic conditions, and specific merchant activity. Subsequent delivery to the Company of a previously designated uncollectible receivable is reflected as a reduction in the allowance for uncollectible receivables when the delivery of the receivable occurs. The following table summarizes the activities of the Companys allowance for uncollectible receivables (in thousands):Three Months Ended March 31,20162015Allowance for uncollectible receivables, beginning of the period$7,443$2,431Provision for uncollectible receivables732,504Receivables charged off(58)Allowance for uncollectible receivables, end of the period$7,458$4,935The table above includes a reduction in uncollectible receivables for the threemonths ended March31, 2016, primarily as a result of an update to the Company's provision estimates for Square Capital, which the Company continues to refine as more historical data becomes available.

As of March31, 2016and December31, 2015, goodwill was $56.7 million. 12The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually on December 31 and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For the periods presented, the Company had recorded noimpairment charges.

Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at the Companys option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00%to 1.00%or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00%to 2.00%. This margin is determined based on the Companys total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. The Company is obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an annual administrative agent fee of $0.1 millionand an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. To date no funds have been drawn under the credit facility, with $375.0 millionremaining available. The Company paid $0.1 millionin unused commitment fees during the threemonths ended March31, 2016. NOTE 12- ACCRUED TRANSACTION LOSSESThe Company is exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility. Recoveries are reflected as a reduction in the reserve for transaction losses when the recovery occurs.15The following table summarizes the activities of the Companys reserve for transaction losses (in thousands):Three Months Ended March 31,20162015Accrued transaction losses, beginning of the period$17,176$8,452Provision for transaction losses7,18213,757Charge-offs and recoveries to accrued transaction losses(8,939)(5,398)Accrued transaction losses, end of the period$15,419$16,811NOTE 13- INCOME TAXESThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 millionfor the threemonths ended March31, 2016, compared to income tax expense of $0.4 millionfor the threemonths ended March31, 2015. The Companys effective tax rate was approximately (0.4)%for the threemonths ended March31, 2016, compared to an effective tax rate of (0.9)%for the threemonths ended March31, 2015. The Companys effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business.As of March31, 2016, the Company retains a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The realization of the Companys deferred tax assets depends primarily on its ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable in future periods may change as management continues to reassess the underlying factors it uses in estimating future taxable income. The income tax expense recorded for the threemonths ended March31, 2016, was primarily due to state and foreign income tax expense. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for the threemonths ended March31, 2016, primarily relates to the valuation allowance on the Companys deferred tax assets. The tax provision for the threemonths ended March31, 2016, was calculated on a jurisdiction basis. We estimated the foreign income tax provision using the effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. NOTE 14- STOCKHOLDERS EQUITYCommon StockThe Company has authorized the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted.

The 2015 Plan serves as the successor to the 2009 Plan. The 2015 Plan became effective as of November 17, 2015. Outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2009 Plan.Under the 2015 Plan, shares of common stock are reserved for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. The shares may be granted at a price per share not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. Initially, 30,000,000shares were reserved under the 2015 Plan and any shares subject to options or other similar awardsgranted under the2009 Planthat expire, are forfeited, are repurchased by theCompany or otherwise terminate unexercised will become available under the2015 Plan. The number of shares available for issuanceunder the2015Planwill be increased on the first day of each fiscalyear, in an amount equal to the least of (i) 40,000,000shares, (ii) 5%of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (iii) such number of shares determined by the Companys board of directors.As of March31, 2016, the total number of shares subject to stock options and RSUs outstanding under the2015Planwas 8,395,459,and 42,414,446shares were available for future issuance.As of March31, 2016, the total number of shares subject to stock options and RSUs outstanding under the2009 Planwas 101,516,657.

In the event of a termination, the modified expiration date will be the earlier of (i)threeyears from termination or (ii)oneyear following an initial public offering, if in each case, the date of termination occurs between August31, 2015 and the nine-month anniversary of the initial public offering. In all cases, the grants remain subject to earlier expiration in accordance with their original terms. During the threemonths endedMarch31, 2016, share-based compensation expense included $0.7 millionrelated to the vested portion of the impacted options, as a result of the modification. The Company will incur an additional $7.4 millionof share-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods of the impacted options.The fair value of stock options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:Three Months Ended March 31,20162015Dividend yield%%Risk-free interest rate1.39%1.63%Expected volatility43%54%Expected term (years)6.086.15The following table summarizes the effects of share-based compensation on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Three Months Ended March 31,20162015Product development$21,947$8,958Sales and marketing2,9031,429General and administrative6,3483,074Total$31,198$13,461OnNovember17, 2015, the Companys 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) became effective.

Notably, the Company is currently involved in ongoing legal proceedings with Robert E. Morley and REM Holdings 3, LLC (REM). In tworelated proceedings, the Company is litigating disputes over certain patents and over Mr.Morleys early involvement in the business enterprise that became Square.On December1, 2010, the Company, along with its co-founder Jim McKelvey, filed a complaint (2010 Complaint) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (District Court), which, as amended, concerns the inventorship, ownership, implied license, non-infringement, invalidity, and unenforceability of threepatents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,918,394 (394 Patent), 7,810,729 (729 Patent), and 7,896,248 (248 Patent). All threepatents are in a single patent family directed to card reader technology. The patents, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) granted in 2010 and 2011, name Mr.Morley as the sole inventor and REM as their assignee of rights. The 2010 Complaint sought to add Mr.McKelvey as a named inventor of those patents given his significant contributions to the claimed inventions. REM counterclaimed, alleging infringement by Square of the threepatents, and the Company subsequently requested that the PTO reexamine those patents.On January17, 2012, the PTO issued a reexamination certificate invalidating the entirety of the 394 Patent. With the 394 Patent invalidated, twopatents remained for consideration by the PTO: the 729 Patent and the 248 Patent. In April 2012, the PTO reexamination examiner closed prosecution on those twopatents, rejecting all of the claims of the 729 Patent and 13of the 20claims of the 248 Patent as invalid in view of prior art. REM appealed the reexamination examiners rejections on these tworemaining patents to the Patent Office Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB), and the Company appealed to have the PTAB reject the remaining sevenclaims of the 248 Patent and to recognize additional grounds for rejection of the previously rejected 248 Patent and 729 Patent claims. In March 2014, the PTAB issued a decision in the Company's favor, affirming the rejection of all claims of the 729 Patent, affirming the rejection of the 13claims of the 248 Patent, and ruling that the reexamination examiner should also reject the remaining sevenclaims of the 248 Patent (having so ruled, the PTAB did not need to consider 20additional grounds for rejecting the 248and 729 Patent claims). Following the PTABs ruling, REM filed a response on the 248 Patent, substantially amending (i.e., adding new limitations to) fiveof the sevenclaims the PTAB had found to be unpatentable. On June5, 2015, the PTO reexamination examiner, having considered the newly amended claims on remand, issued a preliminary determination that the new limitations allowed those fivedependent claims to overcome the grounds for the PTABs rejection ruling. The PTO reexamination examiner noted, however, that at least fourof the fivenew claims were still unpatentable because they were indefinite, impermissibly broad, or lacked support in the specification. Additionally, on September 8, 2015, REM filed a notice of appeal at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the PTABs decision regarding the 729 Patent. The Company's arguments with respect to the remaining claims of the 248 Patent at the PTAB and the appeal by REM with respect to the 729 Patent are still pending, and the Company intends to pursue them vigorously. With the exception of these fivemore recently amended claims, which have not yet progressed beyond preliminary reexamination examiner review, all of the claims from all threepatents asserted in the 2010 Complaint have either been canceled or otherwise found unpatentable by the PTAB.On January30, 2014, three weeks after the PTAB hearing that resulted in the rejection of all of Mr.Morleys and REMs remaining claims of the patents in the 2010 Complaint, Mr.Morley and REM filed a complaint against the Company and against Jack Dorsey and Mr.McKelvey, in the District Court, alleging that the formation of Square and the development of the Company's card reader and decoding technologies constituted, among other things, breach of an alleged joint venture, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of trade secrets, as well as other related claims (2014 Complaint). Mr. Morley contends as part of his alleged joint venture claim, among others, that he was an equal partner with Mr.Dorsey and Mr.McKelvey in the business enterprise that ultimately evolved into Square, and that Mr.Dorsey and Mr.McKelvey breached their alleged joint venture agreement with Mr.Morley by excluding him from ownership in Square. Mr.Morley claims that to the extent the defendants contend that no joint venture was formed, Mr.McKelvey and Mr.Dorsey committed fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and/or fraudulent nondisclosure. The 2014 Complaint also alleges infringement of another patent related to the 248, 394, and 729 Patents, U.S. Patent No.8,584,946 (946 Patent). Mr.Morley is seeking a judgment and order that Square, Mr.Dorsey, and Mr.McKelvey hold ownership of Square in constructive trust for Mr.Morley, as well as a variety of additional damages, injunctive relief, royalties, and correction of inventorship of certain of the Company's patents.Even prior to the filing of the 2014 Complaint, on December31, 2013, the Company had filed a petition at the PTAB requesting inter partes review (IPR) proceedings to invalidate the 946 Patent. On July 7, 2015, the PTAB issued a decision on the IPR, rejecting 12of the 17claims of the 946 patent, including all independent claims, to be invalid based on prior art.On November 20, 2015, the PTAB rejected twoadditional claims of the 946 patent in response to the Company's request for rehearing. Consequently, 14of the 17claims of the 946 patent stand rejected.On February 9, 2016, the Company filed an ex parte reexamination request at the patent office to invalidate the threeremaining claims of the 946 patent. On March 30, 2016,the patent officegranted the Company's requestand instituted reexaminationon all threeclaims.The Company moved to consolidate the 2014 Complaint with the 2010 Complaint (the Complaints), and the District Court granted the Company's motion on July16, 2014. The Company moved to dismiss certain claims as time barred under California and Delaware law, and the District Court denied the motion on October16, 2014, applying Missouri law. The Company moved to stay counts of the 2014 Complaint related to alleged infringement of the 946 Patent and inventorship of certain of its patents, pending the ongoing PTO proceedings, and on April2, 2015, the District Court granted the Company's motion to stay. The District Court has issued a scheduling order that sets forth the current expected schedule of important events in the proceedings, but no assurances can be given that the schedule will not change. A two-week trial is currently scheduled for June 13, 2016. The Company is vigorously defending against the Complaints. Notably, the Company filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on January 20, 2016. On April 22, 2016, the District Court denied the Company's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Company recently signed a binding term sheet with Mr. Morley and REM stipulating the material terms of a settlement. While the final definitive agreement has not yet been finalized, the Company recorded a charge of $50.0 millionin general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31, 2016. Until the Company enters into a final definitive agreement, the Company can make no assurances about the specific settlement terms, including monetary and nonmonetary terms.Additionally, the Company is involved in a class action lawsuit concerning independent contractors in connection with the Company's Caviar business. On March19, 2015, Jeffry Levin, on behalf of a putative nationwide class, filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Caviar, Inc., which, as amended, alleges that Caviar misclassified Mr.Levin and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors and, in doing so, violated 21various provisions of the California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code by requiring them to pay various business expenses that should have been borne by Caviar. Mr.Levin also sought an award of penalties pursuant to the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 on behalf of the putative class. On March 29, 2016, the Court entered a Notice of Intent to Dismiss the lawsuit, and on May 2, 2016, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety. The parties stipulated that certain dismissed claims may be pursued by a different courier, if plaintiff's counsel so chooses.In addition, from time to time, the Company is involved in various other litigation matters and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company believes that none of the Company's current legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.NOTE 18- SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATIONOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Companys CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the information set forth within the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember31, 2015. The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, and other non-historical statements in this discussion, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Overview We started Square in February 2009 to enable anyone with a mobile device to accept card payments, anywhere, anytime. While we found early success providing easy access to card payments, commerce extends beyond payments. In every transaction, we see opportunity for our sellers: to learn more about which products are selling best, to reinvest in their businesses, or to create and engage loyal buyers. Although we currently generate approximately 89%of our total net revenue from payment processing services, which include revenue generated from Starbucks, we have extended our product and service offerings to include additional software and data products, all to help sellers start, run, and grow their businesses.We work to democratize commerceleveling the playing field for sellers of all sizes. Our focus on technology and design allows us to create products and services that are accessible, intuitive, and easy-to-use. We set attractive and transparent pricing that is easy for our sellers to understand. We provide a free software app with our affordable (often free) hardware to turn mobile devices into powerful POS solutions in minutes. Our insights into our sellers businesses have allowed us to develop services that are applicable to businesses of all types and sizes, from Square Analytics to digital receipts. We continue to add advanced software features that tailor our POS solution to specific types of sellers, such as open tickets for bars and restaurants and inventory management for retailers. We also bring further capabilities to our sellers through Build with Square, a suite of developer tools that allows sellers to process online payments on their own self-hosted website, customize any iOS point-of-sale to process payments with Square, and track, manage, and grow both their online and offline businesses in a single dashboard.Because of our approach, we have grown rapidly. Millions of sellers accept payments with Square. They span all types of businesses: from cabs to coffee shops, lawyers to landscapers, retail stores to restaurants. Although substantially all of our revenue is currently generated in the United States, we also serve sellers throughout Canada, Japan and, as of the first quarter of 2016, Australia. As this international base of sellers grows, we expect our Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and revenue in these 23regions to grow as well. We serve sellers of all sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers market to multinational businesses. Our products and services are built to scale, so sellers can stay with us over the life of their businesses.The addition of new products and services is also a key part of our strategy. Our scale, growth, and unique insights enable us to serve sellers of all sizes with additional financial services and marketing services, further strengthening our business. For example, we expect sellers who grow sales as a result of deploying funds from Square Capital into their business will likely also process increased payment volume with us. We are also focused on evolving each of our services to best serve our sellers, as evidenced by Square Capital's recent expansion from offering merchant cash advances (MCAs) to offering merchant loans, which offer increased flexibility for sellers, and position the service for continued scalable growth.For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, we processed $10.3 billionof GPV, up 45%from the three months endedMarch31, 2015. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, our total net revenue grew to $379 million, up 51%from the three months endedMarch31, 2015. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, our Adjusted Revenue grew to $146 million, up 64%from the three months endedMarch31, 2015. We intend to continue to make investments that will serve sellers and buyers over the long term even if a return on these investments is not realized in the short term. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016and March31, 2015, we generated a net loss of $96.8 millionand $48.0 million, respectively.

This increase was attributable to growth in GPV processed of $3.2 billion, or 45%, to $10.3 billionfrom $7.1 billion. The majority of GPV growth was derived from new sellers added within the three months endedMarch31, 2016; a smaller portion was generated by GPV growth from the payment activity of existing sellers that were approved to transact with us on or prior to March31, 2015.Transaction revenue contributed 79%of total net revenue in the three months endedMarch31, 2016, compared to 84%in the three months endedMarch31, 2015.Starbucks transaction revenue for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $9.6 million, or 33%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. Starbucks transaction revenue contributed 10%of total net revenue in the three months endedMarch31, 2016, compared to 12%in the three months endedMarch31, 2015. Under our amended payment processing agreement effective October1, 2015, Starbucks agreed to pay increased processing rates to us for as long as it continues to process transactions with us. While Starbucks announced that it would transition to another payment processor prior to the expiration of the payment processing agreement in the third quarter of 2016, we continued to process a portion of Starbucks payments, generating transaction revenue at the newly increased rates.Software and data product revenue for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $15.8 million, or 197%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. The increase was driven by the launch and expansion of new products and services in 2015 and 2016, including instant deposits. During the three months endedMarch31, 2016, Square Capital and Caviar remained the largest contributors to software and data product revenue. Software and data product revenue contributed 6%of total net revenue in the three months endedMarch31, 2016, compared to 3%in the three months endedMarch31, 2015.Hardware revenue for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $14.0 million, or 634%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. The increase primarily reflects growth in shipments of our Square Reader for Europay, 24MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) chip cards and near field communication (NFC) following its launch in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also continued to generate increased sales of Square Stand and third-party peripherals. Hardware revenue contributed 4%of total net revenue in the three months endedMarch31, 2016, compared to 1%in the three months endedMarch31, 2015.Total Cost of Revenue (in thousands, except for percentages)Three Months EndedMarch 31,20162015$ Change% ChangeTransaction costs$194,276$132,107$62,16947%Starbucks transaction costs36,61036,211$3991%Software and data product costs9,0333,155$5,878186%Hardware costs26,7404,197$22,543537%Amortization of acquired technology2,370602$1,768294%Total cost of revenue$269,029$176,272$92,75753%Total cost of revenue for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $92.8 million, or 53%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. Transaction costs for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $62.2 million, or 47%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in GPV processed of $3.2 billion, or 45%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015.Starbucks transaction costs for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $0.4 million, or 1%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. As a result of Starbucks' agreement to pay us increased processing rates effective October1, 2015, growth in Starbucks transaction revenue outpaced growth in Starbucks transaction costs compared to the prior year period.Software and data product costs for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $5.9 million, or 186%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015, primarily reflecting increased costs associated with growth and expansion of Caviar. To a lesser extent we also incurred increased amortization costs related to the development of certain software and data products.Hardware costs for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $22.5 million, or 537%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. The increase primarily reflects growth in shipments of our Square Reader for EMV chip cards and NFC following its launch in the fourth quarter of 2015, and to a lesser extent, increased sales of Square Stand and third-party peripherals. Hardware costs associated with the production of Square Stand exceed the revenue we derive from sales of Square Stand. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, hardware costs grew more slowly than hardware revenue as a result of increased sales of third-party peripherals and the introduction of our Square Reader for EMV chip cards and NFC.Amortization of acquired technology for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $1.8 million, or 294%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. The increase was related to new technology assets obtained through acquisitions that occurred in 2015.25Operating Expenses (in thousands, except for percentages)Three Months EndedMarch 31,20162015$ Change% ChangeProduct development$64,592$39,545$25,04763%% of total net revenue17%16%Sales and marketing$38,496$36,181$2,3156%% of total net revenue10%14%General and administrative$96,107$28,119$67,988242%% of total net revenue25%11%Transaction and advance losses$7,861$16,322$(8,461)(52)%% of total net revenue2%7%Amortization of acquired customer assets$317$468$(151)(32)%% of total net revenue%%Total operating expenses$207,373$120,635$86,73872%Product development expenses for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $25.0 million, or 63%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in engineering, design, and product personnel in the period from March31, 2015to March31, 2016, and increased tooling costs associated with the development of our next generation hardware products. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, product development expenses included $21.9 millionof share-based compensation expense, representing a $13.0 millionincrease compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, product development expenses also included $3.1 millionof depreciation expense, representing a $0.3 millionincrease compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015.Sales and marketing expenses for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $2.3 million, or 6%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in the period from March31, 2015to March31, 2016, and increased costs associated with our Square Cash peer-to-peer transfer service. This increase was offset in part by a decrease of $2.4 million in paid marketing expenses primarily due to elevated TV advertising in the prior year period. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, sales and marketing expenses included $2.9 millionof share-based compensation expense, representing a $1.5 millionincrease compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015.General and administrative expenses for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, increased by $68.0 million, or 242%, compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015, due in large part to an increase in customer support, legal, compliance, and finance personnel in the period from March31, 2015to March31, 2016. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, general and administrative expenses included $50.0 millionof expense related to a litigation accrual, with no similar activity during the three months endedMarch31, 2015. This accrual represents an estimate of potential losses related to ongoing legal proceedings with Robert E. Morley. The balance of the increased expenses in the period was primarily due to increased third-party legal, finance, consulting and certain software license expenses. For the three months endedMarch31, 2016, general and administrative expenses included $6.3 millionof share-based compensation expense, representing a $3.3 millionincrease compared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015.Transaction and advance losses for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, decreased by $8.5 millioncompared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015. During the three months endedMarch31, 2015, we accrued an estimate of $5.7 million related to a fraud loss from a single seller, with no similar activity during the three months endedMarch31, 2016. The remaining decrease is primarily a result of an update to our provision estimates for Square Capital, which we continue to refine as more historical data becomes available. Amortization of acquired customer assets for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, decreased by $0.2 millioncompared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015, primarily as a result of certain customer assets reaching end of life.26Interest and Other Income and Expense, Net (in thousands, except for percentages)Three Months EndedMarch 31,20162015$ Change% ChangeInterest (income) and expense, net$69$414$(345)(83)%Other (income) and expense, net(786)796$(1,582)(199)%Interest (income) and expense, net, for the three months endedMarch31, 2016, decreased by $0.3 millioncompared to the three months endedMarch31, 2015, primarily driven by interest income earned on our recent investment in marketable securities offsetting most of our interest expense.

Key Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources, and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net (loss) income, and other results under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the following table sets forth key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business. Each of these metrics and measures excludes the effect of our payment processing agreement with Starbucks. We do not intend to renew our payment processing agreement with Starbucks when it expires in the third quarter of 2016, and we amended the agreement to eliminate the exclusivity provision in order to permit Starbucks to begin transitioning to another payment processor starting October1, 2015. Under the amendment, Starbucks also agreed to pay increased processing rates to us for as long as it continues to process transactions with us. Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor and will cease using our payment processing services altogether prior to the scheduled expiration of the agreement in the third quarter of 2016. As a result, we believe it is useful to exclude Starbucks activity to clearly show the impact Starbucks has had on our financial results historically, to provide insight into the impact of the expected termination of the Starbucks agreement on our revenues going forward, to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business, and to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of other payment processors. Our agreements with other sellers, including Starbucks following the amendment described above, generally provide both those sellers and us the unilateral right to terminate such agreements at any time, without fine or penalty. Furthermore, we generally do not enter into long-term contractual agreements with sellers.Three Months EndedMarch 31,20162015$ Change% Change(in thousands, except GPV)Gross Payment Volume (GPV) (in millions)$10,290$7,117$3,17445%Adjusted Revenue$146,155$89,213$56,94264%Adjusted EBITDA$(9,083)$(20,129)$11,046NM27Gross Payment Volume (GPV)We define GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. GPV excludes card payments processed for Starbucks. Additionally, GPV excludes activity related to our Square Cash peer-to-peer payments service.Adjusted RevenueAdjusted Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as our total net revenue less transaction costs, adjusted to eliminate the effect of activity under our payment processing agreement with Starbucks. As described above, Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor and will cease using our payment processing services altogether, and we believe that providing Adjusted Revenue metrics that exclude the impact of our agreement with Starbucks is useful to investors.We believe it is useful to exclude transaction costs from Adjusted Revenue as this is a primary metric used by management to measure our business performance, and it affords greater comparability to other payment processing companies. Substantially all of the transaction costs excluded from Adjusted Revenue are interchange fees set by payment card networks and are paid to card issuers, with the remainder of such transaction costs consisting of assessment fees paid to payment card networks, fees paid to third-party payment processors, and bank settlement fees. While some payment processors present their revenue in a similar fashion to us, others present their revenue net of transaction costs because they pass through these costs directly to their sellers. Under our standard pricing model, we do not pass through these costs directly to our sellers.Adjusted Revenue has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:Adjusted Revenue excludes transaction costs, which is our largest cost of revenue item; andother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Revenue differently from how we calculate this measure or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Revenue alongside other financial performance measures, including total net revenue and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of total net revenue to Adjusted Revenue for each of the periods indicated:Three Months EndedMarch 31,20162015$ Change% Change(in thousands)Total net revenue$379,269$250,557$128,71251%Less: Starbucks transaction revenue38,83829,2379,60133%Less: transaction costs194,276132,10762,16947%Adjusted Revenue$146,155$89,213$56,94264%Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net loss, adjusted to eliminate the effect of Starbucks transaction revenue, Starbucks transaction costs and a litigation accrual described in Note 17 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, before interest income and expense, provision or benefit for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation expense, other income and expense, the gain or loss on the sale of property and equipment and impairment of intangible assets. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.28We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expenses, from our Adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We exclude Starbucks transaction revenue and Starbucks transaction costs because Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor prior to the scheduled expiration of our payment processing agreement in the third quarter of 2016. We believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA metrics that exclude the impact of our agreement with Starbucks is useful to investors. We exclude the litigation accrual described in Note 17 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, gain or loss on the sale of property and equipment and impairment of intangible assets from Adjusted EBITDA because we do not believe that these items are reflective of our ongoing business operations. In addition, we believe it is useful to exclude interest income and expense, other income and expense, and provision or benefit from income taxes, as these items are not components of our core business operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or other capital commitments;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the effect of income taxes that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the effect of foreign currency exchange gains or losses which is included in other income and expense; andother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from how we calculate this measure or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.

As of March31, 2016, we had $443.8 millionof cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, which were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper and corporate bonds. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our investments in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. In November 2015, we completed our initial public offering in which we received total net proceeds of $245.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $14.7 million and other offering expenses of $6.9 million. Prior to our initial public offering, our principal source of liquidity was private sales of convertible preferred stock with total cash proceeds to us of $544.9 million. In addition, we have a revolving secured credit facility that matures in November 2020. To date, no funds have been drawn under the credit facility, with $375.0 millionremaining available. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. This margin is determined based on our total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. We are obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an annual administrative agent fee of $0.1 millionand an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. We paid $0.1 millionin unused commitment fees during the threemonths ended March31, 2016. We fund a majority of our MCAs from arrangements with third parties that commit to purchase the future receivables related to these advances. In addition to MCAs, we are expanding Square Capital further to offer new types of services, including merchant loans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, and debt financing arrangements. We cannot be assured that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.Short-term restricted cash of $13.5 millionas of March31, 2016, reflects pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process our sellers' payments transactions. We use the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with these financial institutions to provide collateral for liabilities arising from cash flow timing differences in the processing 30of these payments. We have recorded this amount as a current asset on our condensed consolidated balance sheets given the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted.Long-term restricted cash of $15.0 millionas of March31, 2016, reflects cash deposited into money market accounts that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements entered into in 2012and 2014for our office buildings. We have recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as the terms of the related leases extend beyond one year.We experience significant day-to-day fluctuations in our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable and customers payable and hence working capital. These fluctuations are primarily due to:Timing of period end.For periods that end on a weekend or a bank holiday our cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivable and customer payable amounts typically will be more than for periods ending on a weekday, as we settle to our sellers for payment processing activity on business days; andFluctuations in daily GPV.When daily GPV increases, our cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivable and customer payable amounts increase. Typically our cash, cash equivalents, settlement receivable and customer payable balances at period end represent one to four days of receivables and disbursements to be made in the subsequent period.Customer payable and settlement receivable balances typically move in tandem, as pay-out and pay-in largely occur on the same business day. However, customer payable balances will be greater in amount than settlement receivable due to the fact that a subset of funds are held due to unlinked bank accounts, risk holds and chargebacks. Holidays and day-of-week may also cause significant volatility in daily GPV amounts.Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, provisions for transaction losses, excess tax benefit from share based award activity, provision for uncollectible seller cash advances, deferred income taxes and impairment of intangible assets, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital.For the threemonths ended March31, 2016, cash used by operating activities was $15.5 million, as a result of a net loss of $96.8 million, offset by non-cash items consisting of share-based compensation of $31.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $9.1 million, and provision for transaction losses of $7.2 million. Additional uses of cash were from changes in operating assets and liabilities, including increases in settlements receivable of $46.5 million, other current assets of $13.3 million, and merchant cash advance receivables of $11.8 million, offset in part by increases in customers payable of $58.9 millionand accrued expenses of $55.8 million.For the threemonths ended March31, 2015, cash used by operating activities was $11.0 million, as a result of a net loss of $48.0 million, offset in part by non-cash items consisting of share-based compensation expense of $13.5 million, provision for transaction losses of $13.8 millionand depreciation and amortization of $5.5 million. Additional uses of cash were from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in settlements receivable of $34.0 million, offset by an increase in customers payable of $38.6 million.Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth, changes in restricted cash, and business acquisitions.For the threemonths ended March31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was $81.3 millionas a result of the purchase of marketable securities of $73.1 millionand the purchase of property and equipment of $7.5 million.For the threemonths ended March31, 2015, cash used in investing activities was $14.3 millionas a result of the purchase of property and equipment of $10.4 millionand business acquisitions of $3.8 million.Cash Flows from Financing Activities 31For the threemonths ended March31, 2016, cash used in financing activities was $4.9 millionas a result of payments in offering costs related to our initial public offering, offset in part by proceeds from the exercise of stock options.For the threemonths ended March31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 millionas a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.Contractual Obligations and Commitments There were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations except for scheduled payments from the ongoing business, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember31, 2015.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented.32Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year endedDecember31, 2015. Our critical accounting policies have not materially changed during thethreemonths endedMarch31, 2016.Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated future trends and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because these accounting policies require significant judgment, our actual results may differ materially from our estimates. We believe the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, accrued transaction losses, provision for uncollectible receivables related to MCAs, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and share-based compensation to have the greatest potential effect on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe have operations both within the United States and globally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below.Interest Rate SensitivityOur cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March31, 2016, were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper and corporate bonds. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of a majority of these instruments. Additionally, we have the ability and the intent to hold these instruments until maturity which further reduces our risk. Any future borrowings incurred under our credit facility would accrue interest at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence (as described above). A 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.Foreign Currency RiskMost of our revenue is earned in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our foreign operations are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial results.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable 33assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act (according to Rule 13(a)-15(e)) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.34Part IIOther InformationItem 1. Legal ProceedingsWe are currently a party to, and may in the future be involved in, various litigation matters (including intellectual property litigation), legal claims, and government investigations. Notably, we are currently involved in ongoing legal proceedings with Robert E. Morley and REM Holdings 3, LLC (REM). In tworelated proceedings, we are litigating disputes over certain patents and over Mr.Morleys early involvement in the business enterprise that became Square.On December1, 2010, we, along with our co-founder Jim McKelvey, filed a complaint (2010 Complaint) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (District Court), which, as amended, concerns the inventorship, ownership, implied license, non-infringement, invalidity, and unenforceability of threepatents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,918,394 (394 Patent), 7,810,729 (729 Patent), and 7,896,248 (248 Patent). All threepatents are in a single patent family directed to card reader technology. The patents, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) granted in 2010 and 2011, name Mr.Morley as the sole inventor and REM as their assignee of rights. The 2010 Complaint sought to add Mr.McKelvey as a named inventor of those patents given his significant contributions to the claimed inventions. REM counterclaimed, alleging infringement by Square of the threepatents, and we subsequently requested that the PTO reexamine those patents.On January17, 2012, the PTO issued a reexamination certificate invalidating the entirety of the 394 Patent. With the 394 Patent invalidated, twopatents remained for consideration by the PTO: the 729 Patent and the 248 Patent. In April 2012, the PTO reexamination examiner closed prosecution on those twopatents, rejecting all of the claims of the 729 Patent and 13of the 20claims of the 248 Patent as invalid in view of prior art. REM appealed the reexamination examiners rejections on these tworemaining patents to the Patent Office Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB), and we appealed to have the PTAB reject the remaining sevenclaims of the 248 Patent and to recognize additional grounds for rejection of the previously rejected 248 Patent and 729 Patent claims. In March 2014, the PTAB issued a decision in our favor, affirming the rejection of all claims of the 729 Patent, affirming the rejection of the 13claims of the 248 Patent, and ruling that the reexamination examiner should also reject the remaining sevenclaims of the 248 Patent (having so ruled, the PTAB did not need to consider additional grounds for rejecting the 248and 729 Patent claims). Following the PTABs ruling, REM filed a response on the 248 Patent, substantially amending (i.e., adding new limitations to) fiveof the sevenclaims the PTAB had found to be unpatentable. On June5, 2015, the PTO reexamination examiner, having considered the newly amended claims on remand, issued a preliminary determination that the new limitations allowed those fivedependent claims to overcome the grounds for the PTABs rejection ruling. The PTO reexamination examiner noted, however, that at least fourof the fivenew claims were still unpatentable because they were indefinite, impermissibly broad, or lacked support in the specification. Additionally, on September 8, 2015, REM filed a notice of appeal at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the PTABs decision regarding the 729 Patent. Our arguments with respect to the remaining claims of the 248 Patent at the PTAB and the appeal by REM with respect to the 729 Patent are still pending, and we intend to pursue them vigorously. With the exception of these fivemore recently amended claims, which have not yet progressed beyond preliminary reexamination examiner review, all of the claims from all threepatents asserted in the 2010 Complaint have either been canceled or otherwise found unpatentable by the PTAB.On January30, 2014, three weeks after the PTAB hearing that resulted in the rejection of all of Mr.Morleys and REMs remaining claims of the patents in the 2010 Complaint, Mr.Morley and REM filed a complaint against us and against Jack Dorsey and Mr.McKelvey, in the District Court, alleging that the formation of Square and the development of our card reader and decoding technologies constituted, among other things, breach of an alleged joint venture, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of trade secrets, as well as other related claims (2014 Complaint). Mr. Morley contends as part of his alleged joint venture claim, among others, that he was an equal partner with Mr.Dorsey and Mr.McKelvey in the business enterprise that ultimately evolved into Square, and that Mr.Dorsey and Mr.McKelvey breached their alleged joint venture agreement with Mr.Morley by excluding him from ownership in Square. Mr.Morley claims that to the extent the defendants contend that no joint venture was formed, Mr.McKelvey and Mr.Dorsey committed fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and/or fraudulent nondisclosure. The 2014 Complaint also alleges infringement of another patent related to the 248, 394, and 729 Patents, U.S. Patent No.8,584,946 (946 Patent). Mr.Morley is seeking a judgment and order that Square, Mr.Dorsey, and Mr.McKelvey hold ownership of Square in constructive trust for Mr.Morley, as well as a variety of additional damages, injunctive relief, royalties, and correction of inventorship of certain of our patents.Even prior to the filing of the 2014 Complaint, on December31, 2013, we had filed a petition at the PTAB requesting inter partes review (IPR) proceedings to invalidate the 946 Patent. On July 7, 2015, the PTAB issued a decision on the IPR, rejecting 12of the 17claims of the 946 patent, including all independent claims, to be invalid based on prior art.On November 20, 2015, the PTAB rejected twoadditional claims of the 946 patent in response to our request for rehearing. Consequently, 1435of the 17claims of the 946 patent stand rejected.On February 9, 2016, we filed an ex parte reexamination request at the patent office to invalidate the threeremaining claims of the 946 patent. On March 30, 2016,the patent officegranted our requestand instituted reexaminationon all three claims.We moved to consolidate the 2014 Complaint with the 2010 Complaint (the Complaints), and the District Court granted our motion on July16, 2014. We moved to dismiss certain claims as time barred under California and Delaware law, and the District Court denied the motion on October16, 2014, applying Missouri law. We moved to stay counts of the 2014 Complaint related to alleged infringement of the 946 Patent and inventorship of certain of our patents, pending the ongoing PTO proceedings, and on April2, 2015, the District Court granted our motion to stay. The District Court has issued a scheduling order that sets forth the current expected schedule of important events in the proceedings, but no assurances can be given that the schedule will not change. A two-week trial is currently scheduled for June 13, 2016. We are vigorously defending against the Complaints. Notably, we filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on January 20, 2016. On April 22, 2016, the District Court denied our Motion for Summary Judgment. We recently signed a binding term sheet with Mr. Morley and REM stipulating the material terms of a settlement. While the final definitive agreement has not yet been finalized, we have recorded a charge of $50.0 millionin general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31, 2016. Until we enter into a final definitive agreement, we can make no assurances about the specific settlement terms, including monetary and nonmonetary terms.Additionally, we are involved in a class action lawsuit concerning independent contractors in connection with our Caviar business. On March19, 2015, Jeffry Levin, on behalf of a putative nationwide class, filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against our wholly owned subsidiary, Caviar, Inc., which, as amended, alleges that Caviar misclassified Mr.Levin and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors and, in doing so, violated various provisions of the California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code by requiring them to pay various business expenses that should have been borne by Caviar. Mr.Levin also sought an award of penalties pursuant to the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 on behalf of the putative class. On March 29, 2016, the Court entered a Notice of Intent to Dismiss the lawsuit, and on May 2, 2016, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety. The parties stipulated that certain dismissed claims may be pursued by a different courier, if plaintiff's counsel so chooses. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other litigation matters and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, we believe that none of our current legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business.Item 1A.
