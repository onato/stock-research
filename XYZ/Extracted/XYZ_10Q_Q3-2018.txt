(together with its subsidiaries, Square or the Company) creates tools that help sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. Square enables sellers to accept card payments and also provides reporting and analytics, next-day settlement, and chargeback protection. Squares point-of-sale software and other business services help sellers manage inventory, locations, and employees; access financing; engage buyers; build a website or online store; and grow sales. The Cash App is an easy way to send, spend, and receive money, and Caviar is a food-ordering platform. Square was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Ireland, and the UK.Reclassifications and Other AdjustmentsDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Company has reclassified prior period balances within interest and other (income) expense, net, to disaggregate the amounts and separately present interest (income) expense, net and other (income) expense, net on its consolidated statements of operations to conform to the current period presentation. This classification change was made to provide clarity of the balances as the activity continues to grow, particularly as a result of the impact of revaluation of an equity investment in the current period. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a gain of $36.9 millionto other income on the consolidated statements of operations arising from revaluation of this investment (Note 12). There was no impact to the net income (loss) on its consolidated statements of operations to any of the periods presented as result of this change.Basis of PresentationThe accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the applicable rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. TheDecember31, 2017condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to state fairly the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss),and cash flows for the interim periods. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The interim results for thethree and ninemonths endedSeptember30, 2018are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year endingDecember31, 2018, or for any other future annual or interim period. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Items 7, 7A, and 8, respectively, in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember31, 2017.Use of Estimates The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from the Companys estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Companys financial condition or operating results will be materially affected. The Company bases its estimates on past experience and other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and the Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis.Estimates, judgments, and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, accrued transaction losses, valuation of the debt component of convertible senior notes, valuation 8of loans held for sale, goodwill, acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue, income and other taxes, and share-based compensation.Concentration of Credit RiskFor the three and ninemonths endedSeptember30, 2018and 2017, the Company had no customer that accounted for greater than 10%of total net revenue. The Company had threethird-party payment processors that represented approximately 50%, 37%, and 9%of settlements receivable as of September30, 2018. The same threeparties represented approximately 46%, 42%, and 8%of settlements receivable as of December31, 2017. All other third-party processors were insignificant. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable debt securities, settlements receivables, customer funds, and loans held for sale. The associated risk of concentration for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash is mitigated by banking with creditworthy institutions. At certain times, amounts on deposit exceed federal deposit insurance limits. The associated risk of concentration for marketable debt securities is mitigated by holding a diversified portfolio of highly rated investments. Settlements receivable are amounts due from well-established payment processing companies and normally take oneor twobusiness days to settle which mitigates the associated risk of concentration. The associated risk of concentration for loans held for sale is partially mitigated by credit evaluations that are performed prior to facilitating the offering of loans and ongoing performance monitoring of the Companys loan customers. Accounting PoliciesExcept for the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),described in Note 2, and the accounting policy on cryptocurrency transactionsand customer funds, both described below, there have been no material changes to the Companys accounting policies during theninemonths endedSeptember30, 2018, as compared to the accounting policies described in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2017.Cryptocurrency transactionsDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company started offering its Cash App customers the ability to purchase bitcoin, a cryptocurrency denominated asset, from the Company. The Company purchases bitcoin from private broker dealers or from Cash App customers. Upon purchase, the Company records the cost of bitcoin within other current assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Upon sale, the Company records the total sale amount received from customers as bitcoin revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue. The carrying value of bitcoin held by the Company was $0.2 millionand $0.3 millionas of September30, 2018and December31, 2017, respectively. The Company assesses the carrying value of bitcoin held by the Company at each reporting date and records an impairment charge if the cost exceeds the fair value. Losses on bitcoin for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018, were insignificant. Customer fundsCustomer funds represent Cash App customers' stored balances that customers can later use to send money or make payments, or customers with cash in transit. As ofDecember31, 2017, the Company held these stored balances as short term bank deposits. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company started investing a portion of these stored balances in short-term marketable debt securities (Note 5).Recent Accounting PronouncementsRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adoptedIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases, which will require, among other items, lessees to recognize a right of use asset and a related lease liability for most leases on the balance sheet. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be enhanced to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new standard should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The Company does not plan to early adopt this guidance. The 9Companys operating leases primarily comprise of office facilities, with the most significant leases relating to corporate headquarters in San Francisco and an office in New York. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements,it does expect to record material right to use assets and relatedleaseliabilities onitsconsolidated balance sheetsupon adoption, which will increase total assets and liabilities.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill assuming a hypothetical purchase price allocation (i.e., Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.This standard should be adopted when the Company performs its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning afterDecember 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08,Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium, shortening such period to the earliest call date. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning afterDecember 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. When the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted in December 2017, there was a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets included within the Company's accumulated other comprehensive income; therefore no tax expense resulted from the change in the federal income tax rate. This guidance allows companies to reclassify such tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which will remove, modify and add disclosure requirements for fair value measurements to improve the overall usefulness of such disclosures. This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any removed or modified disclosure requirements. Transition is on a prospective basis for the new and modified disclosures, and on a retrospective basis for disclosures that have been eliminated. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15,Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which is intended to align the requirements for capitalization of implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the existing guidance for internal-use software.This guidanceis effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The guidance provides flexibility in adoption, allowing for either retrospective adjustment or prospective adjustment for all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption.The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.10NOTE 2- REVENUEAdoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with CustomersOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic revenue recognition methodology under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.The Company recorded a net reduction to retained earnings of $4.6 millionas of January 1, 2018, due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, primarily related to the effect on revenue and associated cost of revenue from hardware sold through the retail distribution channels and hardware installment sales. The impact to revenue for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018was an increase of $1.6 millionand $5.3 million, respectively, as a result of applying ASC 606.For the three months ended September30, 2018, the revenue recognized from contracts with customers was $857.7 millionand revenue from other sources was $24.5 million.

The Company's contracts with customers generally do not include multiple performance obligations with differing patterns of revenue recognition, except for domain name registration offered with website hosting services sold after May 31, 2018 following the acquisition of Weebly (Note 8).The following table presents the Company's revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by revenue source (in thousands):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2018201720182017Revenue from Contracts with Customers:Transaction-based revenue$655,384$510,019$1,803,649$1,395,562Subscription and services-based revenue141,75265,051330,637173,262Hardware revenue17,55810,08950,33729,394Bitcoin revenue$42,963$$114,074$Transaction-based revenueThe Company charges its sellers a transaction fee for managed payments solutions that is generally calculated as a percentage of the total transaction amount processed. The Company selectively offers custom pricing for certain sellers.The Company collects the transaction amount from the seller's customer's bank, net of acquiring interchange and assessment fees, processing fees, and bank settlement fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions. The Company retains its fees and remits the net amount to the sellers. The Company acts as the merchant of record for its sellers and works directly with payment card networks and banks so that its sellers do not need to manage the complex systems, rules, and requirements of the payments industry. The Company satisfies its performance obligations and therefore recognizes the transaction fees as revenue upon authorization of a transaction by the seller's customer's bank. Revenue is recognized net of refunds, which arise from reversals of transactions initiated by sellers.The transaction fees collected from sellers are recognized as revenue on a gross basis as the Company is the principal in the delivery of the managed payments solutions to the sellers. The Company has concluded it is the principal because as the merchant of record, it controls the services before delivery to the seller, it is primarily responsible for the delivery of the services to its sellers, and it has discretion in setting prices charged to sellers. The Company also has the unilateral ability to accept or reject a transaction based on criteria established by the Company. As the merchant of record, Square is liable for the costs of processing the transactions for its sellers, and records such costs within cost of revenue.Subscription and services-based revenueSubscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of revenue the Company generates from Instant Deposit and Cash Card, Caviar, website hosting and domain name registration services, and various other software as a service (SaaS) products. Instant Deposit is a functionality within the Cash App and the Company's managed payments solution that enables customers, including individualsandsellers, to instantly deposit funds into their bank accounts. The Company charges a per transaction fee which is recognized as revenue when customers instantly deposit funds to their bank account. The Company also offers Cash App customers the ability to use funds stored in the Cash App via a Visa debit card, for which the Company charges a per transaction fee that is recorded as revenue. 12Caviar is a food ordering platform that facilitates food delivery services. The Company's performance obligations are the delivery of food orders from restaurants to customers and the provision of catered meals to corporate customers. For delivery of food orders, the Company charges fees to restaurants, as sellers, and also charges delivery and service fees to individuals. For provision of catered meals the Company charges corporate customers a fee. All fees are billed upon delivery of food orders or catered meals, when the Company considers that it has satisfied its performance obligations. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the food orders or catered meals, net of refunds. Refunds are estimated based on historical experience.Following the acquisition of Weebly, the Company offers customers website hosting services for a fee that is generally billed at inception. The Company also acts as a reseller of domain names registration services for a registrar for a fee, which is also generally billed at inception. The Company considers that it satisfies its performance obligations over time and as such recognizes revenue ratably over the term of the relevant arrangements, which vary from one month to twenty four months for website hosting, and one year to ten years for domain name registration. SaaS represents software products and solutions that provide customers with access to various technologies for a fee which is recognized as revenue ratably as the service is provided. The Company's contracts with customers are generally for a term of one month and renew automatically each month. The Company invoices its customers monthly. The Company considers that it satisfies its performance obligations over time each month as it provides the SaaS services to customers and hence recognizes revenue ratably over the month.Hardware revenueThe Company generates revenue through the sale of hardware through e-commerce and through its retail distribution channels. The Company satisfies its performance obligation upon delivery of hardware to its customers who include end user customers, distributors, and retailers. The Company may at times offer concessions to customers and also allow for customer returns, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates these amounts based on historical experience and reduces revenue recognized. The Company invoices end user customers upon delivery of the products to customers, and payments from such customers are due upon invoicing. Distributors and retailers have payment terms that range from 30 to 90 days after delivery. The Company offers hardware installment sales to customers with terms ranging from three to twenty four months. The Company allocates a portion of the consideration received from these arrangements to a financing component when it determines that a significant financing component exists. The financing component is subsequently recognized as financing revenue separate from hardware revenue, within subscription and services-based revenue, over the terms of the arrangement with the customer. Bitcoin revenueDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company started offering its Cash App customers the ability to purchase bitcoin, a cryptocurrency denominated asset, from the Company. The Company satisfies its performance obligation and records revenue when bitcoin is transferred to the customer's account. Arrangements with Multiple Performance ObligationsThe Company also offers its customers the option to buy website hosting bundled with domain name registration, and infrequently the Company has offered its hardware customers free managed payments solutions with the purchase of its hardware as part of a marketing promotion. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers since the Company's products and services are normally sold on a stand alone basis.Deferred RevenueDeferred revenue is primarily comprised of payments for website hosting and domain name registration received from customers at inception of the arrangements prior to the services being rendered. Deferred revenue also includes unearned revenue related to managed payments services offered in conjunction with hardware sales for which the cash payments from customers are received and due upon the sale of the hardware.13The deferred revenue balances were as follows (in thousands):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2018201720182017Deferred revenue, beginning of the period$27,155$4,523$5,893$5,407Less: accumulative adjustment for adoption of ASC 606(4,303)Deferred revenue, beginning of the period, as adjusted27,1554,5231,5905,407Deferred revenue, end of the period33,6143,42433,6143,424Deferred revenue arising from business combination22,80022,800Revenue recognized in the period from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period$10,165$2,060$1,539$5,312Practical ExpedientsThe Company does not recognize a financing component for hardware installment sales that have a term of one year or less. NOTE 3- RESTRICTED CASHAs of September30, 2018andDecember31, 2017, restricted cash of $33.2 millionand $28.8 million, respectively, is related to pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process the Company's sellers' payment transactions and as collateral pursuant to an agreement with the originating bank for the Company's loan product.The Company uses the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with the financial institution to provide collateral for cash flow timing differences in the processing of these payments. The Company has recorded this amount as a current asset on the consolidated balance sheets due to the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted. Additionally, this balance includes certain amounts held as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements, discussed in the paragraph below, which we expect to become unrestricted within the next year.As of September30, 2018andDecember31, 2017, the remaining restricted cash of $10.1 millionand $9.8 million, respectively, is primarily related to cash deposited into money market funds that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements (Note 18). The Company has recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets as the terms of the related leases extend beyond one year. NOTE 4- INVESTMENTSThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable debt securities as available-for-sale.14The Company's short-term and long-term investments as ofSeptember30, 2018are as follows (in thousands):Amortized CostGross Unrealized GainsGross Unrealized LossesFair ValueShort-term debt securities:U.S. agency securities$48,206$11$(27)$48,190Corporate bonds83,647135(64)83,718Municipal securities28,90437(49)28,892U.S. government securities270,09470(372)269,792Non-U.S. government securities18,433(39)18,394Total$449,284$253$(551)$448,986Long-term debt securities:U.S. agency securities$132,013$1$(244)$131,770Corporate bonds160,777178(75)160,880Municipal securities20,20382(45)20,240U.S. government securities221,751202(419)221,534Non-U.S. government securities3,251(12)3,239Total$537,995$463$(795)$537,663The Company's short-term and long-term investments as ofDecember31, 2017are as follows (in thousands):Amortized CostGross Unrealized GainsGross Unrealized LossesFair ValueShort-term debt securities:U.S. agency securities$15,122$$(39)$15,083Corporate bonds57,85522(79)57,798Commercial paper17,42817,428Municipal securities23,7438(51)23,700U.S. government securities55,7291(163)55,567Total$169,877$31$(332)$169,576Long-term debt securities:U.S. agency securities$20,288$2$(121)$20,169Corporate bonds91,95925(571)91,413Municipal securities26,37113(160)26,224U.S. government securities66,36219(520)65,861Total$204,980$59$(1,372)$203,667For the periods presented, gains or losses realized on the sale of investments were not material.

For the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018, the Company recorded a charge for the excess of amortized cost over fair value of the loans of $3.3 millionand $9.0 million, respectively. For the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2017, the Company recorded a charge for the excess of amortized cost over fair value of the loans of $3.4 millionand $6.1 million, respectively. If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.

Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was$7.3 millionand $21.8 millionfor the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2017, respectively.NOTE 8- ACQUISITIONSWeebly, Inc.On May31, 2018, the Company acquired 100%of the outstanding shares of Weebly, a technology company that offers customers website hosting and domain name registration solutions. The acquisition of Weebly enables the Company to combine Weeblys web presence tools with the Company's in-person and online offerings to create a cohesive solution for sellers to start or grow an omnichannel business. The acquisition will also expand the Companys customer base globally and add a new recurring revenue stream.The purchase consideration was comprised of $132.4 millionin cash and 2,418,271shares of the Companys Class A common stock with an aggregate fair value of $140.1 millionbased on the closing price of the Companys Class A common stock on the acquisition date. As part of the acquisition, the Company paid an aggregate of $17.7 millionin cash and shares to settle outstanding vested and unvested employee options, of which $2.6 millionwas accounted for as post-combination compensation expense and is excluded from the purchase consideration. Third-party acquisition-related costs were insignificant. The results of Weebly's operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the closing date.The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. This method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquired entity and the fair value of the net assets acquired be recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.The table below summarizes the consideration paid for Weebly and the preliminary assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date (in thousands, except share data). Consideration:Cash$132,432Stock (2,418,271 shares of Class A common stock)140,107$272,539Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:Current assets (inclusive of cash acquired of $25,758)$44,685Intangible customer assets42,700Intangible technology assets14,900Intangible trade name11,300Intangible other assets961Total liabilities assumed (including deferred revenue of $22,800)(35,849)Total identifiable net assets acquired78,697Goodwill193,842Total$272,539The Company prepared an initial determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date using preliminary information. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company has recognized measurement period adjustments to the purchase consideration and the fair value of certain liabilities assumed as a result of further refinements in the Companys estimates.These adjustments were prospectively applied. The effect of these adjustments on the preliminary purchase price allocation was an increase in goodwill and tax liabilities assumed of$4.3 millionand$3.0 million, respectively.There was no impact to the consolidated statements of operations as result of these adjustments. The Company continues the process of completing the valuation of the acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue and evaluating contingencies and tax effects related to the acquisition. Accordingly, the preliminary values reflected in the table above are subject to change.19As of September30, 2018, $19.9 millionof cash and 372,578shares of the total consideration were withheld as security for indemnification obligations related to general representations and warranties, in addition to certain potential tax exposures.Goodwill from the Weebly acquisition is primarily attributable to the value of expected synergies created by incorporating Weebly solutions into the Company's technology platform and the value of the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill generated from the Weebly acquisition or the acquired intangible assets are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Additionally the acquisition would have resulted in recognition of deferred tax assets arising mainly from the net of deferred tax assets from acquired net operating losses (NOLs) and research and development credits, and deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets and deferred revenue. However, the realization of such deferred tax assets depends primarily on the Company's post-acquisition ability to generate taxable income in future periods. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against the net acquired deferred tax asset in accounting for the acquisition.The acquisition of Weebly did not have a material impact on the Company's reported revenue or net loss amounts for any period presented. Accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.Other acquisitions The Company also spent an aggregate of $9.9 million, net of cash acquired,in connection with other immaterial acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which resulted in the recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of our acquisitions as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.NOTE 9- GOODWILLGoodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition of a business exceeds the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The change in carrying value of goodwill in the period was as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2017$58,327Acquisitions completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2018201,637Balance at September 30, 2018$259,964The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually on December 31 and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For the periods presented, the Company had recorded noimpairment charges. 20NOTE 10- ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe Company entered into twotransactions accounted for as business combinations during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, that involved the acquisition of intangible assets.

This revolving credit agreement is secured by certain tangible and intangible assets. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at the Companys option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00%to 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00%to 2.00%. This margin is determined based on the Companys total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. The Company is obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an annual administrative agent fee of $0.1 millionand an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. To date no funds have been drawn under the credit facility, with $375.0 millionremaining available. The Company paid $0.1 millionand $0.4 millionin unused commitment fees during both the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018and 2017, respectively. As of September30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants associated with this credit facility. Convertible Senior Notes due in 2023 OnMay25, 2018, the Company issuedan aggregate principal amount of $750.0 millionof convertible senior notes and an additional 15%or $112.5 millionpursuant to the exercise in full of the option to the initial purchaser to cover over-allotments (2023 Notes). The 2023 Notes mature onMay15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of0.50%payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2023 Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of12.8456shares of the Company's Class A common stock per$1,000principal amount of 2023 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$77.85per share of Class A common stock. Holders may convert their 2023 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2023 only under the following circumstances: (1)during any calendar quarter commencing after September30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Companys Class A common stock for at least 20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2)during the fivebusiness day period after any fiveconsecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes) per $1,000principal amount of 2023 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98%of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3)upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, including certain distributions, the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes) or a transaction resulting in the Companys Class A common stock converting into other securities or property or assets.On or afterFebruary15, 2023, up until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its 2023 Notes regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Companys election. Effective October 2018, the Company revised its prior stated policy of settling conversions through combination settlement with a specified dollar amount of $1,000per $1,000principal amount of 2023 Notes, and currently expects to settle future conversions entirely in shares of the Company's Class A common stock. The Company will reevaluate this policy from time to time as conversion notices are received from holders of the 2023 Notes.In accounting for the issuance of the 2023 Notes, the Company separated the 2023 Notes into liability and equity components.The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was $155.3 millionand was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2023 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount ("debt discount") is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes at an effective interest rate of 4.69%over the contractual terms of the Notes.Debt issuance costs related to the 2023 Notes comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers of $6.0 millionand third party offering costs of $0.8 million.The Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2023 Notes based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component 25were $5.6 millionand will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term.Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders equity.Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022OnMarch6, 2017, the Company issuedan aggregate principal amount of $400.0 millionof convertible senior notes and an additional 10%or $40.0million pursuant to the exercise in full of the option to the initial purchasers to cover over-allotments (2022 Notes). The 2022 Notes mature onMarch1, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of0.375%payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of43.5749shares of the Company's Class A common stock per$1,000principal amount of 2022 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$22.95per share of Class A common stock. Holders may convert their 2022 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2021 only under the following circumstances: (1)during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Companys Class A common stock for at least 20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2)during the fivebusiness day period after any fiveconsecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Notes) per $1,000principal amount of 2022 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98%of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3)upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, including certain distributions, the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Notes) or a transaction resulting in the Companys Class A common stock converting into other securities or property or assets.On or afterDecember1, 2021, up until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its 2022 Notes regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Companys election. The circumstances required to allow the holders to convert their 2022 Notes were met starting January 1, 2018. During the third quarter of 2018, certain holders of the 2022 Notes converted an aggregate principal amount of $70.0 millionof their Notes. The Company settled the principal amount in cash and the balance by issuing 2.2 millionshares of the Company's Class A common stock. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018, the Company had received notification from certain holders of the 2022 Notes of their intention to convert an aggregate principal amount of $149.0 millionof 2022 Notes, that are expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2018 through a combination of cash and shares of the Company's Class A common stock. Effective October 2018, the Company revised its prior stated policy of settling conversions through combination settlement with a specified dollar amount of $1,000per $1,000principal amount of 2022 Notes. The Company currently expects to settle future conversions in shares of the Company's Class A common stock. The Company will reevaluate this policy from time to time as conversion notices are received from holders of the 2022 Notes.In accounting for the issuance of the 2022 Notes, the Company separated the 2022 Notes into liability and equity components.The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was $86.2 millionand was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2022 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2022 Notes at an effective interest rate of 5.34%over the contractual terms of the Notes. Debt issuance costs related to the 2022 Notes comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers of $11.0 millionand third party offering costs of $0.8 million.The Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2022 Notes based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were $9.4 millionand will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term.Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders equity.The debt component associated with the 2022 Notes that were converted was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, with the Company recording loss on extinguishment of $1.6 million, as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of such 2022 Notes. The equity component associated with the 2022 Notes that were converted was accounted for as a reacquisition of equity upon the conversion of such 2022 Notes. Accordingly, the excess of the fair value of the consideration issued to settle the conversion over the fair value of the debt component of $9.3 millionwas accounted for as a reduction to the additional paid in capital. 26The net carrying amount of the Notes were as follows (in thousands):Principal outstandingUnamortized debt discountUnamortized debt issuance costsNet carrying valueSeptember 30, 20182023 Notes$862,500$(145,998)$(5,273)$711,2292022 Notes369,953(51,581)(5,654)312,718Total1,232,453(197,579)(10,927)1,023,947December 31, 20172022 Notes$440,000$(73,384)$(8,044)$358,572The net carrying amount of the equity component of the Notes were as follows (in thousands):Amount allocated to conversion optionLess: allocated issuance costsEquity component, netSeptember 30, 20182023 Notes$155,250$(1,231)$154,0192022 Notes72,480(1,936)70,544Total227,730(3,167)224,563December 31, 20172022 Notes$86,203$(2,302)$83,901The Company recognized interest expense on the Notes as follows (in thousands, except for percentages):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2018201720182017Contractual interest expense$1,469$413$2,732$938Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs11,6274,27722,8509,889Total$13,096$4,690$25,582$10,827The effective interest rate of the liability component is 4.69%and 5.34%for the 2023 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively. Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant TransactionsIn connection with the offering of the 2023 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (2023 convertible note hedges) with certain financial institution counterparties whereby the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 11.1 millionshares of its Class A common stock at a price of approximately $77.85per share. The total cost of the 2023 convertible note hedge transactions was $172.6 million. In addition, the Company sold warrants (2023 warrants) to the counterparties whereby the counterparties have the option to purchase a total of 11.1 millionshares of the Companys Class A common stock at a price of approximately $109.26per share. The Company received $112.1 millionin cash proceeds from the sale of the 2023 warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the 2023 convertible note hedges and sale of the 2023 warrants 27are intended to reduce dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 2023 Notes, as the case may be, and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $77.85per share to approximately $109.26per share. As these instruments are considered indexed to the Company's own stock and are considered equity classified, the 2023 convertible note hedges and 2023 warrants are recorded in stockholders equity, are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period. The net costs incurred in connection with the 2023 convertible note hedge and 2023 warrant transactions were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (2022 convertible note hedges) with certain financial institution counterparties whereby the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 19.2 millionshares of its Class A common stock at a price of approximately $22.95per share. The total cost of the 2022 convertible note hedge transactions was $92.1 million. In addition, the Company sold warrants (2022 warrants) to the counterparties whereby the counterparties have the option to purchase a total of 19.2 millionshares of the Companys Class A common stock at a price of approximately $31.18per share. The Company received $57.2million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2022 warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the 2022 convertible note hedges and sale of the 2022 warrants are intended to reduce dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 2022 Notes, as the case may be, and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $22.95per share to approximately $31.18per share. As these instruments are considered indexed to the Company's own stock and are considered equity classified, the 2022 convertible note hedges and 2022 warrants are recorded in stockholders equity, are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period. The net costs incurred in connection with the 2022 convertible note hedge and 2022 warrant transactions were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company exercised a pro-rata portion of the 2022 convertible note hedges to offset the shares of the Company's Class A common stock issued to settle the conversion of the 2022 Notes discussed above. The 2022 convertible note hedges were net share settled, and the Company received 2.2 millionshares of the Company's Class A common stock from the counterparties. NOTE 14- ACCRUED TRANSACTION LOSSESThe Company is exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility.The following table summarizes the activities of the Companys reserve for transaction losses (in thousands):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2018201720182017Accrued transaction losses, beginning of the period$29,207$22,455$26,893$20,064Provision for transaction losses20,44915,10248,79439,737Charge-offs to accrued transaction losses(14,324)(10,837)(40,355)(33,081)Accrued transaction losses, end of the period$35,332$26,720$35,332$26,720NOTE 15- INCOME TAXESThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $1.1 millionand $1.8 millionfor the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018, respectively, compared to income tax (benefit) expense of $(0.6) millionand $0.3 millionfor the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2017, respectively. The income tax expense recorded for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018was primarily due to state and foreign income tax expense offset by a release in the U.S. valuation allowance.The Companys effective tax rate was 5.1%and (22.0)%for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018, respectively, compared to an effective tax rate of 3.9%and (0.7)%for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2017, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018and September30, 2017primarily relates to the valuation allowance on the Companys deferred tax assets and the income tax benefit of the monetization of its alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit in 2017.28The Companys effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where the Company conducts business.As of September30, 2018, the Company retains a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The realization of the Companys deferred tax assets depends primarily on its ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable in future periods may change as management continues to reassess the underlying factors it uses in estimating future taxable income. The tax provision for the three and ninemonths ended September30, 2018and September30, 2017, was calculated on a jurisdictional basis. The Company estimated the foreign income tax provision using the effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act). During the third quarter of 2018, the Company finalized its federal and state income tax returns, making no material adjustments to provisional amounts previously recorded.If additional guidance clarifying aspects of the Tax Act is released, any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense as a change in tax law.NOTE 16- STOCKHOLDERS EQUITYThe changes in total stockholders equity were as follows (in thousands):Total stockholders equityBalance at December 31, 2017$786,333Net loss(10,249)Exercise of stock options82,202Purchases under the employee stock purchase plan12,578Vesting of early exercised stock options and other136Issuance of common stock in connection with business combination140,107Replacement stock awards issued in connection with acquisition899Conversion feature of convertible senior notes, due 2023, net of allocated costs 154,019Purchase of bond hedges in conjunction with issuance of convertible senior notes, due 2023(172,586)Sale of warrants in conjunction with issuance of convertible senior notes, due 2023112,125Issuance of common stock in conjunction with the conversion of senior notes, due 2022(9,305)Exercise of bond hedges in conjunction with the conversion of senior notes, due 2022Share-based compensation 164,142Tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units(125,899)Cumulative adjustment for adoption of ASC 606(4,586)Recovery of common stock in connection with indemnification settlement agreement(2,745)Change in other comprehensive loss(5,027)Balance at September 30, 2018$1,122,14429Common StockThe Company has authorized the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

Upon reaching the agreement, the Company recorded an indemnification asset of $2.8 millionand a corresponding credit to expense to compensate for the costs previously incurred in connection with Caviar preacquisition claims. The remaining value of the forfeited shares was treated as an equity repurchase.Conversion of 2022 Notes and Exercise of the 2022 Convertible Note HedgesIn connection with the conversion of certain of the 2022 Notes, the Company issued 2.2 millionshares of Class A common stock. The Company also exercised a pro-rata portion of the 2022 convertible note hedges and received 2.2 millionshares of Class A common stock from the counterparties to offset the shares issued.Stock PlansThe Company maintains twoshare-based employee compensation plans: the 2009 Stock Plan (2009 Plan) and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan).

Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of all potential shares of common stock. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive given the Companys net loss.32The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2018201720182017Numerator:Net income (loss)$19,643$(16,098)$(10,249)$(47,150)Denominator:Basic shares:Weighted-average common shares outstanding410,095385,409403,577377,374Weighted-average unvested shares(405)(1,458)(597)(1,631)Weighted-average shares used to compute basic net income (loss) per share409,690383,951402,980375,743Diluted shares:Stock options and restricted stock units47,175Convertible senior notes6,409Common stock warrants11,422Employee stock purchase plan219Weighted-average shares used to compute diluted net income (loss) per share474,915383,951402,980375,743Net income (loss) per share:Basic$0.05$(0.04)$(0.03)$(0.13)Diluted$0.04$(0.04)$(0.03)$(0.13)Additionally, since the Company has revised its policy and now intends to settle future conversions of its outstanding 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes entirely in shares of its Class A common stock, the Company will consider the number of shares expected to be issued in calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversions, if applicable.

The Treasurer & Tax Collector of the City and County of San Francisco (Tax Collector) has issued a decision for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, that the Tax Collector believes the Companys primary business activity is financial services rather than information services, and accordingly, the Company would be liable for the Gross Receipts Tax and Payroll Expense Tax under the rules for financial services business activities. The Company paid the liability for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 in the first quarter of 2018, as assessed by the Tax Collector. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position, which it believes has merit. Should the Company not prevail, the Company could be obligated to pay additional taxes together with any associated penalties and interest for subsequent years that together, in aggregate, could be material. The Company is currently unable to estimate the range of possible loss given the uncertainties associated with this matter, including uncertainties about the Tax Collectors rationale for its position and about the amounts that may ultimately be subject to such taxes.On May 14, 2018, Joshua Woodle, on behalf of a class of couriers who have delivered with Caviar in California, filed a lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court against the Company doing business as Caviar, which alleges that Caviar misclassified Mr. Woodle and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors and, in doing so, violated various provisions of the California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief.The Court compelled arbitration of Mr. Woodles arbitrable claims on November 5, 2018. On August 24, 2018, Mervyn Cole, on behalf of the State of California and similarly situated couriers who have delivered with Caviar in California filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against the Company doing business as Caviar. The complaint alleges that Caviar misclassified Mr. Cole and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors and, in doing so, violated certain provisions of the California Labor Code. The action is being brought as a representative action under the Private Attorneys 34General Act (PAGA). Plaintiffs seek civil penalties and injunctive relief. Given the early stage of these proceedings, it is not yet possible to reliably determine any potential liability that could result from these matters. In addition, from time to time, the Company is involved in various other litigation matters and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. The Companycannot at this time fairly estimate a reasonable range of exposure, if any, of the potential liability with respect to these other matters. While the Company does not believe, at this time, that any ultimate liability resulting from any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, the Company cannot give any assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of these other matters, and their resolution could be material to the Company's operating results for any particular period.NOTE 19- SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATIONOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Companys CODM is the chief executive officer who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Companys operations constitute a single operating segment and onereportable segment.RevenueRevenue by geography is based on the billing addresses of the sellers or customers.

Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Overview We started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to give these businesses access to the same tools as large businesses. Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps our sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. We combine sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile and computing devices into powerful payment and point-of-sale solutions. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable. The foundation of our ecosystem is a full service, managed payments offering. Once a seller downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile app, they can quickly and easily take their first payment because we can typically bring them onto our system in minutes. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via magnetic stripe (a swipe), EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) (a dip), or NFC (Near Field Communication) (a tap); or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the sellers website or app. Once on our system, sellers gain access to technology and features such as reporting and analytics, next-day settlements, digital receipts, payment dispute and chargeback management, security, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. Our commerce ecosystem also includes powerful point-of-sale software and services that help sellers make informed business decisions through the use of analytics and reporting. As a result, sellers can manage orders, inventory, locations, employees, and payroll; engage and grow their sales with customers; and gain access to business loans through our Square Capital service. Some of these advanced point-of-sale features are broadly applicable to our seller base and include Employee Management and Customer Engagement. We have also extended our ecosystem to serve sellers with more specific needs. Our Build with Square developer platform (application programming interface or APIs) allows businesses with individualized needs to customize their business solutions while processing payments on Square and taking advantage of all the services in our ecosystem, including integration with third-party applications. In addition, certain verticals, such as service and retail sellers, benefit from specific features such as Invoices, Appointments, and Square for Retail. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee. In the same way that we have empowered businesses with fast, simple, and cohesive tools, we see an opportunity with Cash App to build a similar ecosystem of services for individuals. Cash App offers individuals access to a fast, easy way to send and receive money electronically to and from individuals and businesses. We offer Cash App customers the ability to store their funds as well as use their funds via Cash Card, a Visa debit card. We have added the capability for customers to receive direct deposit payments (such as those from an employer) and ACH payments from financial institutions. Customers can also use their Cash Card to withdraw funds at ATMs. During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Cash Boost, a rewards program that gives customers instant discounts when they make Cash Card purchases. Additionally, customers can buy and sell bitcoin in Cash App. We also serve sellers through Caviar, our food ordering platform that helps restaurants reach new customers and increase sales without additional overhead. Caviar makes it easy for restaurants to offer diners more ways to orderdelivery, pickup, group ordering for individuals or corporate customershandling all the logistics and technology so the restaurant can focus on food. Caviar revenue consists of seller fees charged to restaurants and delivery and service fees from consumers. For provision of catered meals the Company charges corporate customers a fee. All fees are recognized upon delivery of the food orders or catered meals, net of refunds.With Square Capital, we facilitate the offering of loans to sellers based on their payment processing history, and the product is broadly available across our seller base. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional 37third-party investors who purchase these loans. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the loans to third-party investors or over time as the sellers pay down the outstanding amounts for the loans that we hold as available for sale. We also earn a servicing fee from third-party investors that we record as revenue as we provide the services. In May2018, we acquired Weebly, Inc. (Weebly). Weebly provides customers with tools to easily build a professional website or online store. We will combine Weeblys web presence tools with Squares in-person and online offerings to create one cohesive solution for sellers of all types, including restaurants, retailers, and service providers. An integrated suite of services will make critical business tasks like engaging with customers, managing orders, growing sales, and making informed business decisions easier for sellers. We charge subscription fees for website hosting services that are generally billed at inception with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the relevant arrangement. We also provide hardware to facilitate commerce for sellers. This hardware includes magstripe readers, contactless and chip readers, chip card readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal and third-party peripherals.InMay2018, we issued$862.5 millionin aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (2023 Notes) that mature onMay15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased pursuant to their terms, and bear interest at a rate of0.50%payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transaction described below, and intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, investments, working capital, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. From time to time, we evaluate potential strategic transactions and acquisitions of businesses, technologies, products or talent.We have grown rapidly to serve millions of sellers that represent a diverse set of industries, including retail, services, and food-related businesses, and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers market to multi-location businesses. These sellers also span geographies including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom and Weebly further expanded our customer base globally.Results of OperationsRevenue (in thousands, except for percentages)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,20182017$ Change% Change20182017$ Change% ChangeTransaction-based revenue$655,384$510,019$145,36529%$1,803,649$1,395,562$408,08729%Subscription and services-based revenue166,20365,051101,152155%$397,589$173,262$224,327129%Hardware revenue17,55810,0897,46974%50,33729,394$20,94371%Bitcoin revenue$42,963$$42,963%$114,074$$114,074%Total net revenue$882,108$585,159$296,94951%$2,365,649$1,598,218$767,43148%Total net revenuefor the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $296.9 millionor 51%and $767.4 millionor 48%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017.Transaction-based revenue for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $145.4 millionor 29%and $408.1 millionor 29%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017. This increase was attributable to growth in Gross Payment Volume (GPV) processed of 29%and 30%for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017. We continue to benefit from growth in processed volumes from our existing sellers, in addition to meaningful contributions from new sellers. Additionally, GPV from larger sellers, which we define as all sellers that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV, represented 52% of our GPV in the third quarter of 2018, an increase from 48% in the third quarter of 2017. We continue to see ongoing success with attracting and enabling larger seller growth, which will help us to drive strong GPV growth as we scale.38Subscription and services-based revenue for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $101.2 millionor 155%and $224.3 millionor 129%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017. Growth was driven primarily by Instant Deposit, Caviar, Cash Card, and Square Capital, as well as acquisitions completed in the second quarter. Subscription and services-based revenue contributed 19%and 17%of total net revenue in the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018, respectively, compared to 11%in both the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017.Hardware revenue for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $7.5 millionor 74%, and $20.9 millionor 71%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017. The increase primarily reflects growth in shipments of Square Register following its launch in the fourth quarter of 2017. Square Register is our first all-in-one offering that combines our hardware, point-of-sale software, and payments technology. The increase was also driven by continued growth in sales of our contactless and chip readers, as well as growth in sales of our Square Stand and third-party peripherals driven primarily by new features and product offerings. Additionally, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase of $1.4 millionand $5.0 millionin hardware revenue for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018, respectively, primarily related to the earlier revenue recognition of hardware sold through retail distribution channels and hardware installment sales, which were previously recorded upon sell through to the end user customer.During the fourth quarter of 2017, we started offering our Cash App customers the ability to purchase bitcoin from us. Bitcoin revenuecomprises the total sale amount we receive from bitcoin sales to customers and is recorded upon transfer of bitcoin to the customer's account. The sale amount generally includes a small margin added to the price we pay to purchase bitcoin and accordingly, the amount of bitcoin revenue will fluctuate depending on the volatility of market bitcoin prices and customer demand.

Hardware costs for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $4.5 millionor 24%and $22.9 millionor 50%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017. The increase in hardware costs reflects growth in our sales of Square Register, Square Stand, third-party peripherals, and contactless and chip readers, as 39described above. Additionally, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase of $1.3 millionand $4.8 millionin hardware costs for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018, respectively, primarily related to earlier recognition of costs of hardware sold through retail distribution channels and hardware installment sales in line with the revenue recognition for such sales under ASC 606. These increases were offset in part by a manufacturing cost reduction for Square Stand as a result of an improvement in production efficiencies.Bitcoin cost of revenue comprises of the amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with the price of bitcoin in the market.

We record loan losses when the amortized cost of a loan exceeds the estimated fair value of the loan, as determined at the individual loan level; andAmortization of acquired customer assets for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $1.1 millionor 483%and $1.6 millionor 244%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017, as a result of additional customer assets acquired through the business combinations in the second quarter of 2018 offset in part by certain customer assets reaching end of life.Interest Expense, Net, and Other Income, Net (in thousands, except for percentages)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,20182017$ Change% Change20182017$ Change% ChangeInterest expense, net$7,224$3,080$4,144135%$12,806$7,570$5,23669%Other income, net$(37,800)$(1,226)$(36,574)NM$(37,908)$(1,951)$(35,957)NMInterest expense, net, for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $4.1 millionand $5.2 million, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017, primarily due to interest expense related to our convertible notes issued in March 2017 and in May 2018, offset in part by interest income earned on our investment in marketable debt securities. 41Other income, net, for the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2018increased by $36.6 millionand $36.0 million, respectively, compared to the three and nine months endedSeptember30, 2017, primarily due to a gain of $36.9 millionarising from revaluation of an equity investment in Eventbrite, Inc (Eventbrite) as result of their initial public offering and subsequent mark to market of this investment. Gains or losses arising from marking to market this investment may fluctuate significantly in the future periods due to volatility of the investee stock price. This activity was offset in part by a $1.6 millionloss recorded on the extinguishment of long-term debt.

The increase for the nine months ended September30, 2018, is due to a change in the mix of U.S. and international income offset by a release in the U.S. valuation allowance compared with the income tax benefit of the monetization of our AMT credit in 2017.Key Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources, and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenue, net income (loss), and other results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following table sets forth key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business. We believe these metrics and measures are useful to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business and to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of other payments solution providers. Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2018201720182017(in thousands, except GPV and per share data)Gross Payment Volume (GPV) (in millions)$22,498$17,386$61,696$47,454Adjusted Revenue$431,136$257,116$1,123,389$701,305Adjusted EBITDA$70,997$34,304$175,213$97,825Adjusted Net Income Per Share:Basic $0.16$0.08$0.39$0.21Diluted$0.13$0.07$0.33$0.19Gross Payment Volume (GPV)We define GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. Additionally, GPV includes Cash App activity related to peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card and Cash for Business.42Adjusted RevenueAdjusted Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as our total net revenue less transaction-based costs and bitcoin costs, and we add back the impact of the acquired deferred revenue adjustment, which was written down to fair value in purchase accounting. We believe it is useful to subtract transaction-based costs and bitcoin costs from total net revenue to derive Adjusted Revenue as this is a primary metric used by management to measure our business performance, and it affords greater comparability to other payments solution providers. Substantially all of the transaction-based costs are interchange and assessment fees, processing fees, and bank settlement fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions. While some payments solution providers present their revenue in a similar fashion to us, others present their revenue net of transaction-based costs because, unlike us, they pass through these costs directly to their sellers and are not deemed the principal in these arrangements. Under our standard pricing model, we do not pass through these costs directly to our sellers. We also deduct bitcoin costs because we consider our role in the bitcoin transactions to be facilitating customer access to bitcoin. Since we only apply a small margin to the market cost of bitcoin when we sell bitcoin to customers, and we have no control over the cost of bitcoin in the market which tends to be volatile, we believe deducting bitcoin costs is a better reflection of the economic benefits as well as the Company's performance from the bitcoin transactions. We recognize acquired deferred revenue that was written down for purchase accounting since we believe that it is correlated with ordinary and ongoing operations of the acquired company and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and business trends. The acquired deferred revenue adjustment was not included in prior periods because it was immaterial or zero. Adjusted Revenue has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:Adjusted Revenue is net of transaction-based costs, which is our largest cost of revenue item; Adjusted Revenue is net of bitcoin costs, which could be a significant cost; The deferred revenue adjustment that is added back to Adjusted Revenue will never be recognized as revenue by the Company; andother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Revenue differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Revenue alongside other financial performance measures, including total net revenue and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of total net revenue to Adjusted Revenue for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2018201720182017Total net revenue$882,108$585,159$2,365,649$1,598,218Less: transaction-based costs414,456328,0431,137,716896,913Less: bitcoin costs42,408112,876Add: deferred revenue adjustment related to purchase accounting5,8928,332Adjusted Revenue$431,136$257,116$1,123,389$701,305Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income Per ShareAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are non-GAAP financial measures that represent our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same 43manner as our management and board of directors. In addition, they provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as they remove the effect of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation expenses, from our non-GAAP financial measures because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.In connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes (as described in Note 13), we are required to recognize non-cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. We believe that excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because such incremental non-cash interest expense does not represent a current or future cash outflow for the Company and is therefore not indicative of our continuing operations or meaningful when comparing current results to past results.We exclude the gain or loss on the disposal of property and equipment, gain or loss on revaluation of equity investment, gain or loss on debt extinguishment related to the conversion of senior notes and impairment of intangible assets, as applicable, from non-GAAP financial measures because we do not believe that these items are reflective of our ongoing business operations.We also exclude certain costs associated with acquisitions that are not normal recurring operating expenses, including amounts paid to redeem acquirees unvested share-based compensation awards, and legal, accounting and due diligence costs, and we add back the impact of the acquired deferred revenue and deferred cost adjustment, which was written down to fair value in purchase accounting. Such amounts were not included in prior periods as they were immaterial or zero. In addition to the items above, Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure also excludes depreciation, other cash interest income and expense, other income and expense and provision or benefit from income taxes, as these items are not components of our core business operations. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:share-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;the intangible assets being amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or other capital commitments; andnon-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.In addition to the limitations above, Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure does not reflect the effect of depreciation expense and related cash capital requirements, income taxes that may represent a reduction in cash available to us, and the effect of foreign currency exchange gains or losses which is included in other income and expense. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.Because of these limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 44The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2018201720182017Net income (loss)$19,643$(16,098)$(10,249)$(47,150)Share-based compensation expense58,91340,048157,856111,311Depreciation and amortization15,8359,08538,32327,647Interest expense, net7,2243,08012,8067,570Other income, net(37,800)(1,226)(37,908)(1,951)Provision (benefit) for income taxes1,066(647)1,845334Loss on disposal of property and equipment8066278164Acquisition related costs3454,708Acquired deferred revenue adjustment5,8928,332Acquired deferred costs adjustment(927)(1,281)Adjusted EBITDA$70,997$34,304$175,213$97,825The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2018201720182017Net income (loss)$19,643$(16,098)$(10,249)$(47,150)Share-based compensation expense58,91340,048157,856111,311Amortization of intangible assets4,3841,8049,0755,868Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs11,6274,27722,8509,889Gain on revaluation of equity investment(36,908)(36,908)Loss on extinguishment of long-term debt1,6251,625Loss on disposal of property and equipment8066278164Acquisition related costs3454,708Acquired deferred revenue adjustment5,8928,332Acquired deferred costs adjustment(927)(1,281)Adjusted Net Income$65,400$30,093$156,789$79,982Adjusted Net Income Per Share:Basic$0.16$0.08$0.39$0.21Diluted$0.13$0.07$0.33$0.19Weighted-average shares used to compute Adjusted Net Income Per Share:Basic409,690383,951402,980375,743Diluted495,621432,284475,801418,419Basic Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share is computed by dividing the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

As of September30, 2018, we had $1,708.4 millionof cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities, which were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. OnMarch6, 2017, we issued$440.0 millionin aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (2022 Notes) that mature onMarch1, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of0.375%payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of43.5749shares of Class A common stock per$1,000principal amount of 2022 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$22.95per share of Class A common stock. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (2022 convertible note hedges) with certain financial institution counterparties whereby we have the option to purchase a total of approximately 19.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of approximately $22.95 per share. The total cost of the 2022 convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $92.1 million. In addition, we sold warrants (2022 warrants) to the counterparties whereby the counterparties have the option to purchase a total of approximately 19.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of approximately $31.18 per share. We received approximately $57.2 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2022 warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the 2022 convertible note hedges and sale of the 2022 warrants are intended to reduce and/or offset dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes. The net proceeds from this transaction, after issuance costs was approximately $393.4 million. During the third quarter of 2018, we settled the conversion of 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal of $70.0 million through a cash payment for the principal and issuance of 2.2 million shares of our common stock for the balance of the value. As of September 30, 2018, we also had received notification from holders of the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $149.0 millionof their intent to convert their notes. We expect to settle these notes through a cash payment for the principal and issue shares of our common stock to settle the balance. We have revised our policy of settling the principal amount of notes in cash and expect to settle other future conversions entirely in shares. 46OnMay25, 2018, we issued$862.5 millionin aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (2023 Notes) that mature onMay15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of0.50%payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2023 Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of12.8456shares of our Class A common stock per$1,000principal amount of 2023 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$77.85per share of Class A common stock. In connection with the offering of the 2023 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (2023 convertible note hedges) with certain financial institution counterparties whereby we have the option to purchase a total of approximately 11.1 millionshares of our Class A common stock at a price of approximately $77.85per share. The total cost of the 2023 convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $172.6 million. In addition, we sold warrants (2023 warrants) to the counterparties whereby the counterparties have the option to purchase a total of approximately 11.1 millionshares of our Class A common stock at a price of approximately $109.26per share. We received approximately $112.1 millionin cash proceeds from the sale of the 2023 warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the 2023 convertible note hedges and sale of the 2023 warrants are intended to reduce and/or offset dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes. The net proceeds from this transaction, after issuance costs was approximately $795.2 million. In addition, we have a revolving secured credit facility that matures in November 2020. To date, no funds have been drawn under the credit facility, with $375.0 millionremaining available. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at our option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. This margin is determined based on our total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. We are obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an annual administrative agent fee of $0.1 millionand an unused commitment fee of 0.15%.See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these transactions.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, including any expenditures related to strategic transactions and investment commitments that we may from time to time enter into, and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, and debt financing arrangements. We cannot provide assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.Short-term restricted cash of $33.2 millionas of September30, 2018reflects pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process our sellers' payments transactions and as collateral pursuant to an agreement with the originating bank for the Company's loan product. We use the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with these financial institutions to provide collateral for liabilities arising from cash flow timing differences in the processing of these payments. We have recorded this amount as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets given the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted. Additionally, this balance includes certain amounts held as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements, discussed in the paragraph below, which we expect to become unrestricted within the next year.Long-term restricted cash of $10.1 millionas of September30, 2018is primarily related to cash deposited into money market funds that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements. The Company has recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets as the lease terms extend beyond one year. We experience significant day-to-day fluctuations in our cash and cash equivalents due to fluctuations in settlements receivable and customers payable, and hence working capital. These fluctuations are primarily due to:Timing of period end.For periods that end on a weekend or a bank holiday, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable amounts typically will be more than for periods ending on a weekday, as we settle to our sellers for payment processing activity on business days; andFluctuations in daily GPV.When daily GPV increases, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable amounts increase. Typically our settlements receivable and customers payable balances at period end represent one to four days of receivables and disbursements to be made in the subsequent period.Customers payable and settlements receivable balances typically move in tandem, as pay-out and pay-in largely occur on the same business day. However, customers payable balances will be greater in amount than settlements receivable balances due to the 47fact that a subset of funds are held due to unlinked bank accounts, risk holds, and chargebacks. Holidays and day-of-week may also cause significant volatility in daily GPV amounts.Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest and other expense, share-based compensation expense, transaction, loan and advance losses, deferred income taxes, and the cumulative adjustment for adoption of ASC 606, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital.For the ninemonths ended September30, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $118.7 million, primarily as a result of: Net loss of $10.2 millionless non-cash gain on revaluation of equity investment of $36.9 million, offset by add back of non-cash items consisting primarily of share-based compensation of $157.9 million, transaction, loan and advance losses of $63.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $38.3 million, and non-cash items of $23.6 million. While the gain on revaluation of the equity investment is as result of the initial public offering of Eventbrite and subsequent mark to market valuation of this investment. The other items are largely driven by growth and expansion of our business activities.Additional cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities, including increases in customers payable of $581.5 million, settlements payable of $88.5 million, accrued expenses of $31.0 million, and other current liabilities of $27.2 million. Both customers payable and settlements payable balances increased significantly compared to as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to the increase in GPV at the end of the period. These balances are largely offset by settlements receivable, described below, which moves in tandem. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to increase in advertising and other marketing expenses. Other current liabilities increased primarily due to increase in payables associated with Square Capital and Square Payroll.Offset in part by cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities, including increases in settlements receivable of $579.8 millionfor reasons aforementioned, increases in customer funds of $156.2 millionas result of an increasing customer base with stored funds on the Cash App, increases in other current assets of $50.1 million, charge-offs to accrued transaction losses of $40.4 millionarising as a result of growth in GPV.For the ninemonths ended September30, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $130.3 million, primarily as a result of:Net loss of $47.2 million, offset by non-cash items consisting primarily of share-based compensation of $111.3 million, provision for transaction losses of $50.2 million, and depreciation and amortization of $27.6 million.Additional cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities, including increases in customer payable of $295.4 million, increases in settlements payable of $30.3 millionand increases in accrued expenses of $20.3 million. Offset in part by cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities, including increases in settlements receivable of $271.2 million, increases in customer funds of $41.9 million, charge-offs to accrued transaction losses of $33.1 million, and due to the net activity related to loans held for sale of $22.3 million.Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth, investments in marketable debt securities, and business acquisitions.For the ninemonths ended September30, 2018, cash used in investing activities was $775.3 million, primarily as a result of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $112.4 millionand the purchase of marketable debt securities of $859.1 million, offset in part by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities of $235.0 million. Additional uses of cash were as a result of the purchase of property and equipment of $37.2 million.48For the ninemonths ended September30, 2017, cash used in investing activities was $360.5 millionprimarily as a result of the purchase of marketable debt securities of $485.5 million, offset in part by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities of $171.2 million. Additional uses of cash were as a result of the purchase of an equity investment of $25.0 millionfor preferred shares of Eventbrite, and the purchase of property and equipment of $19.6 million.Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the ninemonths ended September30, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $690.7 millionas a result of $795.2 millionin net proceeds from the 2023 Notes offering offset in part by the cash payment of $70.0 millionof principal of certain 2022 Notes upon conversion, and as a result of proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under our employee share purchase plan of $94.8 million, offset by payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $125.9 million. For the ninemonths ended September30, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $431.1 millionas a result of $393.4 millionin net proceeds from the 2022 Notes offering and as a result of proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options of $111.9 million, offset in part by the settlement of the warrant with Starbucks of $54.8 millionand payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $18.3 million. Contractual Obligations and Commitments OnMay25, 2018, we issued$862.5 millionin aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes that mature onMay15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction. There were no other material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, except for scheduled payments from the ongoing business, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember31, 2017.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented.49Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated future trends, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because these accounting policies require significant judgment, our actual results may differ materially from our estimates.We believe accounting policies and the assumptions and estimates associated with accrued transaction losses and revenue recognition have the greatest potential effect on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Except for the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,as discussed further in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, our critical accounting policies have not materially changed during theninemonths endedSeptember30, 2018.Revenue RecognitionApplication of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP requires that we make judgments and estimates related to the classification, measurement and recognition of revenue. Complex arrangements may require significant judgment in contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, under ASC 606, the determination of whether we are a principal in the delivery of managed payments solutions and sale of bitcoin, and therefore recognize the revenue on a gross basis, or we are an agent and therefore recognize revenue on a net basis can require considerable judgment. We have concluded that we are the principal in these arrangements because we control the services or product before delivery to the customers, and have the unilateral ability to accept or reject a transaction based on criteria we have established. Other Estimates As disclosed in Note 18 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, depending on the outcome of the classification of our primary business activity, we could be obligated to pay additional San Francisco Gross Receipts Tax together with associated penalties and interest, that in the aggregate could be material to our financial statements. Additionally, on November 6, 2018, residents of the City and County of San Francisco voted on a ballot measure that could require further taxes on gross receipts, starting on January 1, 2019. If applicable to our business, the impact of this measure could further increase our tax exposure.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements described in Note 1of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe have operations both within the United States and globally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below.Interest Rate SensitivityOur cash and cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities as of September30, 2018, were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of a majority of these instruments. Additionally, we have the ability to hold these instruments until maturity if necessary to reduce our risk. Any future borrowings incurred under our credit facility would 50accrue interest at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence (as described above). A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.Foreign Currency RiskMost of our revenue is earned in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our foreign operations are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Euro and British Pound. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial results.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.51Part IIOther InformationItem 1. Legal ProceedingsWe are currently a party to, and may in the future be involved in, various litigation matters (including intellectual property litigation), legal claims, government investigations, and other disputes. On May 14, 2018, Joshua Woodle, on behalf of a class of couriers who have delivered with Caviar in California, filed a lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court against Square, Inc. doing business as Caviar, which alleges that Caviar misclassified Mr. Woodle and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors and, in doing so, violated various provisions of the California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. The Court compelled arbitration of Mr. Woodles arbitrable claims on November 5, 2018. On August 24, 2018, Mervyn Cole, on behalf of the State of California and similarly situated couriers who have delivered with Caviar in California filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Square, Inc. doing business as Caviar. The complaint alleges that Caviar misclassified Mr. Cole and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors and, in doing so, violated certain provisions of the California Labor Code. The action is being brought as a representative action under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). Plaintiffs seek civil penalties and injunctive relief. Given the early stage of these proceedings, it is not yet possible to reliably determine any potential liability that could result from these matters. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other litigation matters and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business.We cannot at this time fairly estimate a reasonable range of exposure, if any, of the potential liability with respect to these other matters. While we do not believe, at this time, that any ultimate liability resulting from any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, we cannot give any assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of these other matters, and their resolution could be material to our operating results for any particular period.Item 1A. Risk FactorsInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our ClassA common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Companys business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 under the heading Risk Factors.Risks Related to Our Business and Our IndustryOur business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand would hurt our business.We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our brand is predicated on the idea that our customers will trust us and find value in building and growing their businesses with our products and services. We believe that maintaining and promoting our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and expanding our base of customers. Maintaining and promoting our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure and innovative products and services, as well as our ability to maintain trust and be a technology leader. We may introduce, or make changes to, features, products, services, or terms of service that customers do not like, which may materially and adversely affect our brand. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business could be materially and adversely affected.52The introduction and promotion of new services, as well as the promotion of existing services, may be partly dependent on our visibility on third-party advertising platforms, such as Google, Twitter, or Facebook. Changes in the way these platforms operate or changes in their advertising prices or other terms could make the maintenance and promotion of our products and services and our brand more expensive or more difficult. If we are unable to market and promote our brand on third-party platforms effectively, our ability to acquire new customers would be materially harmed. We also use retail partners to sell hardware and acquire customers. Our ability to acquire new customers could be materially harmed if we are unable to enter into or maintain these partnerships on terms that are commercially reasonable to us, or at all.Harm to our brand can arise from many sources, including failure by us or our partners and service providers to satisfy expectations of service and quality; inadequate protection of sensitive information; compliance failures and claims; litigation and other claims; employee misconduct; and misconduct by our partners, service providers, or other counterparties. We have also received a significant amount of media coverage since our formation. We have also been from time to time in the past, and may in the future be, the target of incomplete, inaccurate, and misleading or false statements about our company, our business, and our products and services that could damage our brand and deter people and enterprises from adopting our services.Any negative publicity about our industry or our company, the quality and reliability of our products and services, our risk management processes, changes to our products and services, our ability to effectively manage and resolve customer complaints, our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, litigation, regulatory activity, policy positions, and the experience of our customers with our products or services, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in and use of our products and services. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand, our business could be materially and adversely affected.As our revenue has increased, our growth rate has slowed at times in the past and may decline in the future. Future revenue growth depends on our ability to retain existing sellers, attract new sellers, and increase sales to both new and existing sellers.Our total net revenue grew from $1,267.1 million in 2015 to $1,708.7 million in 2016 and to $2,214.3 million in 2017. Comparing the nine months endedSeptember30, 2017and 2018, our total net revenue grew from $1,598.2 millionto $2,365.6 million, respectively. Our rate of revenue growth has slowed at times in the past, and may decline in the future, and it may decline more quickly than we expect for a variety of reasons, including the risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our customers have no obligation to continue to use our services, and we cannot assure you that they will. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our sellers, and the difficulty and costs associated with switching to a competitor may not be significant for many of our services. Our sellers payment processing activity with us may decrease for a variety of reasons, including sellers level of satisfaction with our products and services, the effectiveness of our support services, our pricing, the pricing and quality of competing products or services, the effects of global economic conditions, or reductions in our sellers customer spending levels. In addition, the growth of our business depends in part on existing sellers expanding their use of our products and services. If we are unable to encourage sellers to broaden their use of our services, our growth may slow or stop, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. The growth of our business also depends on our ability to attract new sellers, to encourage larger sellers to use our products and services, and to introduce successful new products and services. We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our Square platform in order to offer better or new features, products and services, but if those features, products and services fail to be successful, our growth may slow or decline.Our business has generated net losses, and we intend to continue to invest substantially in our business. Thus, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We generated net losses of $62.8 million, $171.6 million, and $212.0 million for the years ended December31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the nine months endedSeptember30, 2018and 2017, we generated net losses of $10.2 millionand $47.2 million, respectively.As of September30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $857.6 million. We intend to continue to make significant investments in our business, including with respect to our employee base; sales and marketing, including expenses relating to increased direct marketing efforts, referral programs, and free hardware and subsidized services; development of new products, services, and features; acquisitions; expansion of office space and other infrastructure; expansion of international operations; and general administration, including legal, finance, and other compliance expenses related to being a public company. If the costs associated with acquiring and supporting new or larger sellers materially rise in the future, including the fees we pay to third parties to advertise our products and services, our expenses may rise significantly. In addition, increases in our seller base could cause us to incur increased losses because costs associated with new sellers are generally incurred up front, while revenue is recognized thereafter as our products and services are transferred to our sellers. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.53From time to time, we may make decisions that will have a negative effect on our short-term operating results if we believe those decisions will improve the experiences of our customers, which we believe will improve our operating results over the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the expectations of investors and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business may be materially and adversely affected.We, our sellers, our partners, and others who use our services obtain and process a large amount of sensitive data. Any real or perceived improper or unauthorized use of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation as a trusted brand, as well as have a material and adverse effect on our business.We, our sellers, and our partners, including third-party vendors and data centers that we use, obtain and process large amounts of sensitive data, including data related to our sellers, their customers, and their transactions, as well as other users of our services, such as Cash App and Square Payroll. We face risks, including to our reputation as a trusted brand, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business continues to expand to include new products and technologies. Our operations involve the storage and transmission of sensitive information of individuals using our services, including their names, addresses, social security numbers (or their foreign equivalents), payment card numbers and expiration dates, bank account information, and data regarding the performance of our sellers businesses. We also obtain sensitive information, including those regarding our sellers customers, Weebly customers, Cash App customers, Square Capital customers, and Caviar diners, couriers and restaurants, including their contact information, payment card numbers and expiration dates, and purchase histories. Additionally, certain of our products and services are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (and the rules and regulations thereunder, as amended, including with respect to the HITECH Act) (HIPAA), and therefore we are required to take measures to safeguard protected health information of our sellers and their customers. Our services also provide third party developers the opportunity to provide applications to our sellers in the Square and Weebly app marketplaces. Sellers who choose to use such applications can grant permission allowing the applications to access content created or held by sellers in their Square or Weebly account. Should such third party developers experience or cause a breach, or should a technological bug inadvertently expose non-permissioned personal information to such developers, that could lead to a compromise of the content of data held by such sellers, including personal data.We have administrative, technical, and physical security measures in place, and we have policies and procedures in place to contractually require third parties to whom we transfer data to implement and maintain appropriate privacy and security measures. However, if our privacy and security measures or those of the previously mentioned third parties are inadequate or are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, trickery, process failure or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to or exfiltrates funds, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, or sensitive information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, on our systems or our partners systems, or if we suffer a ransomware or advanced persistent threat attack, or if any of the foregoing is reported or perceived to have occurred, our reputation and business could be damaged. If the sensitive information is lost or improperly disclosed or threatened to be disclosed, we could incur significant liability, financial loss, and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and penalties, including costs associated with remediation. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our sellers or other third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. Additionally, if our own confidential business information were improperly disclosed, our business could be materially and adversely affected. A core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our payments platform. Any perceived or actual breach of security, regardless of how it occurs or the extent of the breach, could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing sellers or other customers, prevent us from obtaining new sellers and other customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to implement measures to prevent further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability including those resulting from governmental or regulatory investigations, class action litigation and costs associated with remediation, such as fraud monitoring and forensics. Any actual or perceived security breach at a company providing services to us or our customers could have similar effects. Further, any actual or perceived security breach with respect to the bitcoin and blockchain ledger, regardless of whether such breach directly affects our products and services, could have negative reputational effects and harm customer trust in us and our products and services. 54Our risk management efforts may not be effective, which could expose us to losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.We offer managed payments and other products and services to a large number of customers, and we are responsible for vetting and monitoring these customers and determining whether the transactions we process for them are legitimate. When our products and services are used to process illegitimate transactions, and we settle those funds to sellers and are unable to recover them, we suffer losses and liability. These types of illegitimate transactions can also expose us to governmental and regulatory sanctions as well as potentially prevent us from satisfying our contractual obligations to our third party partners, which may cause us to be in breach of our obligations. The highly automated nature of, and liquidity offered by, our payments services make us a target for illegal or improper uses, including fraudulent or illegal sales of goods or services, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen or fabricated credit card or bank account numbers, or other deceptive or malicious practices, potentially can steal significant amounts of money from businesses like ours. In configuring our payments services, we face an inherent trade-off between security and customer convenience. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. As a greater number of larger sellers use our services, our exposure to material risk losses from a single seller, or from a small number of sellers, will increase. Our current business and anticipated domestic and international growth will continue to place significant demands on our risk management and compliance efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management infrastructure, techniques, and processes. In addition, when we introduce new services, expand existing services, including online payment acceptance, focus on new business areas, including consumer financing and installment loans, or begin to operate in markets where we have a limited history of fraud loss, we may be less able to forecast and carry appropriate reserves in our books for those losses. Furthermore, if our risk management policies and processes contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, we may suffer large financial losses, we may be subject to civil and criminal liability, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.We are currently, and will continue to be, exposed to risks associated with chargebacks and refunds in connection with payment card fraud or relating to the goods or services provided by our sellers. In the event that a billing dispute between a cardholder and a seller is not resolved in favor of the seller, including in situations where the seller engaged in fraud, the transaction is typically charged back to the seller and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If we are unable to collect chargebacks or refunds from the sellers account, or if the seller refuses to or is unable to reimburse us for chargebacks or refunds due to closure, bankruptcy, or other reasons, we may bear the loss for the amounts paid to the cardholder. Since October 2015, businesses that cannot process EMV chip cards are held financially responsible for certain fraudulent transactions conducted using chip-enabled cards. This has shifted an increased amount of the risk for certain fraudulent transactions from the issuing banks to these sellers, which has resulted in our having to seek an increased level of reimbursement for chargebacks from our sellers that do not deploy EMV-compliant card readers. Not all of the readers we offer to merchants are EMV-compliant. Our financial results would be adversely affected to the extent sellers do not fully reimburse us for the related chargebacks. We do not collect and maintain reserves from our sellers to cover these potential losses, and for customer relations purposes we sometimes decline to seek reimbursement for certain chargebacks. The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those of our sellers that promise future delivery of goods and services, which we allow on our Square platform. If we are unable to maintain our losses from chargebacks at acceptable levels, the payment card networks could fine us, increase our transaction-based fees, or terminate our ability to process payment cards. Any increase in our transaction-based fees could damage our business, and if we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenue from managed payments services. Our efforts to expand our product portfolio and market reach may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth.We derive a significant portion of our revenue from transaction-based fees we collect in connection with managed payments services. While we intend to continue to broaden the scope of products and services we offer, we may not be successful in deriving any significant revenue from these products and services. Failure to broaden the scope of products and services that are attractive may inhibit the growth of repeat business and harm our business, as well as increase the vulnerability of our core payments business to competitors offering a full suite of products and services. Furthermore, we may have limited or no experience in our newer markets. For example, we cannot assure you that any of our products or services will be widely accepted or that they will continue to grow in revenue. Our offerings may present new and difficult technological, operational, regulatory and other challenges, and if we experience service disruptions, failures, or other issues, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Our newer activities may not recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and materially and adversely affect our business.55Our success depends on our ability to develop products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for payments and point-of-sale, financial, and marketing services, and, if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and evolve. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in omnichannel commerce, proximity payment devices (including contactless payments via NFC technology), as well as developments in cryptocurrencies and in tokenization, which replaces sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) with symbols (tokens) to keep the data safe in the event that it ends up in the wrong hands. These new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and offer to our customers will achieve significant commercial acceptance. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payment card networks, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our customers, which includes our sellers and their buyers, or third parties intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.The success of enhancements, new features, and products and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the enhancements or new features, products or services. We often rely not only on our own initiatives and innovations, but also on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies and development of a robust market for these new products and technologies. Failure to accurately predict or to respond effectively to developments in our industry may significantly impair our business.In addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, infrastructures, and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in mobile, software, communication, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.Substantial and increasingly intense competition in our industry may harm our business.We compete in markets characterized by vigorous competition, changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new services or enhance existing services. We compete against many companies to attract customers, and some of these companies have greater financial resources and substantially larger bases of customers than we do, which may provide them with significant competitive advantages. These companies may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative products and services that adversely impact our growth. Mergers and acquisitions by these companies may lead to even larger competitors with more resources. We also expect new entrants to offer competitive products and services. Certain sellers have long-standing exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to accept payment cards and other services that we offer. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them. Competing services tied to established brands may engender greater confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services. If we are unable to differentiate ourselves from and successfully compete with our competitors, our business will be materially and adversely affected.We may also face pricing pressures from competitors. Some potential competitors are able to offer lower prices to sellers for similar services by cross-subsidizing their payments services through other services they offer. Such competition may result in the need for us to alter the pricing we offer to our sellers and could reduce our gross profit. In addition, as we grow, sellers may demand more customized and favorable pricing from us, and competitive pressures may require us to agree to such pricing, further reducing our gross profit. We currently negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large sellers to increase acceptance and usage of our products and services. If we continue this practice and if an increasing proportion of our sellers are large sellers, we may have to increase the discounts or incentives we provide, which could also reduce our gross profit.56We are dependent on payment card networks and acquiring processors, and any changes to their rules or practices could harm our business.Our business depends on our ability to accept credit and debit cards, and this ability is provided by the payment card networks, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. In a majority of these cases, we do not directly access the payment card networks that enable our acceptance of payment cards. As a result, we must rely on banks and acquiring processors to process transactions on our behalf. Our acquiring processor agreements have terms ranging from two to six years. Our three largest such agreements expire between the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2022. These banks and acquiring processors may fail or refuse to process transactions adequately, may breach their agreements with us, or may refuse to renegotiate or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms. They might also take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services, including their own services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing, renegotiating or maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with these payment card networks, banks, and acquiring processors, our business may be harmed.The payment card networks and our acquiring processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules that apply to us as a payment facilitator providing payment processing services to merchants. The payment card networks set these network rules and have discretion to interpret the rules and change them at any time. Any changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we or our acquiring processors currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement. If we fail to make such changes or otherwise resolve the issue with the payment card networks, the networks could fine us or prohibit us from processing payment cards. In addition, violations of the network rules or any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. If we were unable to accept payment cards or were limited in our ability to do so, our business would be materially and adversely affected.We are required to pay interchange and assessment fees, processing fees and bank settlement fees to third-party payment processors and financial institutions. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction processed using their networks. In addition, our acquiring processors and payment card networks may refuse to renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Interchange fees or assessments are also subject to change from time to time due to government regulation. Because we generally charge our sellers a flat rate for our managed payments services, rather than passing through interchange fees and assessments to our sellers directly, any increase or decrease in interchange fees or assessments or in the fees we pay to our acquiring processors could make our pricing look less competitive, lead us to change our pricing model, or adversely affect our margins.We could be, and in the past have been, subject to penalties from payment card networks if we fail to detect that sellers are engaging in activities that are illegal, contrary to the payment card network operating rules, or considered high risk. We must either prevent high-risk sellers from using our products and services or register such sellers with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such sellers. Although the amount of these penalties has not been material to date, any additional penalties in the future could become material and could result in termination of our ability to accept payment cards or could require changes in our process for registering new sellers. This could materially and adversely affect our business.Our quarterly results of operations and operating metrics fluctuate significantly and are unpredictable and subject to seasonality, which could result in the trading price of our Class A common stock being unpredictable or declining.Our quarterly results of operations have historically fluctuated significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Our limited operating history combined with the rapidly evolving markets in which we operate also contributes to these fluctuations. Fluctuations in quarterly results may materially and adversely affect the predictability of our business and the price of our Class A common stock.Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include our ability to attract and retain new customers; seasonality in our business or our sellers' business, including seasonal fluctuations in the amount of transactions our sellers are processing; the timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure, as well as the success of those expansions and upgrades; the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims; our ability to maintain or increase revenue, gross margins, and operating margins; our ability to continue introducing new products and services and to continue convincing customers to adopt additional offerings; increases in and timing of expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive, including strategic transactions and related transaction and integration costs; period-to-period volatility 57related to fraud and risk losses; system failures resulting in the inaccessibility of our products and services; changes in the regulatory environment, including with respect to security, privacy, data protection or enforcement of laws and regulations by regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees; changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions; unusual weather conditions or natural disasters; general retail buying patterns; and the other risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, from time to time we make investments in equity that is, or may become, publicly held. We may experience volatility due to changes in the market prices of such equity investments, which may be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline.We depend on key management, as well as our experienced and capable employees, and any failure to attract, motivate, and retain our employees could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business.Our future success is significantly dependent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees. If we lose the services of any member of management or any key personnel, we may not be able to locate a suitable or qualified replacement, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train a replacement, which could severely disrupt our business and growth. Jack Dorsey, our co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Inc. This may at times adversely affect his ability to devote time, attention, and effort to Square.To maintain and grow our business, we will need to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees. Identifying, recruiting, training, integrating, and retaining qualified individuals requires significant time, expense, and attention. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our management team, including any new hires that we make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Additionally, potential changes in U.S. immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting. Negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of these potential changes may also adversely affect our international recruiting efforts. Furthermore, our international expansion and our business in general may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our hiring processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. If we are not able to add and retain employees effectively, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, and our business and growth prospects will be harmed.If we do not continue to improve our operational, financial and other internal controls and systems to manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed.Our current business and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources. In order to manage our growth effectively, we must continue to strengthen our existing infrastructure and operational procedures, enhance our internal controls and reporting systems, and ensure we timely and accurately address issues as they arise. In particular, our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in:improving and implementing existing and developing new internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our operational, financial, communications and other internal systems and procedures;installing enhanced management information and control systems; andpreserving our core values, strategies, and goals and effectively communicating these to our employees worldwide.If we are not successful in developing and implementing the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. These efforts may require substantial financial expenditures, commitments of resources, developments of our processes, and other investments and innovations. As we grow, we must balance the need for additional controls and systems with the ability to efficiently develop and launch new features for our products and services. However, it is likely that as we grow, we will not be able to launch new features, or respond to customer or market demands as quickly as a smaller, more efficient organization. If we do not successfully manage our growth, our business will suffer.A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.58Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by businesses and their customers. Most of the sellers that use our services are small businesses, many of which are in the early stages of their development, and these businesses may be disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses. If spending by their customers declines, these businesses would experience reduced sales and process fewer payments with us or, if they cease to operate, stop using our products and services altogether. Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services. For example, if sellers processing payments with us receive chargebacks after they cease to operate, we may incur additional losses. Additionally, the growth in the number of sellers qualifying for participation in the Square Capital program may slow, or business loans may be paid more slowly, or not at all. In addition, as we expand our business to offer consumer financing products, those customers may also be disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns. Further, our suppliers, distributors and other third party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges. Such suppliers and third parties may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet end customer demands or collect revenue or otherwise could harm our business. Furthermore, our investment portfolio, which includes U.S. government and corporate securities, is subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by certain events that affect the global financial markets. If global credit and equity markets decline for extended periods, or if there is a downgrade of the securities within our portfolio, the investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.We are also monitoring developments related to the decision by the U.K. government to leave the European Union (EU) following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the EU (often referred to as "Brexit"), which could have significant implications for our business. In March 2017, the United Kingdom began the official process to leave the EU by April 2019. Brexit could lead to economic and legal uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and increasingly divergent laws, regulations and licensing requirements for the Company as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Expanding our business globally could subject us to new challenges and risks. We currently offer our services and products in multiple countries and plan to continue expanding our business further globally. Expansion, whether in our existing or new global markets, will require additional resources and controls, and offering our services in new geographic regions often requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time. We may not be successful enough in these new geographies to recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all. Such expansion could also subject our business to substantial risks, including:difficulty in attracting a sufficient number of sellers;failure to anticipate competitive conditions;conformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;increased costs and difficulty in protecting intellectual property and sensitive data;changes to the way we do business as compared with our current operations or a lack of acceptance of our products and services;the ability to support and integrate with local third-party service providers;competition with service providers or other entrenched market-players that have greater experience in the local markets than we do;difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws and customs, challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with global operations;difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture;59difficulty in gaining acceptance from industry self-regulatory bodies;compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including with respect to payments, data privacy, data protection and information security;compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws;potential tariffs, sanctions, fines or other trade restrictions;exchange rate risk;compliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and applicable U.S. tax laws, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws; andregional economic and political instability.As a result of these risks, our efforts to expand our global operations may not be successful, which could limit our ability to grow our business.Any acquisitions, strategic investments, entries into new businesses, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations or result in operating difficulties and liabilities, harm our business and negatively impact our results of operations.In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions and evaluate opportunities for possible acquisitions, strategic investments, entries into new businesses, divestitures, and other transactions. We have in the past acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire or invest in businesses, apps, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisitions or divestitures may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. We also have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. In addition to transaction and opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, whether or not such transactions are completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively impact our results of operations, including risks that:the transaction may not advance our business strategy;we may spend time and resources on opportunities that we are unable to consummate on terms acceptable to us;the transaction may not close or may be delayed;we may not be able to secure required regulatory approvals or otherwise satisfy closing conditions for a proposed transaction in a timely manner, or at all;we may not realize a satisfactory return or increase our revenue;we may experience difficulty, and may not be successful in, integrating technologies, IT systems, data processing methods and policies, accounting systems, culture, or personnel of the acquired business and we may not realize the expected synergies of the transaction in a timely manner, or at all;we may incur significant acquisition costs and transition costs;we may experience disruptions in our ongoing operations that divert managements attention;we may not realize the expected benefits from the transaction in the expected time period, or at all;we may be unable to retain key personnel;acquired businesses or businesses in which we invest may not have adequate controls, processes and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;60we may incur substantial liabilities associated with the activities or conduct of the acquired business before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, and other liabilities, whether known or unknown;we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings, or other circumstances prior to acquiring or investing in a business, which could result in additional financial, legal, or regulatory exposure, which may subject us to additional controls, policies, procedures, liabilities, costs of compliance or remediation, or other adverse effects on our business, operating results, or financial condition;we may have difficulty entering new market segments;we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses;there may be unknown, underestimated, or undisclosed commitments or liabilities, including actual or threatened litigation;there may be regulatory constraints, including competition regulations that may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments; there may be local and foreign regulations applicable to the international activities of our business and the businesses we acquire;acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt; andour business, the acquired business, or the integrated business may be adversely affected by other political, business, and general economic conditions.We may also choose to divest certain businesses or product lines that no longer fit with our strategic objectives. If we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we may experience difficulty separating out portions of or entire businesses, incur potential loss of revenue or experience negative impact on margins. Such potential transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur additional expenses, potentially disrupt seller relationships, and expose us to unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities.We rely on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including the processing of transaction data and settlement of funds to us and our sellers, and these third parties failure to perform these services adequately could materially and adversely affect our business.To provide our managed payments solution and other products and services, we rely on third parties that we do not control, such as the payment card networks, our acquiring processors, the payment card issuers, various financial institution partners (including those for Square Capital and Cash App), systems like the Federal Reserve Automated Clearing House, and other partners. We rely on these third parties for a variety of services, including the transmission of transaction data, processing of chargebacks and refunds, settlement of funds to our sellers, and the provision of information and other elements of our services. For example, we currently rely on three acquiring processors in the United States, Canada and Japan and two for each of Australia and the United Kingdom. While we believe there are other acquiring processors that could meet our needs, adding or transitioning to new providers may significantly disrupt our business and increase our costs. In the event these third parties fail to provide these services adequately, including as a result of financial difficulty or insolvency, errors in their systems or events beyond their control, or refuse to provide these services on terms acceptable to us or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, our business may be materially and adversely affected.In addition, we use third-party technology and systems for a variety of our day-to-day business operations. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.Our services must integrate with a variety of operating systems, and the hardware that enables merchants to accept payment cards must interoperate with third-party mobile devices utilizing those operating systems. If we are unable to ensure that our services or hardware interoperate with such operating systems and devices, our business may be materially and adversely affected.61We are dependent on the ability of our products and services to integrate with a variety of operating systems, as well as web browsers that we do not control. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our products and services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services, including their own services, could materially and adversely affect usage of our products and services. In addition, we rely on app marketplaces, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, to drive downloads of our mobile app and our Cash App. Apple, Google, or other operators of app marketplaces regularly make changes to their marketplaces, and those changes may make access to our products and services more difficult. In the event that it is difficult for our customers to access and use our products and services, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, Apple, Google, or other operators of app marketplaces regularly provide software updates, and such software updates may not operate effectively with our products and services, which may reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction by our customers, and may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, our hardware interoperates with wired and wireless interfaces to mobile devices developed by third parties. For example, the current versions of our magstripe reader plug into an audio jack or a Lightning connector. The use of these connection types could change, and such changes and other potential changes in the design of future mobile devices could limit the interoperability of our hardware and software with such devices and require modifications to our hardware or software. If we are unable to ensure that our hardware and software continue to interoperate effectively with such devices, if doing so is costly, or if existing merchants decide not to utilize additional parts necessary for interoperability, our business may be materially and adversely affected.Many of our key components are procured from a single or limited number of suppliers. Thus, we are at risk of shortage, price increases, changes, delay, or discontinuation of key components, which could disrupt and materially and adversely affect our business.Many of the key components used to manufacture our products, such as the custom parts of our magstripe reader, including its magnetic stripe-reading element, its plastic cover, and its application-specific integrated circuits, come from limited or single sources of supply, as do the plastic cover, connector, and security cage of our contactless and chip reader. In addition, in some cases, we rely only on one manufacturer to fabricate, test, and assemble our products. For example, a single manufacturer assembles our magstripe reader and our contactless and chip reader, as well as manufactures those products plastic parts with custom tools that we own but that they maintain on their premises. The term of the agreement with that manufacturer automatically renews for consecutive one-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. In general, our contract manufacturers fabricate or procure components on our behalf, subject to certain approved procedures or supplier lists, and we do not have firm commitments from all of these manufacturers to provide all components, or to provide them in quantities and on timelines that we may require. For example, pursuant to a development and supply agreement, a component supplier provides design, development, customization, and related services for components of the magnetic stripe-reading element in some of our products. The term of the agreement renews for successive two-year terms unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. Similarly, a component provider develops certain application-specific integrated circuits for our products pursuant to our designs and specifications. The term of our agreement with this provider renews for consecutive one-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. Due to our reliance on the components or products produced by suppliers such as these, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of certain components or products. We are still in the process of identifying alternative manufacturers for the assembly of our products and for most of the single-sourced components used in our products. In the case of off-the-shelf components, we are subject to the risk that our suppliers may discontinue or modify them, or that the components may cease to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, component shortages or delays or other problems in product assembly, and the availability of these components or products may be difficult to predict. For example, our manufacturers may experience temporary or permanent disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cost increases, acquisitions, insolvency, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or other similar problems. Additionally, various sources of supply-chain risk, including strikes or shutdowns at delivery ports or loss of or damage to our products while they are in transit or storage, intellectual property theft, losses due to tampering, third-party vendor issues with quality or sourcing control, failure by our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulation, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, or other similar problems could limit or delay the supply of our products or harm our reputation. In the event of a shortage or supply interruption from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources quickly, cost-effectively, or at all. Any interruption or delay in manufacturing, component supply, any increases in component costs, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to provide our products to sellers on a timely basis. This could harm our relationships with our sellers, prevent us from acquiring new sellers, and materially and adversely affect our business.62The United States recently imposed tariffs on certain imports from China, including on some of our hardware devices manufactured in China. If the U.S. administration imposes additional tariffs, our other hardware devices produced in China could also be impacted. While it is too early to predict how the recently enacted, proposed, and any future tariffs on items imported from China or elsewhere will impact our business, such tariffs would negatively impact our gross margin on the impacted products. Moreover, any increase in pricing as a result of such tariffs could reduce the competitiveness of our products. The impact of any increased or new tariffs or other trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of future operations. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products and to adequately manage our product inventory.We invest broadly in our business, and such investments are driven by our expectations of the future success of a product. For example, our products such as the Square Reader often require investments with long lead times. An inability to correctly forecast the success of a particular product could harm our business. We must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in demand for our products or for our competitors products, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and a change in economic conditions.If we underestimate demand for a particular product, our contract manufacturers and suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of that product to meet our requirements, and we may experience a shortage of that product available for sale or distribution. The shortage of a popular product could materially and adversely affect our brand, our seller relationships, and the acquisition of additional sellers. If we overestimate demand for a particular product, we may experience excess inventory levels for that product and the excess inventory may become obsolete or out-of-date. Inventory levels in excess of demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at further discounted prices, which could negatively impact our gross profit and our business.Our products and services may not function as intended due to errors in our software, hardware, and systems, product defects, or due to security breaches or human error in administering these systems, which could materially and adversely affect our business.Our software, hardware, and systems may contain undetected errors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly to the extent such errors are not detected and remedied quickly. We have from time to time found defects in our customer-facing software and hardware, internal systems, and technical integrations with third-party systems, and new errors may be introduced in the future. If there are such errors or defects in our software, hardware or systems, we may face negative publicity, government investigations and litigation. Additionally, we rely on a limited number of component and product suppliers located outside of the U.S. to manufacture our products. As a result, our direct control over production and distribution is limited and it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality of our products.If there are defects in the manufacture of our hardware products, we may face similar negative publicity, investigations, and litigation, and we may not be fully compensated by our suppliers for any financial or other liability that we suffer as a result. As our hardware continues to increase in size and complexity, these risks may correspondingly increase as well.In addition, we provide frequent incremental releases of product and service updates and functional enhancements, which increase the possibility of errors. The products and services we provide are designed to process complex transactions and deliver reports and other information related to those transactions, all at high volumes and processing speeds. Any errors, defects, security breaches such as cyber-attacks or identity theft, malfeasance, disruptions in services, or other performance problems with our services could hurt our reputation and damage our customers businesses. Software and system errors, or human error, could delay or inhibit settlement of payments, result in oversettlement, cause reporting errors, or prevent us from collecting transaction-based fees, all of which have occurred in the past. Similarly, third-party security breaches such as cyber-attacks or identity theft could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products or services, cause errors, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers, and other destructive outcomes. Moreover, security breaches or errors in our hardware design or manufacture could cause product safety issues typical of consumer electronics devices. Such issues could lead to product recalls and inventory shortages, result in costly and time-consuming efforts to redesign and redistribute our products, give rise to regulatory inquiries and investigations, and result in lawsuits and other liabilities and losses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, electronic payment products and services, including ours, have been and could continue to be in the future, specifically targeted and penetrated or disrupted by hackers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, 63products and services, and disable, alter, degrade, or sabotage them, change frequently and may be difficult to detect or remediate for long periods of time, we and our customers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures to stop them, and our data encryption may be unable to prevent unauthorized use by hackers. If we or our sellers are unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks, our sellers' businesses may be harmed, our reputation could be damaged, and we could incur significant liability. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by these attacks.Systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our products or services, or those of our sellers, could harm our business and our brand, and subject us to substantial liability.Our systems and those of our third-party data center facilities may experience service interruptions, denial-of-service and other cyber-attacks and security incidents, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical unrest, computer viruses, changes in social, political or regulatory conditions or in laws and policies, or other changes or events. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster-recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans. This increased scrutiny may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and will likely continue to experience denial-of-service and other cyber-attacks, system failures, security incidents, and other events or conditions that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. In addition, they could result in significant expense to repair or replace damaged equipment and remedy resultant data loss or corruption. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our products or services could materially harm our reputation and business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our products and services could cause customers to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and business. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to customers or their businesses, these customers could seek compensation from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.A significant natural disaster could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Our headquarters and certain of our data center facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our headquarters or data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our services or could result in related liabilities. We have implemented a disaster recovery program, which enables us to move production to a back-up data center in the event of a catastrophe. Although this program is functional, it may prove to be inadequate, increasing the risk of interruptions in our services, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. We do not maintain insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that could result from disruptions to our services.Significant natural or other disasters could also have a material and adverse impact on our sellers, which, in the aggregate, could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.The loss or destruction of a private key required to access a bitcoin may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to the bitcoins we hold on behalf of customers, our customers may be unable to access their bitcoins and it could harm customer trust in us and our products.Bitcoins are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the bitcoins are held. While the bitcoin and blockchain ledger require a public key relating to a digital wallet to be published when used in a transaction, private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the bitcoins held in such wallet. To the extent our private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the bitcoins held in the related digital wallet. Further, we cannot provide assurance that our wallet will not be hacked or compromised. The bitcoin and blockchain ledger, as well as other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking, or other malicious activities. Any loss of private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our customers bitcoins could adversely affect our customers ability to access or sell their bitcoins and could harm customer trust in us and our products. Additionally, any loss of private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used by third parties to store bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies could have negative reputational effects on us and harm customer trust in us and our products. 64Square Capital is subject to additional risks relating to the availability of capital, seller payments, availability and structure of its bank partnership, expansion of its products, and general macroeconomic conditions.Square Capital, which includes our wholly owned subsidiary Square Capital, LLC, is subject to risks in addition to those described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Maintaining and growing Square Capital is dependent on institutional third-party investors purchasing the eligible business loans originated by our bank partner. If such third parties fail to continue to purchase such business loans or reduce the amount of future loans they purchase, then our bank partner may need to reduce originations, or we would need to fund the purchase of additional business loans from our own resources. We then may have to reduce the scale of Square Capital, which could have a direct impact on our ability to grow. Additionally, Square Capital has certain customary repurchase obligations in its loan purchase and servicing agreements with such institutional third party investors for breaches of certain eligibility representations and warranties. If third parties reduce the price they are willing to pay for these business loans or reduce the servicing fees they pay us in exchange for servicing the business loans on their behalf, then the financial performance of Square Capital would be harmed.The business loans are generally unsecured obligations of our Square sellers who utilize Square Capital, and they are not guaranteed or insured in any way. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans.In addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions could lead to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strain our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business loans. Similarly, if we fail to correctly predict the likelihood of timely repayment of the business loans or correctly price the business loans to sellers utilizing Square Capital, our business may be materially and adversely affected. As we expand our business to offer consumer financing products, those customers may also be adversely affected by economic downturns.We have partnered, on a non-exclusive basis, with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank to originate the business loans. Such bank may offer products that compete with ours. The bank is subject to oversight both by the FDIC and the State of Utah. Due to the fact that we are a service-provider to our bank partner, we are subject to audit standards for third-party vendors in accordance with FDIC guidance and examinations by the FDIC. There has been, and may continue to be, regulatory interest in and/or litigation challenging partnered lending arrangements where a bank makes loans and then sells and assigns such loans to a non-bank entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination and servicing of the loan. If our bank partner ceases to partner with us, ceases to abide by the terms of our agreement with them, or cannot partner with us on commercially reasonable terms, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives and/or make business loans ourselves pursuant to state licensing requirements, Square Capital may need to enter into a new partnership with another qualified financial institution, revert to the merchant cash advance (MCA) model, or pursue an alternative model for originating business loans, all of which may be time-consuming and costly and/or lead to a loss of institutional third-party investors willing to purchase such business loans or MCAs, and as a result Square Capital may be materially and adversely affected. We intend to continue to explore other products, models and structures for Square Capital, including partnering with referral partners, forming a Utah industrial loan corporation, offering consumer financing and other forms of credit and loan origination. Some of those models or structures may require, or be deemed to require, additional data, procedures, partnerships, licenses, regulatory approvals or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed. The licenses required in connection with the consumer lending program that we launched in 2017 and other activities related to the Square Capital program subject us to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by applicable state regulatory agencies. Should we fail to expand and evolve Square Capital in this manner, or should these new products, models or structures, or new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations, impose requirements on us that are impractical or that we cannot satisfy, the future growth and success of Square Capital may be materially and adversely affected.Our business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of areas, all of which are subject to change and uncertain interpretation.65We are subject to a wide variety of local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and industry standards in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern numerous areas that are important to our business, including, but not limited to, consumer protection, privacy, information security, fair lending, financial services, labor and employment, immigration, import and export practices, product labeling, competition, data protection, and marketing and communications practices. Such laws and regulations are subject to changes and evolving interpretations and application, including by means of legislative changes and/or executive orders, and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business and the way we conduct our operations, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. Any perceived or actual breach of laws and regulations could result in investigations, regulatory inquiries, litigation, fines, negative customer sentiment or otherwise negatively impact our business. It is possible that these laws and regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair our existing or planned products and services; that could cause us to be subject to audits, inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits; that could result in fines, injunctive relief, or other liabilities; or that could require costly, time-consuming, or otherwise burdensome compliance measures from us.In particular, as we seek to build a trusted and secure platform for commerce, and as we expand our network of customers and facilitate their transactions and interactions with one another or otherwise evolve our products and services, we will increasingly be subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, privacy, security, and transfer of information, including the personally identifiable information of our employees and customers. As with the other laws and regulations noted above, these laws and regulations may change or be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible they will be interpreted and applied in ways that will materially and adversely affect our business. For example, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in 2016 adopted a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, superseding previous EU data protection legislation, imposing more stringent data privacy and data protection requirements and providing greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual revenue or 20 million. In the United Kingdom, a Data Protection Bill that substantially implements the GDPR became law in May 2018. In June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which will become effective on January 1, 2020. CCPA imposes stringent data privacy and data protection requirements for the data of California residents, and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to $7,500 per violation. It is likely that further amendments will be proposed to this legislation in 2019, and it remains unclear how various provisions of CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Data privacy and security continues to be a rapidly evolving area, and further legislative activity may arise in other jurisdictions. In addition, U.S. and international laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with evolving mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, shifting consumer expectations or contractual obligations. We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in the U.S. imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Any failure, real or perceived, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations or with any regulatory requirements or orders, other local, state, federal, or international privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations could cause our customers to reduce their use of our products and services and could materially and adversely affect our business.Further, from time to time, we may leverage third parties to help conduct our businesses in the U.S. or abroad. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for any corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products and services and/or increase our cost of doing business. In addition, if our practices are not consistent or viewed as not consistent with legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we may become subject to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or 66civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is subject to complex and evolving regulations and oversight related to our provision of payments services and other financial services.The state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and licensing schemes that govern our business include or may in the future include those relating to banking, lending, deposit-taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, payments services (such as payment processing and settlement services), cryptocurrency, consumer financial protection, anti-money laundering, escheatment, international sanctions regimes, and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect cardholder data. These laws, rules, and regulations are enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States, including the Department of the Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and numerous state and local agencies. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, including those enforced by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry in Japan, those enforced by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, and those enforced by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom. As we expand into new jurisdictions, or expand our product offerings into existing jurisdictions, the number of foreign regulations and regulators governing our business will expand as well. If we pursue additional or alternative means of growing Square Capital, additional state and federal regulations would apply. Similarly, if we choose to offer Square Payroll in more jurisdictions, additional regulations, including tax rules, will apply. In addition, as our business and products continue to develop and expand, we may become subject to additional rules and regulations. We have introduced a feature to the Cash App that permits our customers to buy and sell bitcoin. Bitcoin is not considered legal tender or backed by any government, and it has experienced price volatility, technological glitches and various law enforcement and regulatory interventions. We do not believe that the bitcoin platform involves offering securities that are subject to the registration or other provisions of federal or state securities laws. We also do not believe the feature subjects us to regulation under the federal securities laws, including as a broker-dealer or an investment adviser, or registration under the federal commodities laws. However, the regulation of cryptocurrency and crypto platforms is still an evolving area and it is possible that a court or a federal or state regulator could disagree with one or more of these conclusions. If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. Further, we might not be able to continue operating the feature, at least in current form, and to the extent that the feature is viewed by the market as a valuable asset to Square, the price of our Class A common stock could decrease. Although we have a compliance program focused on the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business and we are continually investing more in this program, we may still be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs who may be acting as private attorneys general pursuant to various applicable federal, state and local laws, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include significant criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, increased licensure requirements, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, any perceived or actual breach of compliance by us with respect to applicable laws, rules, and regulations could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand and could cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to avert further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability.We have obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the United States and in the states where this is required. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies concerning those aspects of our business considered money transmission. Evaluation of our compliance efforts, as well as the questions of whether and to what extent our products and services are considered money transmission, are matters of regulatory interpretation and could change over time. In the past, we have been subject to fines and other penalties by regulatory authorities due to their interpretations and applications to our business of their respective state money transmission laws. In the future, as a result of the regulations applicable to our business, we could be subject to investigations and resulting liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other sanctions, and we could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of our business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to otherwise change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, 67and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.We are subject to risks related to litigation, including intellectual property claims, government investigations or inquiries, and regulatory matters or disputes.We may be, and have been, subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government or regulatory investigations, subpoenas, inquiries or audits, and other proceedings involving intellectual property, consumer protection, privacy, data protection, labor and employment, immigration, import and export practices, product labeling, competition, accessibility, securities, tax, marketing and communications practices, commercial disputes, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, and other matters. The number and significance of our legal disputes and inquiries have increased as we have grown larger, as our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and as our products and services have increased in complexity, and we expect that we will continue to face additional legal disputes as we continue to grow and expand.We receive significant media attention and, as a public company, have a higher profile, which could result in increased litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings. In addition, some of the laws and regulations affecting the internet, mobile commerce, payment processing, business financing, and employment did not anticipate businesses like ours, and many of the laws and regulations, including those affecting us have been enacted relatively recently. As a result, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the scope and application of many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, which increases the risk that we will be subject to claims alleging violations of those laws and regulations. Evolving case law over worker classification, including a recent California Supreme Court decision, also increases litigation in this area and may have ramifications as to how we operate certain segments of our business and our engagement with independent contractors. The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government or regulatory investigations, subpoenas, inquiries or audits and other proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and legal proceedings can have a material and adverse impact on us due to their costs, diversion of our resources, and other factors. Plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of litigation, including preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle legal disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. We may also be accused of having, or be found to have, infringed or violated third-party intellectual property rights. Furthermore, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that we may not choose to appeal or that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights, or we may have to change or cease certain practices. If we are required, or choose to enter into, royalty or licensing arrangements, such arrangements may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop or procure alternative non-infringing technology or discontinue use of technology, and doing so could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. In addition, the terms of any settlement or judgment in connection with any legal claims, lawsuits, or proceedings may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party and could materially and adversely affect our business.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.Our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are critical to our success. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of confidentiality, invention assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, trade secret, and patent rights, to protect our brand and other intellectual property rights. However, various events outside of our control may pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services. Effective protection of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patent rights, and other intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Our intellectual property rights may be infringed, misappropriated, or challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, our reliance on unpatented proprietary information and technology, such as trade secrets and confidential information, depends in part on agreements we have in place with employees and third parties that place restrictions on the use and disclosure of this intellectual property. These agreements may be insufficient or may be breached, or we may not enter into sufficient agreements with such individuals in the first instance, in either case potentially resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, including to our competitors, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage resulting from this intellectual property. Individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements may 68make adverse ownership claims to our current and future intellectual property. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products or services that are substantially similar to ours and that compete with our business.As of September30, 2018, we had 489 issued patents in force in the United States and abroad and 602 filed patent applications pending in the United States and abroad, though there can be no assurance that any or all of these pending applications will ultimately be issued as patents. We also pursue registration of copyrights, trademarks, and domain names in the United States and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, but doing so may not always be successful or cost-effective. In general, we may be unable or, in some instances, choose not to obtain legal protection for our intellectual property, and our existing and future intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection and mechanisms may not be available in those jurisdictions. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries, and the inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. Our intellectual property rights may be contested, circumvented, or found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, diluting, or otherwise violating them.Additionally, our intellectual property rights and other confidential business information is subject to risks of compromise or unauthorized disclosure if our security measures are unable to prevent cyber attacks. Our security measures, including those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempted security breaches or other attacks that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our systems or those of our third-party service providers. Such attacks could lead to the loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary information and other confidential information. Any such attacks, or the perception that such attacks have occurred, could negatively impact our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, our reputation, or customer trust in us and our products.Significant impairments of our intellectual property rights, and limitations on our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs and our existing credit facility contains, and any future debt financing may contain, covenants that impact the operation of our business and pursuit of business opportunities.We have funded our operations since inception primarily through debt and equity financings, bank credit facilities, and capital lease arrangements. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and availability under our line of credit are sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, and service our debt, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be true in the future. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, refinancing needs, business and financial challenges, regulatory surety bond requirements, acquisitions, or unforeseen circumstances and may decide to engage in equity, equity-linked, or debt financings or enter into additional credit facilities for other reasons, and we may not be able to secure any such additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.Our credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, restrictions on certain inter-company transactions, and limitations on dividends and stock repurchases. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to operate our business, obtain additional capital, and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants could result in a default under our existing credit facility and any future financing agreements into which we may enter. If not waived, these defaults could cause indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our other outstanding indebtedness, including our 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes (collectively, the Notes) and any future financing agreements that we may enter into to become immediately due and payable.If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or other securities convertible into equity, including convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any such securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. 69Servicing our Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash, repay the Notes at maturity or repurchase the Notes as required following a fundamental change.On March 6, 2017, we issued $440.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, and on May 25, 2018, we issued $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes.Prior to December 1, 2021, in the case of the 2022 Notes, and prior to February 15, 2023, in the case of the 2023 Notes, the applicable Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions or upon occurrence of certain events. Because the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price for the relevant period in the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2018, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2018. Whether the Notes of either series will be convertible following such calendar quarter will depend on the satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. If holders of the Notes elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Effective October 2018, we revised our prior stated policy of settling conversions through combination settlement with a specified dollar amount of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. We currently expect to settle future conversions in shares of our common stock, which has the effect of including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion in our diluted earnings per share to the extent such shares are not anti-dilutive. We will reevaluate this policy from time to time as conversion notices are received from holders of the Notes. Holders of the Notes also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture governing the Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Notes have not previously been converted or repurchased, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at maturity.Our ability to make required cash payments in connection with conversions of the Notes, repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change or to repay or refinance the Notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We also may not use the cash proceeds we raised through the issuance of the Notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner. Since inception, our business has generated net losses and we may continue to incur significant losses. As a result, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase or repay the Notes or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted.In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. Our failure to repurchase Notes following a fundamental change or to pay cash upon conversion (unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion) or at maturity of the Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under our credit facility, our other outstanding indebtedness or agreements governing our future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the "option counterparties." The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our Class A common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by any option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.70Our reported financial results may be materially and adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could materially and adversely affect the transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls. For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for leasing which will be effective for us in fiscal year 2019. While we continue to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements,we do expect to recordmaterial right to use assets and relatedleaseliabilities onourconsolidated balance sheetsupon adoption, which will increase total assets and liabilities. Changes resulting from this and other new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.If currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.As we continue to expand our global operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our contracts are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, and therefore the majority of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, fluctuations in exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. From time to time, we may enter into forward contracts, options and/or foreign exchange swaps related to specific transaction exposures that arise in the normal course of our business, though we are not currently a party to any such hedging transactions. These and other such hedging activities may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.We may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business.We are subject to income taxes and non-income taxes in the United States and other countries in which we transact or conduct business, and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction. We are subject to review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our financial results and operations could be materially and adversely affected. For example, the Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector of the City and County of San Francisco (the "Tax Collector") has issued a decision regarding the Company's classification of its business activities. Although we disagree with the Tax Collector's decision and contest this classification, the ultimate resolution is uncertain. We are taking steps to vigorously defend our position, including challenging the classification of our primary business activity and the applicable tax rate used. If the Company does not prevail and is otherwise unable to mitigate the impact of this tax we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, together with any associated penalties and interest. This may adversely affect our future cash flows, financial condition and results of operations in the periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, rates, and regulations. For example, on November 6, 2018, residents of the City and County of San Francisco voted on a ballot measure that would apply further taxes on an entitys gross receipts. This measure would go into effect from January 1, 2019. We expect that if the measure is applicable to our business, it could further increaseour exposure to additional taxes and associated penalties and interest and have a material impact on our future cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The determination of our worldwide provision for income and other taxes is highly complex and requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the amount ultimately payable may differ from amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.71Federal income tax reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("2017 Tax Act") was enacted in December 2017 and contains many significant changes to U.S. Federal tax laws. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law. The Company has provided for an estimated effect of the 2017 Tax Act in its financial statements. The 2017 Tax Act requires significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the law and significant estimates in the calculation of the provision for income taxes. However, additional guidance may be issued by the IRS, Department of the Treasury, or other governing bodies that may significantly differ from the Company's interpretation of the law, which could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control within our stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including many of our employees and directors and their affiliates; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including many of our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, held approximately 77.6% of the voting power of our combined outstanding capital stock as of September30, 2018. Our executive officers and directors and their affiliates held approximately 74.2% of the voting power of our combined outstanding capital stock as of September30, 2018. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively hold more than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, and therefore such holders are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. When the shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 5% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock.Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers to entities, including certain charities and foundations, to the extent the transferor retains sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares of Class B common stock. Such conversions of Class B common stock to Class A common stock upon transfer will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, our Class B stockholders retain shares of Class B common stock constituting as little as 10% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock combined, they will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.We will continue to incur significant costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.As a public company, we incur significant legal, financial, and other expenses that private companies do not. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Continuing to comply with these requirements may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel must divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these requirements. If we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE, which could result in potential loss of confidence by our customers and employees, loss of institutional investor interest, fewer business development opportunities, class action or shareholder derivative lawsuits, depressed stock price, limited liquidity of our Class A common stock, and other material adverse consequences. Moreover, we could incur additional compensation costs in the event that we decide to pay cash compensation closer to that of other public technology companies, which would increase our general and administrative expenses and could materially and adversely affect our profitability.72If we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be materially and adversely affected.We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and improve our internal controls over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may discover deficiencies. If we identify material weaknesses in our disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting in the future, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to do so, or if our auditors are unable to attest to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. We have identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the past and have taken steps to remediate such deficiencies. However, our efforts to remediate them may not be effective or prevent any future deficiency in our internal controls. We are required to disclose material changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.The market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock include the following:price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable;changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies generally or of those in our industry in particular;sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes;failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage and/or to provide accurate consensus results of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;the financial or other projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations;changes in the regulatory environment;73actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;actual or perceived data security incidents that we or our service providers may suffer;any significant change in our management; andgeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our Class A common stock.In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the option counterparties. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our Class A common stock. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be. The warrant transactions would separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of any warrants unless, subject to the terms of the warrant transactions, we elect to cash settle the warrants.From time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock.Anti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions (i) creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms; (ii) authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock; (iii) limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; (iv) eliminating the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting or to remove directors without cause; and (v) requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations without the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding capital stock not held by such stockholder.74Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or to our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.If securities or industry analysts publish reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, publish negative research reports about our business, or cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, our share price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our Class A common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts or the information contained in their reports. If one or more analysts publish research reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, or have a negative tone regarding our business, financial or operating performance, industry or end-markets, our share price could decline. In addition, if a majority of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the trading price of our common stock increases. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and is also subject to limitations imposed by certain financial regulations. Additional stock issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders.We may issue additional equity securities to raise capital, make acquisitions, or for a variety of other purposes. Additional issuances of our stock may be made pursuant to the exercise or conversion of new or existing convertible debt securities, warrants, stock options, or other equity incentive awards. Any such issuances will result in dilution to existing holders of our stock. We rely on equity-based compensation as an important tool in recruiting and retaining employees. The amount of dilution due to equity-based compensation of our employees and other additional issuances could be substantial.Item 2.
