Reconfirming commitment to create and deliver
value to shareholders
Denver, Colorado: May 2, 2025 - Liberty Global Ltd. today announces its Q1 2025 financial results.

CEO Mike Fries stated, “In our year-end investor call we outlined the core strategies we are
undertaking to create and deliver value to shareholders following the successful spin-off of our Swiss
subsidiary Sunrise. We made good progress on these plans in the first quarter of 2025.
•   Our Liberty Telecom operations demonstrated resilience in competitive markets, with Virgin Media
    O2 returning to growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA1, and VodafoneZiggo launching the first of
    a series of initiatives to regain commercial momentum.
•   Financing and monetizing our network infrastructure remains a key priority, with Virgin Media Ireland
    expected to reach 80% of homes with fiber by year-end, and Telenet advancing discussions on
    rationalizing the fiber market in Flanders with Proximus. In the UK, we have decided to pause
    VMO2's potential NetCo stake sale process to align with our JV partner, but remain opportunistic on
    both network upgrade and development opportunities.
•   In our Liberty Growth portfolio, we remain committed to realizing $500-$750 million of asset
    disposals and to prioritizing our scale-based investments, including Formula E which has had a
    successful launch to Season 11 of the global racing championship.
•   The FMV of the portfolio increased to $3.3 billion2, with the top seven investments still comprising
    ~75% of the value.
•   And our Liberty Services platforms in finance and tech continue to scale and generate positive Adj.
    EBITDA and Adj. EBITDA less P&E Additions, with Liberty Blume officially launching its B2B
    marketing campaign.
Across the group, our clear focus on unlocking shareholder value remains, as we resumed buybacks
during the quarter towards our 'up to 10% of shares' target for 2025. The balance sheets of our core
operating businesses are strong with no maturities until 20283, and low borrowing costs. Finally, it's
worth noting that Sunrise continues to trade well in the current macro environment following the spin-
off, at over $10 per share of implied value to Liberty Global shareholders.
Our guidance at the Liberty Global corporate level remains unchanged, as does the guidance for all of
our Liberty Telecom operations with the exception of VodafoneZiggo where we have revised guidance
to align with management's new long-term growth strategy."

VMO2 delivers growth in guided revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
metrics and reaffirms all 2025 guidance
VMO2’s first quarter results saw a return to growth in both revenue and Adj. EBITDA on a
guidance basis, representing a sequential improvement versus Q4. Despite a highly competitive
environment, VMO2 continues to drive more value across the fixed base, maintaining ARPU
growth. In mobile, the planned acquisition of spectrum from the VOD/3 merger will further
strengthen VMO2’s network position, alongside customer and digital initiatives to improve
commercial momentum.

Highlights for Q1
•   Fixed strategy update: Announcing pause of NetCo stake sale process to align with JV partner's
    strategic review; also adjusting nexfibre’s build ambition to 2.5 million cumulative premises
    (currently at 2.2 million) by year-end 2025, retaining capital discipline in an increasingly irrational
    altnet environment and remaining opportunistic around M&A
•   Fibre UP: Progressing with the upgrade of existing network to fiber, with a combined fiber footprint
    now at 6.8 million6 premises and launched trials of giffgaff broadband to increase reach and
    leverage VMO2's wholesale capabilities
•   On track to acquire spectrum: Plan to acquire spectrum licenses from VOD/3 merger remains on
    track and will strengthen VMO2's network position considerably

Q1 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP, as reported by Liberty Global)7
•   Revenue of $3,126.3 million, -4.8% YoY on a reported basis and -4.2% on a rebased8 basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by the net effect of (i) lower construction revenue from nexfibre and (ii) lower
        handset sales, partially offset by (a) higher fixed ARPU and (b) an increase in mobile service
        revenue, with each revenue category as defined and reported by the VMO2 JV
•   Adjusted EBITDA9 of $1,073.4 million, flat YoY on a reported basis and +0.6% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by cost efficiencies, partially offset by a decrease in the nexfibre construction
        impact to Adjusted EBITDA
•   Property and equipment additions of $594.2 million, -13.4% YoY on a reported basis and -12.8% on
    a rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA less P&E additions9 of $479.2 million, +23.6% YoY on a reported basis and
    +24.3% on a rebased basis
•   Cash flows from operating activities of -$81.0 million, cash flows from investing activities of -$692.0
    million, and cash flows from financing activities of -$773.0 million

Q1 Financial Highlights (in IFRS, as guided to and aligned with bondholder covenants)10
•   Revenue of £2,480.1 million, -4.2% YoY on a reported and rebased basis
•   Revenue excluding handsets and the impact of nexfibre construction of £2,111.5 million, +0.4% YoY
    on a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of £914.1 million, -1.3% YoY on a reported and rebased basis




                                                                                                              3
     ◦     Q1 2025 included the benefit of £62.6 million of U.S. GAAP/IFRS differences, primarily related
           to (i) the VMO2 JV's investment in CTIL and (ii) leases
•    Adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of nexfibre construction of £921.7 million, +0.8% YoY on a
     reported and rebased basis
•    The drivers of these IFRS changes are largely consistent with those under U.S. GAAP as detailed
     above

Q1 Operating Highlights
•    Broadband net losses of 44,000, primarily driven by elevated churn following a high level of market
     discounting during Q1
•    Postpaid net losses of 122,800, primarily driven by lower value B2B customer disconnections, while
     consumer performance improved compared to Q1 2024
•    Fixed ARPU maintained positive growth supported by value focus and improved retention, with a
     1.6% YoY increase in Q1 ahead of price rise implementation in Q2

2025 VMO2 guidance (in IFRS)(i)
•    We are confirming11:
     ◦     Growth in revenue excluding handsets and the impact of nexfibre construction
     ◦     Growth in Adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of nexfibre construction
     ◦     P&E additions of £2.0 to £2.2 billion
     ◦     Adjusted FCF and cash distributions to shareholders both in the range of £350 to £400 million




(i) Quantitative reconciliations to net earnings/loss (including net earnings/loss growth rates) and cash flow from operating activities for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDAaL and Adjusted FCF guidance for Liberty Global and each of its OpCos cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts as we do not forecast (i) certain
non-cash charges including: the components of non-operating income/expense, depreciation and amortization, and impairment, restructuring and other operating
items included in net earnings/loss from continuing operations, nor (ii) specific changes in working capital that impact cash flows from operating activities. The
items we do not forecast may vary significantly from period to period.




                                                                                                                                                                         4
VodafoneZiggo launches new strategic plan and revises 2025
guidance
VodafoneZiggo’s first quarter results were heavily impacted by the intensely competitive
environment, particularly in the fixed market. During the quarter, we launched new front book
propositions which are the first part of a wider strategic plan to regain commercial momentum.
While the new strategic plan and market environment will impact VodafoneZiggo’s 2025
guidance, notably driving a steeper than expected Adj. EBITDA decline, it will position the
company for growth and future-proof the network through an accelerated DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade
plan.

Highlights for Q1
•   Customer experience: Launched a new fixed front book portfolio with a focus on reliable
    connectivity through Wifi Guarantee, a first in the Dutch market
•   Strategy evolution under new CEO: VodafoneZiggo continues to implement the new strategy with
    a focus on regaining commercial momentum and creating a leaner and more agile organization
•   Guidance update: To support the key investments needed to drive long-term commercial
    momentum, VodafoneZiggo is revising 2025 guidance as outlined below

Q1 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP)
•   Revenue of $1,052.0 million, -5.6% YoY on a reported basis and -2.6% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) a decline in the consumer fixed base, (ii) lower handset sales and (iii)
        lower B2B mobile revenue, partially offset by (a) price indexation, (b) strong growth in Ziggo
        Sport Totaal revenue and (c) continued growth in B2B fixed revenue
•   Adjusted EBITDA of $463.1 million, -10.8% YoY on a reported basis and -8.0% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) the aforementioned decrease in revenue, (ii) higher programming costs
        related to the UEFA broadcast and (iii) higher labor costs related to the collective labor
        agreement, partially offset by (a) cost control measures in areas such as customer service, IT
        and procurement and (b) lower energy costs
•   Cash flows from operating activities of $192.3 million, cash flows from investing activities of -$142.4
    million and cash flows from financing activities of -$667.2 million

Q1 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP) in local currency
•   Revenue of €999.1 million, -2.6% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of €439.7 million, -8.0% on both a reported and rebased basis

Q1 Operating Highlights
•   Broadband net losses of 31,000, primarily driven by continued promotional intensity, despite early
    signs of improvement in churn following the migration of existing customers to the new front book
•   Postpaid net adds of 29,100, primarily driven by growth in B2B
•   Fixed ARPU increased 1.5% YoY, supported by the prior year's price adjustment
•   Implemented an increase in download speeds across the existing broadband portfolio in March




                                                                                                              5

Telenet delivered strong fixed ARPU and revenue growth, on track
to deliver full-year guidance
Telenet’s first quarter results demonstrated resilience in the face of a competitive environment,
with growth in revenue and Adj. EBITDAaL. Telenet continues to leverage the BASE brand to
drive growth in the South of Belgium and BASE's status as a challenger brand means it is well
positioned to defend in the mobile-only segment. Elsewhere, Wyre continues to advance the
FTTH build while also making progress with Proximus and Belgian regulators on the FTTH-
sharing agreement announced last year.

Highlights for Q1
•   Competitive environment: An intensely competitive environment in Belgium remains, resulting in
    pressure on the Telenet brand with BASE partly compensating
•   Price adjustment: Announced a price adjustment of ~3% on the Telenet brand which took effect
    from April
•   FTTH: Wyre is on track to build an additional 375,000 FTTH homes passed by year-end 2025 and
    continued to make progress with Proximus and regulators regarding FTTH-sharing agreement

Q1 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP, as consolidated by Liberty Global)
•   Revenue of $759.7 million, -0.4% YoY on a reported basis and +2.7% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) higher programming revenue and (ii) the benefit of the June 2024 price
        indexation, partially offset by (a) lower handset revenue and (b) lower interconnect revenue
•   Adjusted EBITDA of $301.6 million, -2.2% YoY on a reported basis and +0.8% on a rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDAaL of $301.3 million, -2.2% YoY on a reported basis and +0.8% on a rebased
    basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) the increase in revenue, (ii) lower network operating costs and (iii) cost
        control measures, partially offset by (a) an increase in programming costs, (b) higher staff-
        related expenses following the mandatory 3.6% wage indexation as of January and (c)
        increased sales and marketing costs
•   Property and equipment additions of $246.7 million, +34.3% YoY on a reported basis and +32.4%
    on a rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of $54.9 million, -56.0% YoY on a reported basis and -54.1%
    on a rebased basis

•   Revenue of €721.2 million, +2.7% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of €323.8 million, +2.8% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
    ◦   Q1 2025 included the benefit of €37.4 million of U.S. GAAP/IFRS differences, primarily related
        to (i) sports and film broadcasting rights and (ii) leases
•   Adjusted EBITDAaL of €304.0 million, +2.6% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis



                                                                                                              7
•   The drivers of these IFRS changes are largely consistent with those under U.S. GAAP as detailed
    above

Q1 Operating Highlights
•   Broadband net losses of 2,100, primarily due to continued elevated churn on the Telenet brand,
    which was only partially offset by growth in BASE
•   Postpaid net losses of 3,700, primarily due to the intensely competitive market environment
    following the Digi launch, despite better performance from BASE following portfolio adjustments
    during Q1
•   Fixed ARPU in Q1 saw continued growth of 2.8% supported by the June 2024 price rise, ahead of a
    ~3% adjustment which took effect from April

Virgin Media Ireland continues to drive transformation into full
fiber operator
Virgin Media Ireland’s first quarter results were impacted by the competitive environment in
Ireland which remains intense, driving modest revenue and Adj. EBITDA declines. Despite the
market dynamics, Virgin Media Ireland continues to make strong progress against its key
strategic priorities including FTTH rollout, wholesale penetration and offnet footprint expansion.

Highlights for Q1
•   Network upgrade: Continued to deliver on full fiber upgrade project, with over half of premises
    upgraded to full fiber at the end of Q1
•   Fiber momentum: Almost 60k fiber customers on Virgin Media Ireland's network at the end of Q1,
    including Wholesale customers

Q1 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP)
•   Revenue of $115.8 million, -5.9% YoY on a reported basis and -2.9% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) lower fixed and mobile revenue resulting from the intense competitive
        environment and (ii) lower advertising revenues at VMTV, partially offset by continued strong
        growth in B2B wholesale revenue
•   Adjusted EBITDA of $37.2 million, -7.0% YoY on a reported basis and -4.1% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily due to (i) the aforementioned revenue decline, (ii) the parallel running of IT systems
        and (iii) higher labor costs following annual salary increase
•   Cash flows from operating activities of $12.2 million, cash flows from investing activities of -$41.2
    million, and cash flows from financing activities of $29.1 million

Q1 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP) in local currency
•   Revenue of €110.0 million, -2.9% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of €35.3 million, -4.1% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis

Q1 Operating Highlights
•   Broadband net losses of 1,000, primarily due to continued competitive intensity in the market
•   Postpaid net adds of 900, a sequential and YoY improvement, primarily due to reduced churn
•   Over 1.4 million addressable homes, including offnet footprint

Footnotes for Operating Data and Subscriber Variance Tables:

 (i)
            In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. The mobile subscriber count for the VMO2 JV includes IoT connections, which are
            Machine-to-Machine contract mobile connections, including Smart Metering contract connections. The mobile subscriber count presented above for the VMO2 JV excludes wholesale mobile
            connections of approximately 10,066,600 that are included in the total mobile subscriber count as defined and presented by the VMO2 JV.
 (ii)
            Fixed-line counts for the VodafoneZiggo JV include certain B2B customers and subscribers.

Additional General Notes to Tables:

Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide broadband, telephony, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a
premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with broadband, video or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers.
All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our
broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from
a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception
of our B2B SOHO subscribers and mobile subscribers at medium and large enterprises, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the
nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process.
We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to
time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.

Capital Structure
       •      At March 31, 2025, the blended fully-swapped debt borrowing cost was 5.2% and the average
              tenor of third-party debt (excluding vendor financing and certain other obligations) was 5.0
              years.
       •      In January, VMO2 entered into a $500 million sustainability-linked term loan facility (Term Loan
              Y1, previously termed Y3). Term Loan Y1 matures on March 31, 2031 and bears interest at a
              rate of the Term SOFR plus credit adjustment spread plus 3.25% per annum (subject to
              adjustment based on the achievement or otherwise of certain ESG metrics). $495 million of the
              loan will be an exchange of Term Loan N due 2028 into a new tranche of Term Loan Y due
              2031, which became fungible with Term Loan Y in April.
       •      In April, VMO2 redeemed all of its outstanding 5.00% GBP Senior Secured Notes due 2027 in
              the total amount of £90.4 million.
       •      At March 31, 2025, VMO2 had maximum undrawn commitments of £1,378.0 million equivalent.

Rebase Information
Rebase growth percentages, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a
comparable basis. For purposes of calculating rebase growth rates on a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned
during 2025, we have adjusted our historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 to (i) include the pre-acquisition revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions to the same
extent these entities are included in our results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, (ii) exclude from our rebased
amounts the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of entities disposed of to the same extent these entities are
excluded in our results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, (iii) include in our rebased amounts the impact to revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA of activity between our continuing and discontinued operations related to the Tech Framework that
previously eliminated within our consolidated results, (iv) include in our rebased amounts the revenue and costs for the
temporary elements of transitional and other services provided to iliad, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise, to reflect
amounts related to these services equal to those included in our results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and (v)
reflect the translation of our rebased amounts at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were used to
translate our results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. For entities we have acquired during 2024, we have reflected
the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of these acquired entities in our 2024 rebased amounts based on what we
believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-acquisition financial statements), as
adjusted for the estimated effects of (a) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP and local generally accepted
accounting principles, (b) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (c) any significant differences between
our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and (d) other items we deem appropriate. We do not adjust pre-
acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be
implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired businesses during the pre-acquisition
periods, no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present the revenue, Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of these entities on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post-
acquisition amounts that are included in our results or that the pre-acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not
contain undetected errors. In addition, the rebase growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue, Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates
assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E
Additions that will occur in the future. Investors should view rebase growth as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S.
GAAP measures of performance included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

(i)
          In addition to our acquisitions and dispositions, these rebase adjustments include amounts related to agreements to provide transitional
          and other services to iliad, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise. These adjustments result in an equal amount of fees in both the
          2025 and 2024 periods for those services that are deemed to be temporary in nature.
(ii)
          Amounts reflect 100% of the adjustments made related to the VMO2 JV's and the VodafoneZiggo JV's revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and
          Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions, which we do not consolidate, as we hold a 50% noncontrolling interest in the VMO2 JV and the
          VodafoneZiggo JV.

          Amounts exclude related VAT of $3.2 million and $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, that
          were also financed under these arrangements.
(ii)
          The capital expenditures that we report in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed
          under vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. Instead, these expenditures are reflected as non-cash additions to our property
          and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered, and as repayments of debt when the related principal is repaid.

Glossary
See Reconciliations section of the Appendix below for applicable non-GAAP reconciliations.

10-Q or 10-K: As used herein, the terms 10-Q and 10-K refer to our most recent quarterly or annual report as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as applicable.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and Property and Equipment Additions (P&E Additions):

•    Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating
     performance and is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii)
     evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term,
     Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before net income tax benefit (expense), other non-operating
     income or expenses, net share of results of affiliates, net gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, net realized and unrealized gains
     (losses) due to changes in fair values of certain investments, net foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net gains (losses) on
     derivative instruments, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision
     releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains
     and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions
     and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains
     and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure
     because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows
     management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3)
     identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our consolidated Adjusted
     EBITDA measure, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance
     with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to
     similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDA of our Liberty Growth strategic platform and our Liberty Services
     strategic platform, together with our corporate functions, are each non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed
     as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our
     condensed consolidated statements of operations.

•    Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions: We define Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions, which is a non-GAAP measure, as Adjusted
     EBITDA less P&E Additions on an accrual basis. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions is a meaningful measure because it provides (i) a
     transparent view of Adjusted EBITDA that remains after our capital spend, which we believe is important to take into account when
     evaluating our overall performance and (ii) a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies. Our
     Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions measure may differ from how other companies define and apply their definition of similar measures.
     Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a
     substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

•    P&E Additions: Includes capital expenditures, including capitalized software, on an accrual basis, amounts financed under vendor
     financing or finance lease arrangements and other non-cash additions.

Adjusted EBITDA after leases (Adjusted EBITDAaL): We define Adjusted EBITDAaL as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to include finance
lease related depreciation and interest expense. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDAaL is a meaningful measure because it
represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that includes recurring lease expenses necessary to operate our
business. We believe Adjusted EBITDAaL, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing
our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly
comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDAaL should be viewed as a measure of operating
performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF) & Distributable Cash Flow:

•    Adjusted FCF: We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related
     vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor
     payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash
     payments in the period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors
     and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and
     intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (iii) principal payments on
     finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our condensed consolidated
     statements of cash flows with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. Net cash provided by
     operating activities of our continuing operations includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and
     unsuccessful acquisition and dispositions of $0.8 million and $5.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,
     respectively.

     For purposes of the statements of cash flows, operating-related vendor financing additions represent operating-related expenses
     financed by an intermediary that are treated as constructive operating cash outflows and constructive financing cash inflows when the
     intermediary settles the liability with the vendor. When the financing intermediary is paid, a financing cash outflow is recorded in the
     statements of cash flows. For purposes of Adjusted FCF, we (i) add in the constructive financing cash inflow when the intermediary settles




                                                                                                                                             40
     the liability with the vendor as our actual net cash available at that time is not affected and (ii) subsequently deduct the related financing
     cash outflow when we actually pay the financing intermediary, reflecting the actual reduction to our cash available to service debt or fund
     new investment opportunities.

•    Distributable Cash Flow: We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted FCF plus any dividends received from our equity affiliates that
     are funded by activities outside of their normal course of operations, including, for example, those funded by recapitalizations (referred to
     as “Other Affiliate Dividends”).

•    VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF: VodafoneZiggo defines Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities, plus (i) operating-
     related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to actual cash available as a result of extending vendor
     payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities) and (ii) interest
     payments on shareholder loans, less (a) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures (excluding spectrum payments), (b)
     principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in
     the period to actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended
     vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (c) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the
     period to actual cash available).

     We believe our presentation of Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF, each of which is a non-GAAP
     measure, provides useful information to our investors because these measures can be used to gauge our ability to (i) service debt and (ii)
     fund new investment opportunities after consideration of all actual cash payments related to our working capital activities and expenses
     that are capital in nature, whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which
     case we typically pay in less than 365 days). Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF should not be
     understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including
     debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at these amounts. Investors should view Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and
     VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF as supplements to, and not substitutes for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our condensed
     consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF may differ
     from how other companies define and apply their definition of Adjusted FCF or other similar measures.

ARPU: Average Revenue Per Unit is the average monthly subscription revenue per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber,
as applicable. ARPU per average fixed-line customer relationship is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from
residential fixed and SOHO services by the average number of fixed-line customer relationships for the period. ARPU per average mobile
subscriber is calculated by dividing mobile subscription revenue for the indicated period by the average number of mobile subscribers for the
period. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber is not adjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per
RGU refers to average monthly revenue per average RGU, which is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from
residential and SOHO services for the indicated period, by the average number of the applicable RGUs for the period. Unless otherwise noted,
ARPU in this release is considered to be ARPU per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Fixed-line
customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs of entities acquired during the period are normalized. In addition, for purposes of
calculating the percentage change in ARPU on a rebased basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, we adjust the prior-year subscription revenue,
fixed-line customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs, as applicable, to reflect acquisitions, dispositions and FX on a comparable
basis with the current year, consistent with how we calculate our rebased growth for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, as further described in the
body of this release.

ARPU per Consumer Postpaid Mobile Subscriber: Our ARPU per consumer postpaid mobile subscriber calculation refers to the average
monthly postpaid mobile subscription revenue per average consumer postpaid mobile subscriber and is calculated by dividing the average
monthly postpaid mobile subscription revenue (excluding handset sales and late fees) for the indicated period, by the monthly average of the
opening and closing balances of consumer postpaid mobile subscribers in service for the period.

Blended, fully-swapped debt borrowing cost (or WACD): The weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate
indebtedness (excluding finance leases and including vendor financing obligations), including the effects of derivative instruments, original
issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs. The weighted average interest rate calculation
includes principal amounts outstanding associated with all of our secured and unsecured borrowings.

Broadband Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that
we service through a partner network.

B2B: Business-to-Business.

Costs to capture: Costs to capture generally include incremental, third-party operating and capital related costs that are directly associated
with integration activities, restructuring activities and certain other costs associated with aligning an acquiree to our business processes to
derive synergies. These costs are necessary to combine the operations of a business being acquired (or joint venture being formed) with ours
or are incidental to the acquisition. As a result, costs to capture may include certain (i) operating costs that are included in Adjusted EBITDA,
(ii) capital-related costs that are included in property and equipment additions and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and (iii) certain
integration-related restructuring expenses that are not included within Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions. Given the
achievement of synergies occurs over time, certain of our costs to capture are recurring by nature, and generally incurred within a few years of
completing the transaction.

Customer Churn: The rate at which customers relinquish their subscriptions. The annual rolling average basis is calculated by dividing the
number of disconnects during the preceding 12 months by the average number of customer relationships. For the purpose of computing churn,




                                                                                                                                                41
a disconnect is deemed to have occurred if the customer no longer receives any level of service from us and is required to return our
equipment. A partial product downgrade, typically used to encourage customers to pay an outstanding bill and avoid complete service
disconnection, is not considered to be disconnected for purposes of our churn calculations. Customers who move within our footprint and
upgrades and downgrades between services are also excluded from the disconnect figures used in the churn calculation.

Fixed-Line Customer Relationships: The number of customers who receive at least one of our broadband, video or telephony services that we
count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on
a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that
individual generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer
Relationships.

Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC): Fixed-mobile convergence penetration represents the number of customers who subscribe to both a fixed
broadband service and postpaid mobile telephony service, divided by the total number of customers who subscribe to our fixed broadband
service.

Homes Passed: Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially
extending the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to
the data or from new census results.

Homes Serviceable: As defined by VMO2, this includes homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to
VMO2's networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services (including broadband, video and telephony services) or
partner networks with which VMO2 has a service agreement, where customers can request and receive services, without materially extending
the distribution plant. Certain of VMO2's Homes Serviceable counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to
the data or from new census results.

Liberty Growth: Represents certain investments in technology, media, sports and digital infrastructure companies that we view as scalable
businesses. Our Liberty Growth strategic platform is included in the "all other category" in the 10-Q.

Liberty Services & Corporate: Includes our Liberty Services strategic platform and certain corporate activities, each of which is included in the
“all other category” in the 10-Q. While certain of these functions provide services to investments included in our Liberty Growth strategic
platform, we have not allocated these costs or cash flows in our internal management reporting or external disclosures.

Mobile Subscriber Count: For residential and business subscribers, the number of active SIM cards in service rather than services provided.
For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively,
a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers. In
a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. Customers who do not pay a recurring
monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry
standards within the respective country. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VMO2 JV's and the VodafoneZiggo JV's mobile
subscriber counts after a period of inactivity of three months and nine months, respectively.

MVNO: Mobile Virtual Network Operator.

RGU: A Revenue Generating Unit is separately a Broadband Subscriber, Video Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential
multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer subscribed to our broadband
service, video service and fixed-line telephony service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Broadband, Video
and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premise does not count as more than
one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a
vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled broadband, video or telephony service is counted as a
separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their
free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without
charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include
subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported
postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

SIM: Subscriber Identification Module.

SOHO: Small or Home Office Subscribers.

Tech Framework: Our centrally-managed technology and innovation function (our T&I Function) provides, and allocates charges for, certain
products and services to our consolidated reportable segments (the Tech Framework). These products and services include CPE hardware
and related essential software, maintenance, hosting and other services. Our consolidated reportable segments capitalize the combined cost
of the CPE hardware and essential software as property and equipment additions and the corresponding amounts charged by our T&I
Function are reflected as revenue when earned.

Telephony Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we
service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers.

Video Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or




                                                                                                                                              42
