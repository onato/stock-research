Liberty Global Reports Q4 and FY 2024 Results
Achieved all full-year guidance targets at Telenet and VMO2, while
VodafoneZiggo delivered stable revenue and met all other metrics

$2.2 billion cash balance supported by ~$900 million of non-core asset
disposals; further $500 million to $750 million targeted in 2025

Successfully completed Sunrise spin in November; representing a CHF 3.0
billion1 tax-free dividend to Liberty Global shareholders

Record year for shareholder remuneration supported by ~$700 million
buyback in 2024; announcing a further buyback program of up to 10% of
shares outstanding in 2025



Denver, Colorado: February 18, 2025
Liberty Global Ltd. today announced its Q4 2024 financial results.

CEO Mike Fries stated, “In 2024 we successfully managed through what continues to be a challenging
competitive environment, including difficult prior year comparisons in Q4, to achieve all full-year
guidance metrics across our Liberty Telecom businesses, with the exception of the stable revenue
result at VodafoneZiggo. Fixed ARPU grew across all of our core Liberty Telecom assets during both
the quarter and the full year, and in Belgium and the U.K. we delivered growth in broadband net adds
for Q4. We're well-positioned to defend and grow market share, with our main brands underpinning
value in premium segments and our flanker brands driving growth in low-cost segments, all
underpinned by customer centricity, digital and AI initiatives, and our next-generation networks.

We continue to invest in our fiber-rich networks, with FTTH programs ramping across the U.K.,
Belgium, and Ireland. In the U.K., we now reach 6.4 million2 premises with fiber, and preparations for a
fixed NetCo are progressing on track with a perimeter now defined. In Belgium, our fiber sharing
agreement with Proximus is pending regulatory approval, and we've successfully secured commitments
for a standalone €500 million capex facility for our NetCo in that market called Wyre. In mobile, VMO2
continues to advance its 5G network, with outdoor coverage now reaching 75% of the U.K., and further
improvements to be underpinned by the acquisition of spectrum from Vodafone-Three, which is
expected to occur later this year.

During the quarter, we successfully increased our stake in Formula E to 66%. As a global championship
with ~400 million racing fans, the business is on an impressive trajectory, and with our control position
we're excited to unlock its future growth potential. Elsewhere in our Liberty Growth portfolio, we
continue rotating capital into scale-based businesses with unique opportunities to create value. Our top

                                                                                                            1
seven investments now account for 75% of the portfolio's FMV, and following the ~$900 million3 in
proceeds from non-core asset disposals since October 2023, we're targeting a further $500 million to
$750 million in 2025.

Our balance sheet remains strong, with over $2.2 billion(i) of consolidated cash, an average long-term
debt tenor of ~5 years4, and no material debt repayments until 2028. The year-end cash balance
reflects the $1.6 billion capital injection into Sunrise ahead of its November spin, funded by less than $1
billion of corporate cash, ~$420 million from the sale of our stake in All3Media, and Sunrise Adj FCF.
Dividend distributions of ~$600 million were received from VMO2 and VodafoneZiggo during Q4.

2024 was a record year for shareholder remuneration at Liberty Global. In November we successfully
distributed 100% of the shares of our Swiss subsidiary Sunrise to shareholders, resulting in a CHF 3
billion tax-free dividend. The combined trading performance of both LBTY and Sunrise has
demonstrated the inherent value embedded in our telco businesses, with Sunrise now trading at nearly
8x Adj EBITDA (versus 5.5x for Liberty Global). On top of this, we completed a ~$700 million buyback
program to repurchase ~10% of our shares during the year, ending with ~349 million shares
outstanding.

In 2025 we remain laser-focused on unlocking further value for shareholders. We'll continue to position
our Liberty Telecom assets for opportunistic transactions that crystallize and, in time, distribute value to
shareholders. We will focus on the inherent value of our fixed networks and, specifically, seek to raise
capital for our fiber NetCos in Belgium and the U.K. Finally, we continue to see compelling value in our
stock and we're announcing today a buyback program of up to 10% of shares outstanding in 2025.

Q4 Operating Company Highlights




             (Consolidated)

Telenet delivers on all 2024 financial guidance

Operating highlights: During Q4, Telenet delivered a return to positive broadband net adds of 3,200,
supported by the nationwide launch of the BASE FMC offer in June last year. Since launching, BASE
has sold over 25,000 broadband subscriptions. In mobile, the postpaid base declined modestly by
1,800, reflecting the intensely competitive market environment. FMC households increased by 12,200
to reach 861,000, Telenet's best quarterly performance in two years.

Financial highlights: Revenue of $781.5 million in Q4 2024 decreased 1.4% YoY on a reported basis
and 0.4% on a rebased5 basis. The rebased decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the customer
base, partially offset by (i) the 3.5% price rise and (ii) the continued shift towards higher tier broadband

                                                                                                               2
plans. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.7% YoY on a reported basis and 3.9% on a rebased basis to
$311.0 million in Q4. The rebased decrease was primarily due to (a) higher staff-related expenses and
(b) higher programming costs. Reported and rebased Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions decreased
50.1% and 49.5%, respectively, to $45.9 million in Q4.




                 (Nonconsolidated Joint Venture)

VMO2 achieves 2024 guidance, delivering synergies ahead of schedule and strong progress in
network evolution

Operating highlights: VMO2 ended the year with another quarter of fixed customer growth, delivering
net adds of 9,900 and fixed ARPU growth of 2.0%. Growth in the customer base was driven by
improved performance on the nexfibre footprint, where quarterly net additions increased sequentially
through the year, supported by build momentum and investment in sales and marketing. Positive
growth in fixed ARPU continued, with a 2.0% increase YoY. In mobile, postpaid performance continued
to improve through the year and returned to growth in Q4, with 15,600 net additions during the quarter.

VMO2 achieved record footprint expansion in 2024, growing its reach by an additional 1.3 million
homes serviceable, and bringing the total gigabit footprint to 18.3 million homes at the end of the year.
Expansion was primarily through build on behalf of nexfibre, including the transfer of Upp premises
following the successful integration of the altnet. Meanwhile, the upgrade of VMO2's existing fixed
network to fiber also continued apace across the year, with a total fiber footprint of 6.4 million premises
when including the nexfibre footprint. Significant progress was also made in the evolution of VMO2's
mobile network to 5G, with U.K. outdoor population coverage standing at 75% at the end of 2024. Later
this year, VMO2 will acquire spectrum from Vodafone-Three following completion of the merger. The
target of £540 million of annualized run-rate synergies five years post closing was achieved by the end
of 2024, approximately 18 months ahead of the original target.

Financial highlights (in U.S. GAAP)6: Revenue12 of $3,478.8 million in Q4 2024 decreased 1.1% YoY on
a reported basis and 4.0% YoY on a rebased basis. The rebased decrease was primarily due to the net
effect of (i) a decrease in mobile revenue due to lower handset sales, (ii) a decrease in B2B revenue
and (iii) an increase in residential fixed revenue, with each revenue category as defined and reported by
the VMO2 JV. Q4 Adjusted EBITDA12 decreased 5.8% YoY on a reported basis and 8.6% YoY on a
rebased basis to $1,126.5 million, including $27 million of opex costs to capture7. The YoY decrease in
Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the net effect of (a) the aforementioned changes in revenue, (b)
a handset inventory-related adjustment increasing cost of sales by approximately $27 million in Q4
2024, (c) a reduction in costs of $19 million in Q4 2023 due to a change in the contract terms of
services provided by a related-party and (d) a benefit of approximately $16 million during Q4 2024
related to higher capitalized costs by the VMO2 JV due to a change in the terms of a related-party
contract. Q4 Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions12 decreased 36.2% YoY on a reported basis and
38.2% YoY on a rebased basis to $424.8 million, including $53 million of opex and capex costs to
capture.

Financial highlights (in IFRS): Revenue of £2,716.2 million ($3,478.8 million) in Q4 2024 decreased
4.0% YoY on a rebased basis. Q4 Adjusted EBITDA of £989.1 million ($1,267.0 million), including costs
to capture, decreased 7.0% YoY on a rebased basis. Q4 Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of
                                                                                                              3
£374.8 million ($480.1 million), including costs to capture, decreased 33.6% YoY on a rebased basis.
The drivers of these IFRS changes are largely consistent with those under U.S. GAAP detailed above.

2025 Guidance (in IFRS, as guided by the VMO2 JV): Expect to deliver growth in revenue (excluding
handsets and the impact of nexfibre construction) and growth in Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact
of nexfibre construction). Expect support from pricing, nexfibre penetration, and step down in the one-
off opex investment in 2024. Expect P&E additions of £2.0 to £2.2 billion (excluding ROU additions),
with continued elevated 5G and FTTH spend through Fibre Up. Expect Adjusted FCF and cash
distributions to shareholders both in the range of £350 to £400 million.

relations page to access the Q4 earnings release.
(ii)
       U.S. GAAP guidance for the VMO2 JV cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as the VMO2 JV reports under IFRS and does
       not have U.S. GAAP forecasts for all components of their IFRS guidance. Quantitative reconciliations to net earnings/loss (including net
       earnings/loss growth rates) and cash flow from operating activities for the VMO2 JV's Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FCF guidance
       cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts as they do not forecast (i) certain non-cash charges including: the components of non-
       operating income/expense, depreciation and amortization and impairment, restructuring and other operating items included in net
       earnings/loss, nor (ii) specific changes in working capital that impact cash flows from operating activities. The items they do not forecast
       may vary significantly from period to period.




                                    (Nonconsolidated Joint Venture)

VodafoneZiggo delivers a stable revenue result and achieved all other 2024 guidance

Operating highlights: During Q4, mobile postpaid net adds grew by 800. The broadband base
contracted by 30,200 in the quarter amidst the continued promotional intensity in the market, as a
36,000 decline in Consumer was only partially offset by a 5,800 increase in B2B. Fixed ARPU growth in
the quarter was supported by the fixed price indexation in July. In mobile, postpaid ARPU declined by
2.3%. FMC8 households grew by 1,700 during the quarter to reach 1.5 million at year end.

Financial highlights: Revenue decreased 3.4% YoY on a reported basis and 2.5% YoY on a rebased
basis to $1,113.8 million in Q4. The rebased decrease was primarily due to (i) a decline in the
consumer fixed customer base, (ii) lower out of bundle revenue and (iii) a decrease in low-margin
handset sales, partially offset by growth in Ziggo Sport Totaal subscribers and continued growth in B2B
revenue. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.9% YoY on a reported basis and 4.8% on a rebased basis to
$468.4 million in Q4. The rebased decrease was primarily driven by (a) the aforementioned decrease in
revenue, (b) higher programming costs related to the UEFA broadcast, (c) wage increases related to
the collective labor agreement and (d) an $8 million one-off impact following the sale of certain handset
receivables during the quarter, partially offset by (1) cost control measures in customer service, IT,
procurement and business contracting services and (2) lower energy costs. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E
Additions increased 3.7% YoY on a reported basis and 4.9% on a rebased basis to $254.8 million in
Q4.

Rebase Information
Rebase growth percentages, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a
comparable basis. For purposes of calculating rebase growth rates on a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned
during 2024, we have adjusted (i) our historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions for the
three months and year ended December 31, 2023 to (a) include the pre-acquisition revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E
Additions to the same extent these entities are included in our results for the three months and year ended December 31,
2024, (b) exclude from our rebased amounts the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of entities disposed of to the
same extent these entities are excluded in our results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, (c) include in
our rebased amounts the impact to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of activity between our continuing and discontinued
operations related to the Tech Framework that previously eliminated within our consolidated results, (d) include in our rebased
amounts the revenue and costs for the temporary elements of transitional and other services provided to iliad, Vodafone,
Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise, to reflect amounts related to these services equal to those included in our results for the three
months and year ended December 31, 2024 and (e) reflect the translation of our rebased amounts at the applicable average
foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the three months and year ended December 31,
2024, and (ii) our historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions for the three months and year
ended December 31, 2024 to include activity between our continuing and discontinued operations related to the Tech
Framework that previously eliminated within our consolidated results. For entities we have acquired during 2024, we have
reflected the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of these acquired entities in our 2023 rebased amounts based on
what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-acquisition financial
statements), as adjusted for the estimated effects of (1) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP and local generally
accepted accounting principles, (2) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (3) any significant differences
between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and (4) other items we deem appropriate. We do not adjust
pre-acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be
implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired businesses during the pre-acquisition
periods, no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present the revenue, Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of these entities on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post-
acquisition amounts that are included in our results or that the pre-acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not
contain undetected errors. In addition, the rebase growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue, Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates
assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E
Additions that will occur in the future. Investors should view rebase growth as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S.
GAAP measures of performance included in our consolidated statements of operations.

Footnotes for Operating Data and Subscriber Variance Tables


 (i)
         At UPC Slovakia we have approximately 26,400 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video service, with only a few
         channels.
 (ii)
         In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2024, our mobile subscriber count included approximately 195,100,
         7,369,800 and 284,500 prepaid mobile subscribers at Telenet, the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, respectively. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VMO2 JV's and the
         VodafoneZiggo JV's mobile subscriber counts after a period of inactivity of three months and nine months, respectively. The mobile subscriber count for the VMO2 JV includes IoT connections,
         which are Machine-to-Machine contract mobile connections, including Smart Metering contract connections. The mobile subscriber count presented above for the VMO2 JV excludes wholesale
         mobile connections of approximately 10,048,200 that are included in the total mobile subscriber count as defined and presented by the VMO2 JV.
 (iii)
         Includes our Eltrona business in Luxembourg.
 (iv)
         Fixed-line counts for the VodafoneZiggo JV include certain B2B customers and subscribers.


Additional General Notes to Tables:

Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide broadband internet, telephony, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a
premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with internet, video or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All
mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our
broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from
a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception
of our B2B SOHO subscribers and mobile subscribers at medium and large enterprises, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the
nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process.
We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to
time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.




                                                                                                                                                                                                             19

     to the acquisition. As a result, costs to capture may include certain (i) operating costs that are included in Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) capital-related
     costs that are included in property and equipment additions and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and (iii) certain integration-related
     restructuring expenses that are not included within Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions. Given the achievement of
     synergies occurs over time, certain of our costs to capture are recurring by nature, and generally incurred within a few years of completing the
     transaction.

9    Liquidity refers to cash and cash equivalents and investments held under separately managed accounts plus the maximum undrawn
     commitments under subsidiary borrowing facilities, without regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to
     borrowing.
10   Our aggregate unused borrowing capacity of $0.7 billion represents the maximum undrawn commitments under the applicable facilities without
     regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. Upon completion of the relevant December 31, 2024
     compliance reporting requirements for our credit facilities, and assuming no further changes from quarter-end borrowing levels, we anticipate
     that the full unused borrowing capacity will continue to be available under each of the respective subsidiary facilities. Our above expectations
     do not consider any actual or potential changes to our borrowing levels or any amounts loaned or distributed subsequent to December 31,
     2024.
11   For purposes of calculating our average tenor, total third-party debt excludes vendor financing, certain debt obligations that we assumed in
     connection with various acquisitions, debt collateralized by certain trade receivables of Telenet and liabilities related to Telenet's acquisition of
     mobile spectrum licenses. The percentage of debt not due until 2029 or thereafter includes all of these amounts.

Glossary
10-Q or 10-K: As used herein, the terms 10-Q and 10-K refer to our most recent quarterly or annual report as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as applicable.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and Property and Equipment Additions (P&E Additions):

•    Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating
     performance and is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii) evaluate
     the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, Adjusted EBITDA is
     defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before net income tax benefit (expense), other non-operating income or expenses, net
     share of results of affiliates, net gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) due to changes in fair values
     of certain investments, net foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net interest expense,
     depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment,
     restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-
     party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees,
     as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal
     decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating
     performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical
     comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in
     which we operate. We believe our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA measure, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is
     one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our
     measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDA of our Liberty Growth
     strategic platform and our Liberty Services strategic platform, together with our corporate functions, are each non-GAAP measures. These
     non-GAAP measures should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP
     measures of income included in our consolidated statements of operations.

•    Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions: We define Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions, which is a non-GAAP measure, as Adjusted EBITDA
     less P&E Additions on an accrual basis. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions is a meaningful measure because it provides (i) a transparent
     view of Adjusted EBITDA that remains after our capital spend, which we believe is important to take into account when evaluating our overall
     performance and (ii) a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA less P&E
     Additions measure may differ from how other companies define and apply their definition of similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E
     Additions should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of
     income included in our consolidated statements of operations.

•    P&E Additions: Includes capital expenditures on an accrual basis, amounts financed under vendor financing or finance lease arrangements
     and other non-cash additions.

Adjusted EBITDA after leases (Adjusted EBITDAaL): We define Adjusted EBITDAaL as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to include finance
lease related depreciation and interest expense. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDAaL is a meaningful measure because it
represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that includes recurring lease expenses necessary to operate our
business. We believe Adjusted EBITDAaL, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our
performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to
similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDAaL should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a
supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our consolidated statements of operations.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF) & Distributable Cash Flow:

•   Adjusted FCF: We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related vendor
    financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms
    beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash payments in the period
    for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which
    represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we
    previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (iii) principal payments on finance leases (which
    represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows with each item
    excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. Net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations
    includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisition and dispositions of $1.5 million and
    $3.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $9.1 million and $27.7 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

•   Distributable Cash Flow: We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted FCF plus any dividends received from our equity affiliates that are
    funded by activities outside of their normal course of operations, including, for example, those funded by recapitalizations (referred to as “Other
    Affiliate Dividends”).




                                                                                                                                                                                                24
     We believe our presentation of Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, provides useful information
     to our investors because these measures can be used to gauge our ability to (i) service debt and (ii) fund new investment opportunities after
     consideration of all actual cash payments related to our working capital activities and expenses that are capital in nature, whether paid inside
     normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which case we typically pay in less than 365 days).
     Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have
     various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at these amounts. Investors should
     view Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow as supplements to, and not substitutes for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our
     consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow may differ from how other companies define
     and apply their definition of Adjusted FCF or other similar measures. The following table provides a reconciliation of our net cash provided by
     operating activities to Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow for the indicated periods.

     _______________
     (i)
              For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, operating-related vendor financing additions represent operating-related
              expenses financed by an intermediary that are treated as constructive operating cash outflows and constructive financing cash inflows
              when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor. When we pay the financing intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in
              our consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our Adjusted FCF definition, we (i) add in the constructive financing cash
              inflow when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor as our actual net cash available at that time is not affected and (ii)
              subsequently deduct the related financing cash outflow when we actually pay the financing intermediary, reflecting the actual reduction to
              our cash available to service debt or fund new investment opportunities.

ARPU: Average Revenue Per Unit is the average monthly subscription revenue per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as
applicable. ARPU per average fixed-line customer relationship is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from residential
fixed and SOHO services by the average number of fixed-line customer relationships for the period. ARPU per average mobile subscriber is
calculated by dividing mobile subscription revenue for the indicated period by the average number of mobile subscribers for the period. Unless
otherwise indicated, ARPU per fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber is not adjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per RGU refers to
average monthly revenue per average RGU, which is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from residential and SOHO
services for the indicated period, by the average number of the applicable RGUs for the period. Unless otherwise noted, ARPU in this release is
considered to be ARPU per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Fixed-line customer relationships, mobile
subscribers and RGUs of entities acquired during the period are normalized. In addition, for purposes of calculating the percentage change in
ARPU on a rebased basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, we adjust the prior-year subscription revenue, fixed-line customer relationships, mobile
subscribers and RGUs, as applicable, to reflect acquisitions, dispositions and FX on a comparable basis with the current year, consistent with how
we calculate our rebased growth for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, as further described in the body of this release.

ARPU per Mobile Subscriber: Our ARPU per mobile subscriber calculation that excludes interconnect revenue refers to the average monthly mobile
subscription revenue per average mobile subscriber and is calculated by dividing the average monthly mobile subscription revenue (excluding
handset sales and late fees) for the indicated period, by the monthly average of the opening and closing balances of mobile subscribers in service
for the period. Our ARPU per mobile subscriber calculation that includes interconnect revenue increases the numerator in the above-described
calculation by the amount of mobile interconnect revenue during the period.

Blended, fully-swapped debt borrowing cost (or WACD): The weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness
(excluding finance leases and including vendor financing obligations), including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or
discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs. The weighted average interest rate calculation includes principal
amounts outstanding associated with all of our secured and unsecured borrowings.

B2B: Business-to-Business.

Customer Churn: The rate at which customers relinquish their subscriptions. The annual rolling average basis is calculated by dividing the number
of disconnects during the preceding 12 months by the average number of customer relationships. For the purpose of computing churn, a disconnect
is deemed to have occurred if the customer no longer receives any level of service from us and is required to return our equipment. A partial product
downgrade, typically used to encourage customers to pay an outstanding bill and avoid complete service disconnection, is not considered to be
disconnected for purposes of our churn calculations. Customers who move within our footprint and upgrades and downgrades between services are
also excluded from the disconnect figures used in the churn calculation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                25
Debt and Net Debt Ratios: Our debt and net debt ratios, which are non-GAAP metrics, are defined as total consolidated debt and net debt,
respectively, divided by reported net earnings for the last twelve months (reported LTM net earnings) and Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve
months (LTM Adjusted EBITDA). Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and investments held under SMAs. For purposes
of these calculations, debt is measured using swapped foreign currency rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our
subsidiary debt agreements. The following table details the calculation of our consolidated debt and net debt to reported LTM net earnings and LTM
Adjusted EBITDA ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except ratios):

Fixed-Line Customer Relationships: The number of customers who receive at least one of our internet, video or telephony services that we count as
RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique
premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual
generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer Relationships.

Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC): Fixed-mobile convergence penetration represents the number of customers who subscribe to both a fixed
broadband internet service and postpaid mobile telephony service, divided by the total number of customers who subscribe to our fixed broadband
internet service.

Homes Passed: Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending
the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from
new census results.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          26
Internet Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we
service through a partner network.

Mobile Subscriber Count: For residential and business subscribers, the number of active SIM cards in service rather than services provided. For
example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a
subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers.
Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from
30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services
pursuant to prepaid contracts.

MVNO: Mobile Virtual Network Operator.

RGU: A Revenue Generating Unit is separately an Internet Subscriber, Video Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple
dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer subscribed to our broadband internet
service, video service and fixed-line telephony service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Internet, Video and
Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premise does not count as more than one RGU
for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home),
that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled internet, video or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless
of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service
period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis
(e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our
externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

SIM: Subscriber Identification Module.

SOHO: Small or Home Office Subscribers.

Tech Framework: Our centrally-managed technology and innovation function (our T&I Function) provides, and allocates charges for, certain
products and services to our consolidated reportable segments (the Tech Framework). These products and services include CPE hardware and
related essential software, maintenance, hosting and other services. Our consolidated reportable segments capitalize the combined cost of the CPE
hardware and essential software as property and equipment additions and the corresponding amounts charged by our T&I Function are reflected as
revenue when earned.

Telephony Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we
service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers.

U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Video Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or
through a partner network.

YoY: Year-over-year.
