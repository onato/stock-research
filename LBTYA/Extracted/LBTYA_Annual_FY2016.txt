General Development of Business

    As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent
company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc.
(Virgin Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires,
to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries. Unless
otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2016, and
operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2016.

     On December 31, 2016, our company and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) formed a 50:50 joint venture, called
VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. (VodafoneZiggo). VodafoneZiggo combined our subsidiary VodafoneZiggo Holding
B.V., formerly known as Ziggo Group Holding B.V. (Ziggo Group Holding), with Vodafone’s mobile business in the
Netherlands to create a national unified communications provider in the Netherlands with complementary strengths across
video, broadband, mobile and business services. As a result of the formation of VodafoneZiggo, effective December 31,
2016, we treat VodafoneZiggo as an equity method investment and no longer consolidate Ziggo Group Holding. For additional
information on this transaction, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

  Expansion and Acquisitions

     We have expanded our broadband footprint through new build projects and strategically selected acquisitions. Our new
build projects consist of network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our
broadband communications network (Network Extensions). Our investment in Network Extensions is critical not only for
our business to grow, but also for the countries and communities in which we operate. The Network Extensions, together
with upgrades to our existing networks and next generation customer premises equipment, provide our customers the means
to enter the gigaworld society. During 2016, we initiated Network Extensions in the Germany, Chile, Central and Eastern
Europe and certain other markets. During 2015 and 2016, we connected 567,000 homes and commercial premises to Virgin
Media’s two-way network (including technical upgrades in the United Kingdom (U.K.)). During 2016, we connected
approximately 1.0 million homes and commercial premises (including upgrades in Germany and Chile) to our two-way
networks in the other markets mentioned above. Pursuant to Network Extensions, in 2017, we expect to (1) connect 1.3
million to 1.4 million additional homes and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks attributed
to the “Liberty Global Group” (as defined and described below) and (2) connect or upgrade approximately 450,000
additional homes and commercial premises to our two-way networks attributed to the “LiLAC Group” (as defined and
described below). Depending on a variety of factors, however, including the financial and operations results of the earlier
phases of our new build programs, any Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion. For
further information on Network Extensions, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations-Overview included in Part II of this Annual Report.

     Over the past decade, we have also completed several strategic acquisitions both in Europe and in Latin America. We

    Recently, we announced two additional acquisitions related to our operations in Europe:

included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have also completed various other smaller dispositions in the
normal course of business and as required by regulatory authorities in connection with approving the BASE and Ziggo
acquisitions.

  Tracking Shares

     On July 1, 2015, we completed the approved steps of the “LiLAC Transaction” whereby we (1) reclassified our then
outstanding Class A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively, the Old Liberty Global Shares)
into corresponding classes of new Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively, the Liberty Global Shares) and (2)
capitalized a portion of our share premium account and distributed as a dividend (or a “bonus issue” under U.K. law) our
LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the LiLAC Shares). Pursuant to the LiLAC Transaction,
each holder of Class A, Class B and Class C Old Liberty Global Shares remained a holder of the same amount and class of
Liberty Global Shares and received one share of the corresponding class of LiLAC Shares for each 20 Old Liberty Global
Shares held as of the record date for such distribution and cash was issued in lieu of fractional LiLAC Shares.

    The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are tracking shares. Tracking shares are intended by the issuing
company to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic
performance of the company as a whole. The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are intended to track the economic
performance of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, respectively (each as defined and described below). While

                                                              I-3
the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to
them, neither group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding
agreements. Holders of tracking shares have no direct claim to the group’s assets and are not represented by separate boards
of directors. Instead, holders of tracking shares are shareholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors,
and are subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation. We and our subsidiaries each continue to be
responsible for our respective liabilities. Holders of Liberty Global Shares, LiLAC Shares and any other of our capital shares
designated as ordinary shares from time to time will continue to be subject to risks associated with an investment in our
company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares.

      The LiLAC Group comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed
to it (1) LGE Coral Holdco Limited and its subsidiaries, which include CWC, (2) VTR Finance B.V. (VTR Finance) and
its subsidiaries, which include VTR.com SpA (VTR), (3) Lila Chile Holding B.V., which is the parent entity of VTR Finance,
(4) LiLAC Communications Inc., formerly known as LiLAC Holdings Inc. (LiLAC Communications), and its subsidiaries,
which include Liberty Puerto Rico, and (5) prior to July 1, 2015, the costs associated with certain corporate employees of
Liberty Global that are exclusively focused on the management of the LiLAC Group. Effective July 1, 2015, these corporate
employees were transferred to LiLAC Communications. The Liberty Global Group comprises our businesses, assets and
liabilities not attributed to the LiLAC Group, including Virgin Media, Unitymedia, Telenet and UPC Holding, including
our DTH satellite operations based in Luxembourg, our corporate entities (excluding LiLAC Communications), our 50%
interest in VodafoneZiggo and certain other less significant entities.

  Equity Transactions

     From time to time our board of directors authorize various shares repurchase programs. Under these programs, we
receive authorization to acquire up to the specified amount of our ordinary shares or other authorized securities from time
to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include derivative transactions. The timing of
the repurchase of shares or other securities pursuant to our equity repurchase programs, which may be suspended or
discontinued at any time, is dependent on a variety of factors, including market conditions. Pursuant to our share repurchase
programs, during 2016, we repurchased:

                                                                                                                           Aggregate

         * Includes direct acquisition costs and the effects of derivative instruments.

     At December 31, 2016, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares
was $1,943.4 million and $278.6 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our board of directors increased
the amount authorized under the share repurchase program for our Liberty Global Shares by $1.0 billion. For a further
description of our share repurchases, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Narrative Description of Business

     We are a leading international telecommunications company with a commitment to providing our customers the “best
in class” communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers
over our networks and include video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services. We also deliver mobile services
through third-party networks as MVNOs. We design these services to enable our customers to access the digital world on
their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer is “triple-play”, which we use to
describe bundled services of digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by
expanding our services to include mobile services for a “quad-play” or fixed-mobile convergence service in most of our
markets. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been
upgraded for two-way communications. In certain markets, we also offer video services through DTH and fiber-to-the-
home and digital subscriber line (DSL) networks. In addition, in the Caribbean and certain markets in Latin America, we
provide wholesale services over our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks.

     Our operations are attributed to either our Liberty Global Group or our LiLAC Group. The Liberty Global Group
includes our operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. In
terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the U.K. and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania.
The Liberty Global Group also includes our investment in VodafoneZiggo, which operates the largest cable network in the
Netherlands, and in various content businesses.

     The LiLAC Group includes our operations in Chile and Puerto Rico and our CWC operations primarily in the Caribbean
and Latin America, including sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks connecting over 30 markets throughout the
region. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest fixed network capable of delivering video services in each of
Chile, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and five other Caribbean markets. In terms of fixed-line
telephony subscribers, we operate the largest telephony network in each of Panama, Jamaica, Barbados, Bahamas and in
almost all of our other Caribbean countries where we provide retail services.

     In connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate
citizen—that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address
these issues, we strengthen our company and positively influence the communities in which we operate. This includes
enhancing the energy efficiency of all our operations, with a focus on energy use, carbon emissions and management of
electronic waste. We also recognize that coding skills are essential to our industry and other technology-based jobs of the
future. As a result, we have partnered with the CoderDojo Foundation, a global community of free coding clubs for children
age 7-17. Our support for CoderDojo is enabling the next generation of creators, improving their long-term career prospects.
Corporate responsibility is a key part of our business strategy.

__________________
 (1)   Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without
       materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change
       based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. Due to the fact that we do
       not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 11 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s
       partner networks.

 (2)   Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way
       services, including video, internet and telephony services.

 (3)   Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we
       count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU
       counts include equivalent billing unit (EBU) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts.
       For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer Relationships generally
       are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and
       a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from
       Customer Relationships.

 (4)   RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber
       (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs.
       For example, if a residential customer in our Austrian market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service
       and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video,
       DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does
       not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises
       (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or
       telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers
       are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after
       their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees)
       generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this
       regard, our December 31, 2016 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

 (5)   Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
       broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service
       that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes conditional access security cards
       or “smart cards”, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception
       of RGUs that we count on an EBU basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets
       in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is
       counted as two RGUs. In Europe, we have approximately 164,900 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis,
       representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.

 (6)   Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
       broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that
       requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted
       on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises
       is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate
       customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our
       Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks
       receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations.

 (7)   DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast
       directly via a geosynchronous satellite.

 (8)   Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks,
       or that we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude 45,700 and 45,600 DSL subscribers within Belgium
       and Austria, respectively, who are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive
       services from dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers
       without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 97,400 subscribers who have requested and
       received this service.

 (9)   Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks,
       or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our Telephony Subscribers
       exclude 34,900 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to
       our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include
       88,900 subscribers who have requested and received this service.


                                                                   I-9
  (10)    Mobile Subscriber is an active subscriber identification module (SIM) card in service rather than services provided. For example, if
          a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile Subscriber. Alternatively, a
          subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two
          Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods
          of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country.

  (11)    Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned
          by third-party cable operators (partner networks). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship
          with the customer. At December 31, 2016, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 138,600 Customer Relationships, 290,900
          RGUs, 106,300 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 108,500 Internet Subscribers and 76,100 Telephony Subscribers.

Additional General Notes to Table:

         As a result of our decision to discontinue our Multi-channel Multipoint Distribution System (MMDS) service in Ireland, we have
         excluded subscribers to our MMDS service from our externally reported operating statistics effective January 1, 2016, which resulted
         in a reduction to Homes Passed, RGUs and Customer Relationships in Ireland and Slovakia of 22,000 and 500, respectively.

         Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services.
         Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive
         enhanced service levels along with video, internet or fixed-line telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed
         products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced
         service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications
         operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. With the
         exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for
         external reporting purposes.

         Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including certain commercial and residential multiple
         dwelling units in Europe (with the exception of Germany and Belgium, where we do not count any RGUs on an EBU basis). Our EBUs
         are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk
         residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely
         as a result of changes in rates. In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint, and two-way homes passed reflect the technological
         capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring
         generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital
         lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks.

         While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance
         sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform,
         (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We
         periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported
         on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those
         reviews.

         Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such
         information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

  Video Services

     Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the key foundations of our product offerings in our European markets. Our
cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. Subscribers
to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 60 digital or analog video channels (including a
limited number of high definition (HD) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels. This service also includes video-
on-demand (VoD) access and an electronic programming guide. In our markets where our basic digital service is unencrypted
(Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania), the cost of our digital service is the same cost as the
monthly fee of our analog service. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered
at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services
in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our
channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and
foreign channels.

    We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly
charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio
channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to
one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge.

    Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. We offer limited analog
services in all of our broadband markets, except in the U.K. and Switzerland. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to
upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital
service.

    Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services
(bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of
double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services.

     To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with various products that enable our customers to control
when, where and how they watch their programming. These products range from digital video recorders (DVRs) to multimedia
home gateway systems such as "Horizon TV", as well as various mobile applications (apps). Horizon TV is a next generation
multimedia home gateway (decoder box) based on a digital television platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and data
content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view and share,
across multiple devices, linear channels, VoD programming and personal media content and to pause, replay and record
programming. The Horizon TV gateway can act as an internet router that allows access to digital video content available on the
television via other devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets.

     For our Horizon TV subscribers, we offer various features and functionalities, including over 330 television apps for various
online services (such as YouTube, Netflix, social platforms, sports experience, music, news and games). In almost all of our
operations, we also offer an online mobile app for viewing on a second screen called “Horizon Go”. Horizon Go is available on
mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows) and via an internet portal and allows video customers to view linear channels and
VoD, with a substantial part of this content available outside of the home. For Horizon TV customers, when in the home the second
screen device can act as a remote control. Through Horizon Go, customers have the ability to remotely schedule the recording of
a television program on their Horizon TV box at home.

    We offer Horizon TV in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic. In several of our other
European operations, we provide a Horizon TV-like experience through a remote upgrade of the software on the customer’s set-
top box. After the upgrade, these boxes offer several features of the Horizon TV product. We refer to this upgrade as “Horizon
Lite”, although it is locally marketed as Horizon TV, except in Belgium where it is marketed as “Digital TV”. Some of the Horizon
TV features are not available on our Horizon Lite systems, such as recommendation-based content and the ability to access video
content on other devices in the home. We intend to (1) expand the availability of Horizon TV to other markets within our footprint
and (2) continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software updates.

    In the U.K., we offer a multimedia home gateway based on the TiVo platform under a strategic partnership agreement with
TiVo Inc. The TiVo set-top boxes provide television and broadband internet capabilities. In late 2016, we launched a new set-top
box in the U.K. called the Virgin Media V6 box. This device combines ultra high-definition 4K video with improved streaming
functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously
while watching a seventh. Customers can also start watching programming on one television and pick up where they left off on
                                                                I-15
other TiVo boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. A similar box will be rolled out in other
markets in our footprint, where it will carry the next generation Horizon TV user interface and will be marketed under the respective
local brand. In addition to the video service on their TiVo gateway device, our customers in the U.K. also have access to a
comprehensive internet streaming video service called “Virgin TV Anywhere”. This service, which is available via a mobile app
or an internet portal, allows our video customers to stream real-time TV channels and watch VoD content anywhere they have a
broadband connection.

     In Belgium, the digital video product offered by Telenet is based on system marketed as Digital TV platform. It functions
similar to our Horizon Lite service and is available to Telenet's enhanced video subscribers for no additional charge. Digital TV
set-top boxes offer a Horizon-like user interface that allows Telenet's enhanced video customers to remotely manage their DVR,
view programs remotely (up to seven days after the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or tablet in or
out of the home. Telenet also offers customers access to live TV streaming and various other content sources such as VoD via the
“Yelo Play” app, which is available via iOS, Android and Windows smart phones and tablets.

     One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Replay TV records virtually all programs across numerous linear channels in
the countries where this service is available. The recordings are available up to seven days after the original broadcast. This allows
our customers to catch up on their favorite television shows without having to set their DVR or browse separate menus on their
set-top boxes. Instead, customers can open the electronic programing guide, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly.
Replay TV also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Replay
TV is accessible in Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through Horizon TV or
Horizon Lite, and in some of our European markets also via Horizon Go. At the 2016 Content Innovation Awards, Liberty Global,
together with its former subsidiary Ziggo Group Holding (now part of VodafoneZiggo), received the Pay TV Initiative for the Year
Award for its Replay TV service.

     In most of our markets, we offer pay-per-view programming through VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies
and television series. In several of our European markets, our subscription VoD service “MyPrime” is available for an additional
fee with our basic video services and is included in our enhanced video services accessed through the Horizon TV platform.
MyPrime is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. In Germany,
subscription VoD is available through a partnership with Maxdome GmbH, and in Belgium, the service is marketed under “Play”
and “Play More”. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and
international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, the BBC, Warner TV and Sony,
among others.

     Our VoD services, including catch-up TV, are available on a subscription basis or a transaction basis, depending on the tier
of enhanced video service selected by the subscriber. Customers who subscribe to an extended digital tier generally receive a VoD
enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. The subscription-based VoD service includes various programming,
such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and television series.

     Subscribers access our enhanced video service by renting a set-top box with a smart card from our operators, or without a
set-top box if a subscriber is only using our basic video service. Where Horizon TV is available, a subscriber to our enhanced
video services has the option, for an incremental monthly charge, to upgrade the standard digital set-top box to a Horizon TV box
(which has HD DVR capabilities and other additional features). No set-top box or smart card, however, is required to receive our
basic digital services in our unencrypted footprints. In addition, expanded channel packages and premium channels and services
are available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.

  WiFi and Internet Services

    Connectivity is a building block for vibrant communities. As the largest international cable company, our fiber-rich broadband
network is the backbone of our business and the basis of our connectivity strategy. To meet our customers’ expectations to be
seamlessly connected, we are investing in the expansion of our broadband network, mobile and WiFi solutions and customer
premises equipment.

     Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy
services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our
markets. Our residential subscribers in Europe access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices,
or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 10
Mbps in Germany to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. The speed
of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. In addition, by leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband
networks and our Network Extension programs, we are well positioned to deliver gigabit services in our European markets. To

                                                                I-16
this end, by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology, we have the potential to extend our download speeds to at
least 1 Gbps when fully deployed. DOCSIS technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data
transmission over a cable system. Currently, our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.0 technology.

     Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. We offer value-added broadband services
in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and
spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. In many of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services with
internet access as described below. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In
addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may
be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed,
market conditions and other factors.

    In late 2015, we introduced the "Connect Box", a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior in-home WiFi coverage.
The Connect Box is our next generation WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast
broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. It has an automatic WiFi optimization
function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-installed and allows
customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our Connect Box is available in all our European markets. Robust wireless
connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on
multiple devices.

     In almost all of our European markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi),
which provides a secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point
(WiFi modem) in the Connect Box, the set-top box or the Horizon TV box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is
created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. Use of the Community WiFi
does not affect the internet speeds of our customers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network
used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. Access is free for our
internet customers. At December 31, 2016, we had 5.3 million WiFi access points in our Liberty Global Group footprint. In addition,
our internet customers continue to have access to the Community WiFi in the Netherlands. We continue to expand our Community
WiFi service throughout our European markets.

     In the U.K., Virgin Media’s customers have access to an extensive network of public WiFi access points, including in the
London underground train stations. Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public
places) are also available to Unitymedia customers in Germany and to Telenet customers in Belgium. In Switzerland, Belgium,
Hungary, Poland, Ireland and Romania, we are expanding our Community WiFi through access points covering public places. Our
Community WiFi is branded as “Wi-Free” in most of our markets. Through an agreement with Comcast Corporation, our internet
customers will also have access to millions of WiFi access points in the U.S. and across various European countries for no additional
cost.

  Mobile Services

     Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. We offer mobile
services as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary.
Following the February 2016 acquisition of BASE, Telenet became a mobile network provider in Belgium and plans to migrate
its current and future mobile subscribers to the BASE network prior to the termination of its MVNO agreement with a third-party
provider at the end of 2018. We plan to add MVNO arrangements and, where appropriate, acquire or partner with mobile service
providers with their own networks in all our broadband communication markets.

     In Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and, through 2018, Belgium, we provide our mobile telephony services as full
MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints of our country operations.
All of these operations lease the third-party’s radio access network and own the core network, including switching, backbone and
interconnections. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build
and operate a cellular radio tower network. Beginning in 2017, our mobile operations in the U.K. will move from a light MVNO
to a full MVNO arrangement due to a revised agreement with the third-party network provider. In Germany, we provide mobile
telephony as a light MVNO. In this case, we lease the core network as well as the radio access network from a mobile network
operator. This arrangement permits our German customers to have access to the third-party mobile communications services while
we maintain the customer relationship.

    Where mobile services are available subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is combined
with our fixed-line telephony service or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. We offer our customers

                                                                I-17
the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in the U.K., Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary, make such purchase
pursuant to a contract independent of their mobile services contract. We refer to these arrangements as split contracts.

    We typically charge a one-time activation fee to our customers for each SIM card. Our mobile services typically include voice,
short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a
postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for
periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months, with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile
handset. In Belgium, Switzerland and Austria, however, our postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the
U.K. and Belgium, we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime
or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double-or triple-play bundle
receive a discount on their mobile service fee.

  Telephony Services

    Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in most of our
broadband communication markets. In the U.K. and Hungary, we also provide traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We
pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and
receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points.

     Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination
with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and
various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited
off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a
personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost.

  Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks

     Almost two-thirds of Unitymedia’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia has the billing relationship
with the landlord or housing association or with a third-party (Professional Operator) that operates and administers the in-building
network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements allow Unitymedia to offer its digital video, broadband
internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the end customer. Professional Operators may procure the basic video signals
from Unitymedia at volume-based discounts and will generally resell them to housing associations with whom the operator
maintains the customer relationship. Unitymedia has entered into agreements with Professional Operators, such as Tele Columbus
Multimedia GmbH, that allow Unitymedia to market its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly
to the Professional Operator’s subscriber base.

     Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium
(the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its
services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship
with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use
substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on
September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional
information on the PICs Agreement, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

    For approximately two-thirds of the basic video subscribers in UPC Holding’s Switzerland operations (UPC Switzerland),
UPC Switzerland maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the
tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages
service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from UPC
Switzerland, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.

     UPC Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of
those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC Switzerland. UPC Switzerland has the direct customer
billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC Switzerland to offer some or all of its enhanced video, broadband
internet and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland’s service operating contracts have
expanded the addressable markets for UPC Switzerland’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products
directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from
those subscribers. UPC Switzerland also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its
partner networks.


                                                               I-18
  Business Services

    In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our European operations. For business and public
sector organizations, we provide a range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile and
converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and
medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators.

     Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services,
including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories:

    •    VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options;
    •    data services for internet access, virtual private networks and high capacity point-to-point services;
    •    wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;
    •    video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries; and
    •    value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled software.

Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred
provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.

     Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of
services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market
prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more
advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers,
we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year.

  Investments—VodafoneZiggo

     We own a 50% interest in VodafoneZiggo, which has a nationwide integrated broadband and mobile network in the Netherlands.
In connection with the formation of VodafoneZiggo, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Vodafone providing for the
governance of VodafoneZiggo, including decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete
provisions. It also provides for restrictions on transfer of interests in VodafoneZiggo and exit arrangements. Under the dividend
policy, VodafoneZiggo is required to distribute all unrestricted cash to Vodafone and us, subject to minimum cash requirements
and financing arrangements. We also entered into a framework agreement with VodafoneZiggo to provide access to each partner’s
expertise in the telecommunications business. For additional information on the above agreements, see note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The fiber-rich broadband network of VodafoneZiggo passes 7.1 million homes. VodafoneZiggo also offers nationwide mobile
coverage. At December 31, 2016, VodafoneZiggo had nearly 14.8 million subscribers of which 4.0 million were video, 3.2 million
were high-speed broadband, 2.5 million were fixed-line telephony and 5.1 million were mobile. In addition to its residential
services, VodafoneZiggo offers extensive business services throughout the Netherlands. The operations of VodafoneZiggo are
subject to various regulations, which are described below under Regulatory Matters--Europe--The Netherlands.

     VodafoneZiggo customers continue to have access to Ziggo Group Holding’s Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed
as Ziggo TV), including Replay TV, 300 Mbps nationwide broadband internet and an extensive WiFi Community network. They
also have access to Vodafone’s nationwide long-term evolution wireless service, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE)
services, under either a prepaid or postpaid service plan. With its mobile services, VodafoneZiggo is able to offer its customers
quad-play bundles and plans to market converged services in 2017 to residential and business customers.

     Digital subscribers of VodafoneZiggo may subscribe to premium channels and VoD services, including catch-up television,
on a subscription or transaction basis. Its premium channels include sports channels from Ziggo Sport Totaal. It also owns the
Ziggo Sport channel, which is available exclusively to VodafoneZiggo customers. In addition to Horizon TV, VodafoneZiggo also
offers its customers a cloud-based interactive television service using existing set-top boxes. By combining IP protocol with the
standard set-top box, devices without built-in hardware functionality for interactivity can make use of interactive services through
the VodafoneZiggo cable network.

    VodafoneZiggo offers multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 40 Mbps to an ultra high-
speed internet service of either 150 Mbps or 300 Mbps. The speed of service depends on the tier of service selected. Its internet
service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. It also offers value-added broadband services, which include
security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. VodafoneZiggo
                                                               I-19
also offers mobile broadband services. Its customers have access to the Community WiFi in the Netherlands and in our European
footprint.

     VodafoneZiggo also offers multi-feature telephony services. This service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for
line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling,
unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, value added services,
such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line, are available.

     For all its services, VodafoneZiggo competes primarily with the provision of similar services from the incumbent
telecommunications operator Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (1) internet protocol television (IPTV) over fiber optic
lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is
referred to herein as FTTx) networks and through broadband internet connections using DSL or very high-speed DSL technology
(VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (2) digital terrestrial television (DTT), and (3) LTE services. Where KPN
has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of 100 Mbps or 200 Mbps and on its FTTx
networks, it offers download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Its ability to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and
telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services, creates significant competitive pressure on VodafoneZiggo’s operations,
including the pricing and bundling of its video products. KPN’s video services include many of the interactive features
VodafoneZiggo offers its subscribers and KPN is currently testing a new set-top box that is expected to enhance the video experience
for its customers. In addition, KPN has its own over-the-top (OTT) video service. Portions of VodafoneZiggo’s network have
been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue.

__________________
  (1)     Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without
          materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change
          based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count home passed for DTH.

  (2)     Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way
          services, including video, internet and telephony services.

  (3)     Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we
          count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include EBU
          adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU
          calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis.
          Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally
          will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Customer Relationships.

  (4)     RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber
          (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs.
          For example, if a residential customer in our Chilean market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service
          and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video,
          DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does
          not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises
          (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or
          telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers
          are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after
          their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees)
          generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this
          regard, our December 31, 2016 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

  (5)     Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
          broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service
          that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or
          virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU
          basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as
          one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs.

  (6)     Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
          broadband network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-
          enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis. For
          example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one
          subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced
          video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers.

  (7)     DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast
          directly via a geosynchronous satellite.

  (8)     Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks.
          Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections.

  (9)     Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks.
          Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers.

  (10)    Mobile Subscriber is an active SIM card in service rather than services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data
          and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan
          for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not
          pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days,
          based on industry standards within the respective country.

Additional General Notes to Table:

         Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services.
         Certain of our business service revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels
         along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
         subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium
         prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services
         provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. SOHO customers of CWC are not included in our

                                                                      I-22
respective RGU and customer counts as of December 31, 2016. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally
do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and
commercial establishments, such as bars, hotels and hospitals, in Chile and Puerto Rico. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing
the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for
the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates.

While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance
sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform,
(3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We
periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported
on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those
reviews.

Subscriber information for acquired entities, including CWC, is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our
review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

LiLAC Group Products and Services

     Our LiLAC Group has broadband operations predominately in Latin America and the Caribbean serving residential and
business customers. Our sub-sea network, together with our fixed-line networks and mobile platforms, allow us to offer end-to-
end communications to customers. In Puerto Rico, our network includes a fiber ring around the island that is over 400 miles long,
which provides enhanced interconnectivity points to the island’s other local and international telecommunications companies.
These communication networks enable us to offer business services and wholesale services throughout the Caribbean and in parts
of Latin America. These networks also support our offers of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile in our
residential markets. Our services are provided through VTR in Chile, Liberty Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico and CWC in the Caribbean
and parts of Latin America and the Seychelles. The operations of CWC are provided through various consolidated subsidiaries,
including the following subsidiaries where we own less than 100%: Cable & Wireless Panama, SA (a 49.0%-owned entity that
owns most of our operations in Panama), the Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns
all of our operations in the Bahamas), Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited (an 82.0%-owned entity that owns the majority of our
operations in Jamaica) and Cable & Wireless Barbados Limited (an 81.1%-owned entity that owns the majority of our operations
in Barbados).

  Residential Services

    For our residential customers, we offer a comprehensive set of converged consumer mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband
and video services primarily across the Caribbean and Latin America regions as summarized in the table below:

     We offer mobile services throughout most of our Latin America and Caribbean footprint and in the Seychelles. We are a
mobile network provider in Panama and most of our Caribbean markets, including the Bahamas and Jamaica. As a mobile network
provider, we are able to offer a full range of voice and data services, including value-added services such as SMS, mobile internet
and email access. This also provides us with the basis to offer our customers extensive converged products where we also offer
video, internet and fixed-line telephony giving customers connectivity in and out of the home. For these mobile services we hold
spectrum licenses with terms ranging from 10 to 15 years. In Chile we provide mobile services as an MVNO where VTR leases
a third-party's radio access network. This arrangement permits us to offer our customers in Chile mobile services without having
to own and operate a cellular radio tower network.



                                                                                            I-27
     Subscribers to our mobile services pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is included with one
of our other services or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. Our mobile services are available on
a postpaid or prepaid basis with most customers purchasing a prepaid plan. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile
handsets with purchase terms typically related to whether the customer selects a prepaid or postpaid plan. Customers selecting a
prepaid plan or service pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally do not enter into a minimum
contract term. Customers subscribing to a postpaid plan generally enter into contracts ranging from 12 to 24 months. The long-
term contracts are often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. For each SIM card, we typically charge a one-time activation
fee to our prepaid customers. Calls within and out of network incur a separate charge if not covered within a prepaid plan or under
a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services include voice, SMS and internet access.

     CWC is the incumbent fixed-line telephony service provider in many of its Caribbean markets and in certain markets the sole
fixed-line provider. CWC offers multi-feature telephony service over its various fixed networks, including cable, DSL, FTTx and
copper networks. Depending on location, these services are provided via either circuit-switched telephony or VoIP technology.
As the need arises, we are replacing obsolete switches with VoIP technology and older copper networks with modern fiber optics.
In addition, we continue to develop and invest in new technologies that will enhance our customers’ experiences. These digital
telephony services range from usage-based to unlimited international, local and domestic services.

     We offer video services in Chile, Puerto Rico, and in most of our CWC residential markets, including Panama, Jamaica,
Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and the Bahamas. To meet the demands of our customers, we have enhanced our video services
with next generation, market leading digital television platforms that enable our customers to control when and where they watch
their programming. These advanced services are delivered over our FTTx and hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks and include an
advanced electronic programming guide, DVRs and VoD. In certain of our markets, customers can pause their programming even
while the live broadcast is in progress.

     In most of our markets, customers have access to VoD, which offers thousands of movies and other video content, such as
kids, documentaries, adult, sports and television series, as well as music channels. Our VoD service is available on a transaction
basis with certain VoD content available only through premium packages for an additional monthly charge. Customers who
subscribe to our video service receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. We tailor our VoD services
to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. We continue to develop our VoD
services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E
Networks, NBC/Universal, Discovery and Turner Broadcasting, among others.

     In Chile, we recently launched Horizon TV through an advanced, cloud-based platform. For customers who take Horizon TV,
we offer over 20 apps for various online services (such as YouTube, social platforms and games). In several of our Caribbean
markets, we offer a comprehensive internet streaming video service (marketed as “Flow ToGo”) that allows our video customers
to stream over 50 real-time video channels anywhere they have a broadband connection in and out of the home and on multiple
devices. A video streaming service is also available in Puerto Rico where our video customers can stream over 45 real-time video
channels.

     Our operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. All
digital video services are encrypted and require a set-top box provided by us. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed
monthly fee and generally receive at least 70 video channels, including a limited number of HD channels, and several digital and
analog radio channels. This service includes VoD access and an electronic programming guide. We also offer a variety of premium
channel packages, including HD channels, to meet the special interest of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a
subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels,
including channels in the basic tier of service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more
packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge. In markets where our analog service is available, subscribers to
such video service typically receive fewer channels than subscribers to our basic video service, with the number of channels
dependent on their location. Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service.

     We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on the programing preferences, culture, demographics and
local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, life styles,
news, adult, children, ethnic and foreign channels. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to
expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service. Discounts to
our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundled service of at least any two of the following: video,
internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile. In Chile, we do not bundle our mobile services due to regulatory constraints.

    Our customers are increasingly using online communications. To support our customers’ expectations for seamless
connectivity, we are expanding our networks to make ultrafast broadband available to more people. This includes investment in
                                                            I-28
the convergence of our fixed and mobile data systems and making wireless systems available in the home. In 2016, we improved
the connectivity of over 350,000 homes in Chile, Puerto Rico, Panama and other CWC markets through network extensions and
upgrade projects. In 2017, we intend to improve connectivity to approximately 450,000 homes through network extensions and
upgrades, including migrating customers from legacy copper networks to cable or fiber networks. In addition, in 2016, we deployed
the Connect Box to our subscribers in Chile and Puerto Rico. Connect Box is a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior
in-home WiFi coverage. We plan to expand the availability of this WiFi and telephony gateway to our CWC markets beginning
in 2017.

     The internet speeds we offer is one of our differentiators, as customers spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-
heavy services on multiple devices. As a result, we are continuing to invest in additional bandwidth and technologies to increase
internet speeds throughout our Latin America and Caribbean footprint. In 2016, we increased the top tier internet speed for our
customers in Chile to 160 Mbps and in Puerto Rico to 300 Mbps. In certain areas of Puerto Rico, download speeds of up to 400
Mbps are available. We also increased our broadband internet speeds in the CWC footprint following the deployment of FTTx in
Barbados and upgrades to our networks in Panama and Jamaica. As stated above, we plan to continue the upgrade and expansion
of our fixed networks so that we can deploy high-speed internet service to additional customers in the coming years.

     Our residential subscribers access the internet via DSL over our fixed-line telephony networks or via cable modems connected
to their internet capable devices, including personal computers, or wirelessly via the Connect Box. In each of our markets, we
offer multiple tiers of internet service. The speed of service depends on location and the tier of service selected by our subscriber.
For example, our tiers of service range from 4 Mbps to 300 Mbps in Panama and from 20 Mbps to 100 Mbps in Jamaica and
several of our other Caribbean markets. Higher speeds are available in certain other markets, including up to 1 Gbps in Barbados
and in limited areas of Trinidad & Tobago.

     Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls with value-added services available for
additional incremental charges. Our value-added services include security measures and online storage. Mobile broadband internet
services are also available through our mobile services described above. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee
based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to
an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of
internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors.

  Business Services

     Our business services represent a significant portion of CWC’s revenue, where it is one of the largest business service providers
in the markets in which it operates. We also are one of the largest business service providers in Puerto Rico. We offer connectivity
and wholesale solutions to carriers and businesses throughout the Caribbean and in parts of Latin America. Our sub-sea and

commercial zones, wireless carrier cell sites and customers in key markets within our operating footprint.




                                                                I-29
    Below is a map of our sub-sea fiber network.




     With over 48,000 km of fiber optic cable, and a current capacity of 2.0 Tbps (terabytes per second), CWC is able to carry
large volumes of voice and data traffic on behalf of its customers, businesses and carriers. The networks also allow CWC to provide
point-to-point, clear channel wholesale broadband capacity services, superior switching and routing capabilities and local network
services to telecommunications carriers, internet service providers (ISPs) and large corporations. In case of outages on portions
of the cable systems, the network provides inbuilt resiliency due to the capability of re-routing traffic. CWC is highly regarded
for its wholesale services. In 2016, it was recognized for its innovation and excellence in wholesale services at the 2016 Global
Carrier Awards where it received the Best Caribbean Wholesale Carrier Award for the fourth consecutive year. At the 2016 MEF
Excellence Awards, CWC received the Wholesale Service Provider of the Year Award and the Service Innovation of the Year
Award.

     Our business operations focus on sales to small, medium and international companies and governmental agencies. Within the
business community, we target specific industry segments, such as financial institutions, the hospitality sector, healthcare facilities,
education institutions and government offices. We offer tailored solutions that combine our standard services with value added
features, such as dedicated customer care and enhanced service performance monitoring. Our business products and services
include voice, broadband, enterprise-grade connectivity, data center, hosting and managed solutions, as well as IT solutions. We

telecommunication services include flexible call handling, teleconferencing, voice mail and other premium calling features, as
well as security, surveillance and backup services.

     We work with businesses to customize their IT services based on the needs of the business. For these tailored services we
enter into individual long-term agreements. For SOHO and small business customers, we generally enter into standard service
agreements with contractually established prices based on the size of the business, the services received and the volume and
duration of the services. We also have agreements to provide our services to our business customers over dedicated fiber lines and
third-party fiber networks. Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector
so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy successfully, customer care is a key driver.

Additional Business Information

  Technology

     In most of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber
coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the
home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. In several of our Caribbean markets, these services are transmitted over
a fixed network consisting of FTTx, DSL or copper lines. Approximately 98% of our network allows for two-way communications
and is flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services.

     We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for
instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies
that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:

    •    recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:
                  increasing the number of nodes in our markets;
                  increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;
                  converting analog channels to digital;
                  bonding additional DOCSIS 3.0 channels;
                  deploying VDSL over our fixed telephony network;
                  replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and
                  using digital compression technologies.
    •    freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to
         digital services;
    •    increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud
         storage systems;
    •    enhancing our network to accommodate business services;
    •    using wireless technologies to extend our services outside of the home;
    •    offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets;
    •    expanding the availability of Horizon TV and related products and developing and introducing online media sharing and
         streaming or cloud-based video; and
    •    testing new technologies.

     As stated under General Development of Business—Expansion and Acquisitions above, we are expanding our hybrid fiber
coaxial cable network through our Network Extension programs. For our mobile network operations in the Caribbean and Latin
America, we are acquiring additional spectrum, enabling us to expand our LTE service in the region. In addition, we are seeking
mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a
strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers.

     We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our European markets and most of our
Latin America and Caribbean markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone.
The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration
with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. For our operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, we
deliver our high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our various fixed networks, including cable, DSL, FTTx and copper
networks. These networks are further connected via our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable network that provide connectivity
within and outside the region.

     In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. A majority of our broadband
networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide
these speeds to our subscribers, we are launching our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout
our footprint. The launch of DOCSIS 3.1 technology will allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. Our
Unitymedia operations have already demonstrated that download speeds of 2 Gbps can be achieved on our network. The new
gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over
                                                               I-32
our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of
our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint.

  Supply Sources

    Content. With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the deciding factors for
customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view
programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on:

    •    proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations);
    •    product (delivering the best content available);
    •    procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and
    •    partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).

     We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders,
including broadcasters and cable programming networks. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or
per subscriber basis, with minimum pay guarantees in certain cases. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses with
volume discounts and marketing support. For on-demand programming and streaming services, we generally enter into shorter-
term agreements. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers
through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets.

    In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney, Time
Warner (including HBO), Fox, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private
broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programing through select relationships with companies such as Sky
plc (Sky) (U.K., Ireland, Germany and Austria) and British Telecom (BT). For our VoD services, we license a variety of
programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids and documentaries. In addition, we have entered into a
multi-year revenue sharing arrangement with Netflix Inc. (Netflix) to provide our customers with premium OTT services. The
partnership will result in Netflix's content being available via set-top boxes to our video customers across all of our markets in
Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. The Netflix app is already available to our customers in the U.K., Ireland and Switzerland
and we plan to deploy the service in the rest of our operations via Horizon TV over the course of 2017 and 2018. It is also available
to VodafoneZiggo customers.

    Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We
have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, TV3 Group (Ireland)
and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. In addition, we operate the
leading Caribbean sports network Flow Sports, which provides exclusive full coverage of the English Premier League and other
leading sporting events. We have also launched our own exclusive sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium, and announced the
launch of MySports in Switzerland in 2017.

     In addition, we are commissioning our own dramas. We created the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im Heimatland
and the original Belgium series Chaussee d'Amour. In August 2016, we announced that we are teaming up with All3Media, which
we own jointly with Discovery Communications, Inc., to co-produce four high-end drama series over the next two years. This
exclusive content will be available on demand to our customers.

    Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers
with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes,
modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer
support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer.
Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services.

     Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds,
from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software
licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement
where TiVo is the exclusive provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provides converged
television and broadband internet capabilities, and we are the exclusive distributor of the TiVo services and technology in the U.K.
For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text
messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally
require us to pay based on usage of the services.
                                                                  I-33
     Access Arrangements. Through Unitymedia, we have entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent
telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom), for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as
use of fiber optic transmission systems, towers and facility space. In addition, Unitymedia purchases a portion of the electricity
required for the operation of its networks through Deutsche Telekom under such agreements. Unitymedia’s ability to offer its
broadband communications services to customers is dependent on the agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are
long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions. Any termination, however, would have a material adverse
effect on the operations of Unitymedia. For information on a legal action that Unitymedia commenced against Deutsche Telekom
in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers.
Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers.
We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could
significantly impact our mobile services.

Competition

     All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. Technological advances and product
innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their
telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless
connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component
of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well as
companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant
competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunication services by focusing on customer service, competitive
pricing and offering quality high-speed internet. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the video,
broadband internet, and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide more detail on the competitive
landscape in our more material markets.

  Video Distribution

     Our video services compete primarily with traditional free-to-air (FTA) broadcast television services, DTH satellite service
providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including incumbent telephony operations
offering (1) DTH satellite services, (2) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an
enhancement to VDSL called "vectoring", (3) IPTV over FTTx networks, or (4) LTE Services. Many of these competitors have
a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In
certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems.

    OTT video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant
competitive factor as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO
Go, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from
broadcasters. In some cases, these OTT services are provided free-of-charge. The content library of such services are offered on
an unlimited basis for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. To enhance
our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through
MyPrime or our arrangement with Netflix. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and
entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events.

     We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow
us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed
internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet,
television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available,
our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile
and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects
of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand
is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. In response to the continued growth in OTT viewing, we have launched
a number of innovative video services, including Horizon Go, MyPrime and Replay TV in our European markets, Play More in
Belgium and Flow ToGo in several of the CWC markets, as well as access to Netflix content.




                                                                I-34
     Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and
services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors,
such as Swisscom AG (Swisscom) in Switzerland, have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain sports programs, which
limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive
contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these
companies, including Sky Deutschland AG, a subsidiary of Sky, in Germany and Austria and Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland.
If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers
on selecting a video service.

  Liberty Global Group

     In the European countries in which we operate, our principal competition in the provision of video services is from traditional
FTA broadcasters; DTH satellite providers in many markets, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Ireland, Poland, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia, where we compete with long-established satellite platforms; incumbent telecommunications providers
using fiber technology; and cable operators where portions of our systems have been overbuilt. In addition, in Belgium we are
experiencing competition on our own network as a result of the Belgian Regulatory Authorities granting third-party operators
(including the incumbent telephony operator) access to cable operators’ networks. See Regulatory Matters—Liberty Global Group
—Belgium. Mobile broadband has gained a noticeable share of subscribers, which is another competitive factor.

     Similar to our technological advances to enhance our video services, our competitors are also improving their video platforms
with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. Similarly, VDSL, which is either
provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third-party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of
our markets as are FTTx networks. In all of our European markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent
telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include IPTV over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases, DTH
and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services
and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing
and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers
in a number of our larger European markets are pricing their DTT, VDSL or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price
of the comparable digital cable service and, in some cases, including DVRs as a standard feature.

     Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services
from one provider. In our largest European video markets, our key competitors for the the provision of converged services are:
BT (U.K.), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Each of these
competitors have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced bundled services. As a result, our ability to offer
triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers.
In each of these markets, we seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive services (such as
Replay TV and MyPrime) and our download speeds.

     Portions of our European systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operations. These systems are a
significant competitive factor primarily for our Central and Eastern Europe operations. Based on research of various
telecommunication publications, including by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and internal
estimates, parts of our Central and Eastern Europe operations are overbuilt by FTTx networks, including almost all of our operations
in Romania. Other cable operators have also overbuilt approximately half of our cable networks in Hungary and Poland. Although
we have extensive FTTx overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition,
government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries in which we operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx
networks, creating another source of competition. In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers,
incumbent telecommunications operators are adopting VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient
solution compared to FTTx initiatives. Our primary competitor in Germany, Deutsche Telekom, has implemented this technology
in almost all of our footprint in Germany. Swisscom is also implementing vectoring in Switzerland. Vectoring is a transmission
method that coordinates line signals to reduce crosstalk levels and improve performance. Bonding is a method of taking channels
on either DSL or cable plant and bonding those channels together for a higher bandwidth throughput.

     In most of our Central and Eastern European markets, we face intense competition from DTH services. These DTH companies
offer aggressively-priced packages of video content and in some cases offer triple-play packages. FTA broadcasters are also
significant competitors in the Central and Eastern Europe markets. To stay competitive, UPC Holding’s DTH operations offer
advanced services and functionality, including DVR and premium content, in most of our Central and Eastern European markets.
It has also expanded these services to include a triple-play offer in Hungary. Our cable operations stay competitive by offering
enhanced digital services, such as HD channel offerings, MyPrime, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. These operations
have also increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-play bundles ranging from up to 250 Mbps in Poland to up to 500
Mbps in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options.
                                                               I-35
     We compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television, Replay
TV, multiscreen services and multimedia gateways. We also compete by accelerating the migration of our customers from analog
to digital services, offering advanced digital features and attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable
prices. In each of the countries in which we operate, we also tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer
recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel
offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged
service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as
other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our
Horizon TV product to meet our customers desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and
expanding its availability in our markets.

    •    Virgin Media. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with FTA television and with Sky, the primary
         pay satellite television provider. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play and quad-play services in the U.K. and Ireland.
         Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk) in the U.K. and Eircom Limited in
         Ireland, each of which offer triple-play services, as well as IPTV video services. Each of these competitors have multimedia
         home gateways.

         Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a
         principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels,
         including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and
         online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms.
         Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor
         and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content,
         including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and
         the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks.

         In this competitive market, Virgin Media is expanding its broadband network and recently launched its new 4K enabled
         Virgin Media V6 set-top box in the UK. In Ireland it offers Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as Virgin TV).
         The on-line streaming service Virgin TV Anywhere is available throughout the Virgin Media footprint. In addition, Virgin
         Media’s ability to include mobile for its U.K. and Ireland customers for a low incremental fee creating a fixed-mobile
         convergence bundle is a key market offer.

    •    Unitymedia. Unitymedia’s primary competition is from FTA television received via satellite. Unitymedia’s primary
         competitor for pay TV services is the IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx and DTH of the incumbent telecommunications
         operator, Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has announced plans to cover approximately 80% of German homes
         with its VDSL network by 2018. Within its VDSL footprint, Deutsche Telekom is implementing vectoring technology
         to enhance maximum broadband speeds to up to 100 Mbps from the current speeds of up to 50 Mbps. Deutsche Telekom
         further announced its ambition to implement super vectoring technology across all cable network areas by 2018, enhancing
         broadband speeds in these areas to up to 250 Mbps.

         Deutsche Telekom offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence, and recently became more
         aggressive on price by launching double-play and triple-play promotional offers. In addition, Vodafone, also a competitor
         in Germany, bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche Telekom’s DSL network under a
         resell agreement making it a significant competitor in the double-play and triple-play market in our footprint. It also has
         expanded its bundle offers to include mobile products. These converged offerings may enable Deutsche Telekom and
         Vodafone to reduce churn and attract new customers.

         Deutsche Telekom and Professional Operators compete with Unitymedia for housing association contracts. Professional
         Operators typically procure the broadcast signals they distribute from Unitymedia or from FTA television received via
         satellite. Certain Professional Operators may also use such opportunities to build their own distribution networks or to
         install their own head-ends for receiving satellite signals.

         To enhance its competitive position, Unitymedia offers Horizon TV and the Horizon family of products, including Horizon
         Go. It also makes mobile available creating converged bundles. Mobile customers receive a discount when they also
         subscribe to certain bundles.

    •    Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive
         digital television, replay television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service.
         Proximus offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence. Its IPTV services are delivered over
         its DSL and VDSL networks. Also, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to

                                                                 I-36
         their cable networks. Consequently, Telenet faces increased competition from other providers of video services who may
         be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information, see Regulatory Matters—Liberty Global Group—
         Belgium.

         In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad
         acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality,
         VoD offerings and its Play Sports channel. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its all-in-
         one converged offering “WIGO”. In addition, Telenet continues to enhance its Yelo Play app and programming, including
         extending its rights to the English Premier League through 2019 and the addition of other sports rights. Further, with its
         pending acquisition of certain broadband operations from Coditel Brabant sprl, Telenet will extend its services to additional
         parts of Belgium and Luxembourg.

    •    UPC Switzerland. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which
         provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay
         functionality and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive
         rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom’s internet speeds include up to 100 Mbps on its VDSL network
         and up to either 300 Mbps or 1 Gbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx
         network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its fiber-to-
         the-home network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation
         agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own fiber-to-the-home network. With respect to subscribers on
         partner networks, UPC Switzerland competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these subscribers.

         To compete effectively in Switzerland, UPC Switzerland promotes Horizon TV and its family of products together with
         Replay TV and MyPrime, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences. It
         also uses its high-speed internet of up to 200, 400 or 500 Mbps to promote its extended digital tier bundles.

  LiLAC Group

     In Latin America and the Caribbean, our primary competition in the provision of video services, depending on the market, is
from traditional FTA broadcasters, DTH satellite providers, other pay television providers using fiber technology or cable operators
whose networks overlap our systems. OTT viewing is also a significant competitive factor. To enhance our video offerings in this
region, we are developing cloud-based, next generation user interfaces based on advanced technologies. This is demonstrated by
our recent launch of Horizon TV in Chile and an advanced set-top box in most of CWC’s markets. Our competitors, however, are
also improving their video services with interactive services and wireless connectivity. Many of our competitors offer competitively-
priced packages of video content and, in some cases, offer double- and triple-play packages.

    In this competitive environment, we enhance our offers with advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD channels,
VoD and multiscreen services. In addition, we offer attractive content packages tailored to the particular market and discounts for
bundled services. To improve the quality of the programming in our packages, our operations periodically modify their digital
channel offerings. Where mobile is available, we are focusing on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. We use these
services, as well as bundles of our fixed-line services, as a means of driving video and other products where convenience and price
can be leveraged across the portfolio of services.

    •    VTR. VTR competes primarily with DTH service providers, including the incumbent Chilean telecommunications
         operator Compañia de Telecomunicaciones de Chile SA using the brand name Movistar (Movistar), Claro Chile S.A., a
         subsidiary of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (Claro), and DIRECTV Latin America Holdings, Inc. (DirecTV). Movistar
         offers double-play and triple-play packages using DTH for video and DSL for internet and fixed-line telephony and offers
         mobile services. On a smaller scale, Movistar also offers IPTV services over FTTx networks in Chile. Claro offers triple-
         play packages using DTH and, in most major cities in Chile, through a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. It also offers
         mobile services. To a lesser extent, VTR also competes with video services offered by or over networks of fixed-line
         telecommunication providers using DSL technology. To compete effectively, VTR focuses on enhancing its subscribers
         viewing options in and out of the home. It offers VoD, catch-up television, DVR functionality, Horizon TV and a variety
         of premium channels. These services and its variety of bundled options, including internet and telephony, enhance VTR’s
         competitive position.

    •    CWC. CWC competes with a variety of pay TV service providers in its various markets. Several of these competitors
         offer double-play and triple-play packages. Fixed-mobile convergence services are not yet a significant factor in most of
         CWC’s residential markets. In Panama, CWC competes primarily with Cable Onda S.A., which offers video, internet
         and fixed-line telephony over its cable network. The DTH services of Claro are also a competitive factor. In several of
         CWC’s other markets, including Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago and Barbados, we are the largest or one of the largest video

                                                                 I-37
         service providers. In these markets, CWC’s primary competition is from DTH providers, such as DirecTV, and operators
         of IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx, such as Digicel Group Ltd. (Digicel). To compete effectively, CWC invests in
         leading mobile and fixed networks, and in content, where the Premier League is a main attraction for Flow Sports.

    •    Liberty Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico is the third largest provider of video services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto
         Rico’s primary competition for video customers is from DTH satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network Corporation
         (Dish Network). Dish Network is an aggressive competitor, offering low introductory offers, free HD channels and, in
         its top tier packages, a multi-room DVR service for free. DirecTV is also a significant competitor offering similar
         programming in Puerto Rico compared to Dish Network. In order to compete, Liberty Puerto Rico focuses on offering
         video packages with attractive programming, including HD and Spanish language channels. It also offers a specialty
         video package of Spanish-only channels that is gaining popularity. In addition, Liberty Puerto Rico uses its bundled offers
         that include high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps to drive its video services.

  Internet

     With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving
marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many
of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet
services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product
offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and
businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced
technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks.
In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive
environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers.

     Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying
tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and
packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download internet speeds in Europe range from up to
200 Mbps to speeds of up to 500 Mbps available in Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Our top download speeds for
our Latin American and Caribbean operations generally range from up to 100 Mbps to speeds of up to 350 Mbps. In Barbados,
we also have speeds of up to 1 Gbps available and in Anguilla, we have speeds of up to 480 Mbps. In many of our LiLAC Group
markets, we offer the highest download speeds available via our cable and FTTx networks. The focus is on high-end internet
products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the
internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with
local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level.
With the commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan
to further increase our high-speed internet offers.

  Liberty Global Group

     Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various
DSL-based technologies by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-
line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE,
are also significant competitors using high-speed mobile networks. We are expanding our ultra high-speed services and increasing
our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that
include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Mobile data is also increasingly important and we are addressing this
through our wide range of mobile products, including expanding our LTE service area and offering SIM-only mobile products, as
well as expanding our Community WiFi network.

    •    Virgin Media. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services,
         including fixed-line incumbent telecommunications providers. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest,
         which provides broadband internet access services over its own VDSL network. BT has announced its intention to rollout
         ultrafast speeds of up to 300 Mbps to 500 Mbps by the end of 2020 to up to 10.0 million premises using G-fast technology,
         a DSL standard designed for local loops less than 250 meters. This technology is also expected to eventually support a
         rollout of 1 Gbps service.

         Operators such as Sky and TalkTalk deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known
         as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing
         the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital
         investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition
                                                                I-38
         and pricing pressure in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such
         as LTE mobile services and WiFi services, is significant. Mobile providers continue to gain market share from fixed-line
         providers. These providers offer a range of mobile services.

    •    Unitymedia. In Germany, the competition for broadband internet services is particularly intense. For broadband internet
         access, DSL is the dominant technology and Deutsche Telekom is the primary provider. Other major competitors to our
         services are resellers of Deutsche Telekom’s DSL and VDSL services. We also face increased competition from mobile
         broadband operators, including Deutsche Telekom, and other network providers, many of which offer mobile services
         through LTE wireless systems and are increasing their coverage areas. Deutsche Telekom is upgrading its VDSL network
         with vectoring technology to increase its speeds to up to 100 Mbps. It plans to have 80% of German households connected
         to this network by 2018. With its (vectored) VDSL expansion plan, competition from Deutsche Telekom will increase.

    •    Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services.
         Telenet’s primary competitor is the DSL service provider Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering
         quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and VDSL service provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Mobile internet use is
         increasing as well. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other
         providers who have access to Telenet’s cable network. In this competitive market, Telenet is using its fixed-mobile
         converged offer “WIGO” to promote its internet and other services.

    •    UPC Switzerland. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is our primary
         competitor. Swisscom internet customers have access to its basic video content free of charge through its internet portal.
         It is also expanding its FTTx network and rolling out G.fast technology. At year end 2016, it had 2.5 million new connections
         through these technologies. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from 20 Mbps to up to 1 Gbps.

  LiLAC Group

    In several of our CWC markets, we are the incumbent phone company offering broadband internet products using various
DSL-based technologies. In these markets and our other Latin American markets, our key competition for internet services is from
cable and IPTV operators and mobile data service providers. Wireless broadband services are a significant competitor with their
high-speed mobile networks. To compete effectively, we are expanding our LTE service areas and increasing our download
speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service through bundled offerings that include video and fixed-line telephony.
We also offer a wide range of mobile products either on a prepaid or postpaid basis.

    •    VTR. In Chile, VTR faces competition primarily from non-cable-based ISPs, such as Movistar, and from other cable-
         based providers, such as Claro. Competition is particularly intense with each of these companies offering competitively
         priced services, including bundled offers with ultra high-speed internet services. Mobile broadband competition is
         significant as well. Both Movistar and Claro have launched an LTE network for high-speed mobile data. To compete
         effectively, VTR is expanding its two-way coverage and offering attractive bundling with fixed-line telephony and digital
         video service. In response to the availability of mobile data in Chile, VTR offers our high-speed internet with download
         speeds of up to 160 Mbps.

    •    CWC. CWC competes primarily with mobile broadband providers in the provision of internet services. Where CWC is
         the incumbent telecommunications provider, it also competes with cable operators, the largest of which is Cable Onda
         in Panama and Cable Bahamas in the Bahamas. To a lesser extent, CWC experiences competition from Digicel in certain
         of its markets. To distinguish itself from these competitors, CWC uses its bundled offers with video and telephony to
         promote its broadband internet services.

    •    Liberty Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, Liberty Puerto Rico competes primarily with mobile broadband providers. Most of
         these providers, including the incumbent telecommunications company, offer these services over their LTE networks. To
         compete with mobile broadband, Liberty Puerto Rico offers its high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 300
         Mbps. Liberty Puerto Rico also competes with the DSL services of Claro in providing fixed-line internet services.

  Mobile and Telephony Services

     Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In almost all of our Latin America and Caribbean markets we are
either the leading or one of the leading mobile providers, except in Chile and certain other markets where we are a relatively new
entrant in the provision of mobile services. In Belgium, we are one of the top three mobile providers and in the U.K., we are the
fourth largest provider, in each case based on number of SIM cards. In our other European markets, however, we currently have
minimal mobile presence. In the markets where we are one of the top mobile providers, we continue to seek additional bandwidth
to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and increase our LTE services. Where we are a small mobile provider, we
face significant competition from other mobile telephony providers, many of whom offer LTE services and are making significant
advances in obtaining customers. In all of our markets competition is intense. We also offer various calling plans, such as unlimited
network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile
phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers.
Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver. In several of our markets we provide converged services,
including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in our other markets
and mobility applications to our other services.

     The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by
the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. In several
of our CWC markets, we are the incumbent telecommunications provider with long established customer relationships. In our
other markets, our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in the applicable
market. In these markets, the operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services,
greater resources to devote to the provision of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In all of
our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. OTT telephony is also a competitive
factor. In many countries, our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or
other indirect access providers.

     Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends,
the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth
of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other regulatory action, such as general price
competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using
the incumbent’s network. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as
“anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the
needs of our subscribers. In many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to
make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer
needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help
promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard.

  Liberty Global Group

    Across Europe, our fixed-line and mobile telephony businesses are generally small compared to the existing business of the
incumbent telephone companies. The incumbent telecommunication companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators
and other VoIP operators, including ISPs, offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets.
Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive.

     Due to the maturity of the telephony market, competition is particularly intense in all our markets with price often the deciding
factor. To maintain or increase market share, we and our competitors focus on bundling telephony services with quality broadband
offerings and other services. In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of
which also have competitive mobile offers based on LTE services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers
are BT (UK), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are
also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards, except in Germany where Telefonica O2 is the
largest.

  LiLAC Group

    In our Latin American and Caribbean markets, competition in the telephony and mobile services markets is also intense. In
Chile, VTR faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications operator, Movistar, and other telecommunications operators.
Movistar has substantial experience in providing telephony services, resources to devote to the provision of telephony services
and long-standing customer relationships. Price is a key factor as are bundles with quality services. We distinguish our services
by delivering reliable market leading internet access speeds with attractive bundled offers.

                                                                I-40
     Movistar, Claro and Entel PCS Telecommunications SA are the primary companies that offer mobile telephony in Chile. In
mid-2015, WOM S.A. entered the mobile services market through its acquisition of the Nextel Chile network. WOM S.A. is
exerting significant competitive pressure in the mobile market with its very aggressive price offer. Such pricing is driving down
sales and increasing churn in the mobile market. As an MVNO, VTR offers its mobile services on a standalone basis. To attract
and retain customers, VTR focuses on its triple-play customer base, offering them postpaid mobile accounts at an attractive price.

     With respect to mobile services, we face competition from Digicel in most of our CWC residential markets and Movistar and
Claro in Panama. In addition, in the Bahamas, where CWC had previously been the only provider of mobile services, competition
has increased significantly due to the commercial launch of mobile services by a competitor during the fourth quarter of 2016. We
also face competition in the provision of broadband services from Cable Onda in Panama, Digicel in our Caribbean markets and
Cable Bahamas in the Bahamas. These companies all have competitive pricing on similar services and Digicel is also able to offer
fixed-mobile convergence with its video, internet, mobile and telephony services. To attract and retain customers, CWC focuses
on providing quality services and premium content, as well as converged services where customers can access content in and out-
of-the home.

Regulatory Matters

  Overview

    Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in
which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in
European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union (E.U.).

     Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed
on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and
the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In
addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions,
interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties.
Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

  Liberty Global Group

     Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the E.U. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain of their
laws with certain E.U. rules. In addition, other types of E.U. rules are directly enforceable in those countries without any
implementation at the national level. Certain E.U. rules are also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member
States are the E.U. Member States (excluding Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

     On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved, on an advisory basis, an exit from the E.U. commonly
referred to as “Brexit”. The terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the
British government formally initiates a withdrawal process pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on Europe. The British government
has indicated that it plans to trigger Article 50 and commence negotiations to determine the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from
the E.U. by the end of March 2017. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and
people and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt
trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations (including the U.S.) as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. The
initial impact of the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets, including in the prices of our
shares, as well as significant currency fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency)
against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, namely the British pound sterling and the euro. The effects of Brexit
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

    In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive E.U.-level legislative action. As a result, most of
the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been
developed by the E.U. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the E.U. and is not part of the European Economic
Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulation in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may
have a material impact on our business.




                                                                I-41
  E.U. Communications Regulation

     The body of E.U. law that deals with communications regulation consists of a variety of legal instruments and policies
(collectively, the Regulatory Framework). The key elements of the Regulatory Framework are various legal measures and
directives that require Member States to harmonize their laws, as well as certain other instruments and regulations that have direct
effect without any specific adoption at the national level.

     The Regulatory Framework primarily seeks open communication services in markets within Europe. It harmonizes the rules
within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional
telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony, internet and, to some degree, television
services.

    On December 18, 2009, the Official Journal of the E.U. published revisions to the Regulatory Framework. These revisions
should have been transposed into the laws of the Member States before May 25, 2011, although in practice, this process is still
ongoing in certain Member States.

     Certain key provisions included in the current Regulatory Framework (including additional revisions since adoption) are set
forth below. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all regulation in this area.

    •    Licensing and Exclusivity. The Regulatory Framework requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication
         networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple registration. The Regulatory
         Framework sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and services.
         Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of regulation,
         environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of
         customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations.

    •    Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Regulatory Framework apply only to operators or
         service providers with “Significant Market Power” (defined below) in a relevant market. For example, the provisions
         of the Access Directive allow the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) in E.U. Member States to mandate certain access
         obligations only for those operators and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For purposes
         of the Regulatory Framework, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have Significant Market Power where,
         either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength affording it the power to
         behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers.

         As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Regulatory Framework, each Member State’s NRA is required
         to analyze certain markets predefined by the E.U. Commission to determine if any operator or service provider has
         Significant Market Power. Initially starting with 18 predefined markets, the E.U. Commission has currently recommended
         that there be four such predefined markets, which are subject to periodic review. NRAs may, however, continue to maintain
         their analysis of some of the markets from the previous list or perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation,
         which requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met.

         NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power in any of these predefined markets or they may define
         and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market,
         an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Regulatory Framework, the E.U. Commission has the power
         to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect
         to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by the E.U. Commission or an additional
         market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate
         and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible. In particular, we have been found to have Significant
         Market Power in the market for termination of calls on our network.

    •    Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by
         the Regulatory Framework. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable
         must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are
         required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and be transparent and subject to
         periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all European markets in which we operate. Must carry
         regulations are significantly different among Member States. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe
         is allowable under the Regulatory Framework. To date, however, the E.U. Commission has taken very limited steps to
         enforce E.U. law in this area, leaving must carry obligations intact in certain Member States. We do not expect the E.U.
         Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.


                                                                 I-42
    •    Net Neutrality/Traffic Management. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-
         wide net neutrality regime. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, permits the provision of
         specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects operators to reasonable traffic management requirements.
         The regulation also abolishes roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017.

     On August 30, 2016, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) issued guidelines for
implementation of the regulation. Although the guidelines are non-binding, they represent the official base on which NRAs may
interpret the regulation.

    Regarding roaming, in order to ensure a smooth transition of the abolition of roaming surcharges in 2017, the regulation
provided for a transition period beginning April 2016. During the transition period, surcharges are not to exceed the regulated
maximum wholesale charges. In a simultaneous legislative process the E.U. Commission is expected to review the regulation on
wholesale roaming charges in the first quarter of 2017.

     On May 6, 2015, the E.U. Commission published its Digital Single Market strategy document. The strategy is an aggregation
of many different policy areas with the purpose of creating a digital single market to expand jobs and stimulate growth. The strategy
includes policy review in the areas of E.U. communications regulation, broadcasting law, copyright reform and anti-competitive
geo-blocking practices.

     On September 14, 2016, the E.U. Commission published a proposal for the European Electronic Communications Code, which
would replace the Regulatory Framework. The proposal recognizes the need for greater incentives to boost private sector investment
in very high capacity networks. The proposal maintains the key elements of the Regulatory Framework, notably market analysis
with remedies only being imposed on operators with Significant Market Power. The proposal captures all types of services that
are relevant to consumers, not only the traditional electronic communication services as captured under the Regulatory Framework
but also OTT services. The proposal brings greater harmonization to the timetables for spectrum licensing and renewal that will
encourage investment in mobile networks and will result in more advanced services. The adoption of the proposal for the European
Electronic Communications Code and its implementation in to national laws by Member States is not expected before the third
quarter of 2018.

  Broadcasting Law

     Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Regulatory Framework, the activities
of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of E.U. law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS).
Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member
State. Pursuant to AVMS, however, E.U. Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in
another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their
home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to non-
linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we should be able, if we so elect, to offer our own VoD services across the European
Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could structure our business to have a single
regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network,
it should be the business of the third-party, in its capacity as provider of the services, and not us as the local distributor, that is
regulated in respect of these services.

    Although Member States were obligated to transpose the requirements of AVMS into national law, and this has generally been
completed, the practical effect is still not clear. Uncertainty still remains about the proper treatment of VoD from a practical
perspective. Thus, there can be no assurance that the requirements for VoD will operate in the manner described above in any
individual Member State. As a result, we may face inconsistent and uncertain regulation of our VoD service in Europe.

    AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European
producers who are independent of broadcasters.

     As part of its Digital Single Market strategy, on May 25, 2016 the E.U. Commission published a proposal for the revision of
the AVMS. The proposal maintains the key elements of AVMS - notably the country of origin principle and European works quota.
The adoption of the proposal for the revision of the AVMS is expected in the second half of 2017. Once adopted, its implementation
into national laws by Member States is proposed to take place no later than 12 months thereafter.

     Under the Digital Single Market strategy, in December 2015, the E.U. Commission published a proposal for a regulation
addressing the portability of online audiovisual content services. Under the proposal, providers of online audiovisual content
services must allow subscribers who are temporarily present in any E.U. Member State to access and use those services. The
intention of the proposed regulation is for subscribers to be able to enjoy the same out-of-home service in another Member State.
                                                                 I-43
The adoption of the proposed regulation is not expected until the second half of 2017, and would become effective within 9 to12
months after adoption.

  Other European Level Regulation

     In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our European operating companies must comply with both
specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention and electronic commerce. In December 2015, the
E.U. approved the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to data protection and retention. The GDPR
enhanced existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes stiff penalties for organizations that fail to comply.
The GDPR will be directly applicable in all Member States commencing in 2018. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR,
the E.U. Commission published on January 11, 2017 a proposal for an e-Privacy regulation, replacing today’s e-Privacy Directive
that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. The adoption of this proposal is not expected before
June 2018.

     Our European operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on
consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the E.U. level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their
services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such
as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the
degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages.

     The E.U. Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy
consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and
studies regarding energy consumption with the E.U. Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we are
working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software
to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to
create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation, which has been formally recognized
by the E.U. Commission. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the
functionality of equipment we deploy to customers.

     Pursuant to a Regulation on standby power effective January 7, 2010 (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required
to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. For this
purpose, our set-top boxes and certain other equipment are equipped with an off switch. Beginning in January 2013, the Standby
Regulation imposed further requirements on power management on certain devices we purchase and/or develop. These devices,
namely the Horizon TV set-top box and any future set-top boxes, must comply with such requirements, unless it can be argued
such further requirements are inappropriate. These additional requirements have necessitated additional software developments
for our equipment and reduces the functionality of our equipment, assuming the equipment’s default setting is maintained.

    Furthermore in August 2013, the E.U. Commission issued an amendment to the Standby Regulation called Networked Standby
(No 801/2013), which became effective as of January 1, 2015, with the aim of regulating, among others, the maximum power
consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called Networked Standby mode. These additional requirements
may have an impact on our costs and the customer experience.

     As part of the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television
has been approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the
700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum will become available will vary among the European countries in
which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may
need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our
networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy
Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful
interference. As a result, we are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the E.U. Commission to be included in
LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialog with equipment
manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks. We have also requested Member States and the E.U.
Commission to prepare comprehensive national impact assessments when spectrum conditions are changed to ensure that the costs
to prevent interference between the various services are balanced.




                                                               I-44
  United Kingdom

     In the U.K., the Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms
of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006,
which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges,
license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations
2003, as amended, implemented E.U. Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of
privacy in the electronic communications sector.

    Telecommunications companies in the U.K., including Virgin Media, are also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting
Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise
Act 2002. The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) regulates both linear and on-demand programming, which is derived
from the E.U. Audiovisual Media Services Directive.

     Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates in the U.K. It is responsible
for furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant
markets where appropriate by promoting competition. From 2017, Ofcom will also assume the responsibilities of regulating the
BBC, a role currently undertaken by the BBC Trust. The Competition and Markets Authority also has jurisdiction with respect to
competition matters.

    Broadband Expansion. The U.K. government is attempting to drive the provision of super-fast broadband to at least 95% of
the U.K. population by the end of 2017. To stimulate private investment in this endeavor, the U.K. government is using money
from the publicly funded BBC license fee, under-spend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and other sources of public
investment. The state aid measure permitting this subsidy was renewed (and amended) in 2016 and is expected to result in up to
an additional 1%-2% superfast coverage.

     In the 2016 Autumn Statement, the U.K. government announced proposals for further funding, and other measures, targeted
at supporting market rollout of full fiber and 5G services. Proposed measures include public funding for the creation of a match-
funded “full fiber deployment” fund (indicative £400.0 million), business rate relief for the deployment of new full fiber networks
from 2017 and public funding for a strategic program of full fiber and 5G trials (indicative £740.0 million). Little detail has been
provided to date, but the government issued, on December 29, 2016, a call for input, seeking suggestions on how best to stimulate
full fiber deployments, including, where appropriate, with the use of public funds.

     In November 2015, the U.K. government announced that everyone will, by 2020, have a legal right to request a broadband
connection of at least 10 Mbps regardless of where they live. The government intends to achieve this by introducing a broadband
Universal Service Obligation (USO). The USO is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population in the U.K.
without access to a broadband connection of a reasonable speed. The Department for Culture, Media & Sport commissioned Ofcom
to undertake a detailed analysis of the key factors that will help inform the design of the USO. A report was issued to the U.K.
government to this end on December 16, 2016. The U.K. government is considering the Ofcom report and is expected to set out
its decision on the final USO structure and adopt legislation to implement the necessary legislation, in 2017.

     Television and VoD Services. In the U.K., Virgin Media is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts
1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels and any electronic programme guides), which Virgin Media
owns or operates and for the provision of certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides.
These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each
covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions issued by
Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the license holder and, ultimately,
the license being revoked.

     As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), Virgin Media must comply with a number of statutory obligations
in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with
the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the prohibition on providing an ODPS.

     Following a review by Ofcom, Sky’s wholesale must offer obligation, which regulates terms of the wholesale supply of Sky
Sports 1 and 2 in standard definition and HD, was removed. The removal of this obligation was appealed by BT and on December
21, 2016, the Competition Appeal Tribunal issued a judgment denying BT’s appeal.

     Strategic Review of Digital Communications. In March 2015, Ofcom launched a strategic review of U.K. digital
communications. A discussion document was published in July 2015, inviting stakeholder comment and input. Key focus areas
for Ofcom were stated to be: investment and innovation, delivering widespread availability of services; sustainable competition;

                                                                I-45
empowering consumers; and, targeted regulation where necessary, deregulation elsewhere. Virgin Media responded to the
discussion document emphasizing the importance of investment for competition, innovation and consumer interest. A key area of
consideration is the future regulatory treatment of BT, in particular whether BT should be fully (structurally) separated, with the
Openreach network division becoming a separate, independent company. Openreach is the operator of the backbone of Britain’s
broadband internet network.

     An “emerging thinking” document was published on February 25, 2016, setting out conclusions and Ofcom’s proposed policy
position relating to a number of aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime. Key conclusions included: no structural separation of BT
at the present time; an intention to improve quality of service across all providers; a requirement for BT to enhance its wholesale
duct and pole access product; and an intention to advance further consumer protection measures. Later on July 26, 2016, Ofcom
proposed a legal but not structural separation of Openreach. On November 29, 2016, Ofcom stated that it is proceeding with a
formal notification to the E.U. Commission to require the legal separation of Openreach from BT. We expect this notification,
preceded by a consultation, to be made in early 2017, unless Ofcom and BT otherwise reach agreement.

     Regulation of Broadband Markets. In 2017, Ofcom will commence its next triennial review of the Fixed Access markets,
including the Wholesale Local Access market (incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and
duct access) and the Wholesale Broadband Access market (virtual or active network access via methods such as provision of
wholesale managed service products). A key area of focus will be the regulation of BT’s FTTx based wholesale products (specifically
the pricing thereof) and improving the existing physical infrastructure access (allowing third parties access to BT’s duct and pole
estate). To this end, on December 6, 2016, Ofcom issued a consultation on making the physical infrastructure access more effective.

     Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom concluded its latest review of the U.K. business connectivity markets
(leased lines and dedicated business connections, among others) in the spring of 2016. Ofcom found BT held Significant Market
Power in certain markets and proposed consequential regulatory remedies. These remedies included an obligation on BT to provide
access to its dark fiber. BT, CityFibre and TalkTalk have appealed Ofcom’s decision. Virgin Media has intervened in the appeal.
This matter remains ongoing and a hearing is expected in 2017.

    Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to E.U. regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These
regulations: set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming
within the E.U.; provide for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information; impose measures to guard against bill
shock in respect of data roaming; and set maximum roaming rates within the E.U. A new regulation, effective June 2017, abolishes
roaming tariffs in the E.U. (subject to addressing inconsistencies in underlying wholesale charges). Until then, roaming surcharges
have been reduced significantly since April 2016.

     Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power
charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to
Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2015-2018, with rates reducing to approximately half
of their starting levels by the end of this period. As a result, Virgin Media has experienced a reduction in revenue from such charges,
although with some off-setting reductions in cost.

    Fixed voice termination. Virgin Media has been designated as a provider with Significant Market Power on fixed voice
termination. As a result, the rates that it charges other providers for termination on its network are subject to regulation. This
requires, amongst other things, the provision of termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges - which must be
no higher than BT’s regulated charges, unless certain conditions are met.

  Germany

     Germany has incorporated the E.U. laws into national laws, although under the German legal system competency is split
between the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German
Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by
telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The 2009 revisions to the Regulatory
Framework by the E.U. were implemented by Germany in May 2012. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur)
is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel Office (the FCO), the
national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure and media regulation.
The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition issues will be addressed
by the German Federal Network Agency.

    Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16
federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting
Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own

                                                                 I-46
independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector.
The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation
of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of channel
carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, the bundling of programs and price regulation.

     The allocation and use of analog cable transmission capacities for both radio and television channels in Germany is governed
by the must carry rules of the respective German federal states. The allocation of digital transmission capacities for digital television
and radio channels is primarily governed by the must carry rules of the State Broadcasting Treaty. The media law in the states of
Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse where Unitymedia operates, require Unitymedia to carry at least 13, 23
and 24 analog channels, respectively, and also limits Unitymedia’s ability to convert these analog cable channels into digital
channels.

    The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the
German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other
content providers through conditional access systems.

     Unitymedia has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual
fixed public telephone network. Since November 2013, reciprocal termination rates for exchanging calls via Unitymedia’s IP-
interface have been imposed, which results in Unitymedia, like every other telecommunications provider in Germany, charging
the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom. The wholesale tariffs for call termination
on the fixed public telephone networks is set at 0.0024 euro/minute, which rate expired on December 31, 2016. On December 7,
2016, the German Federal Network Agency published a draft decision regarding the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the
public telephone network provided at a fixed location reducing such termination rates for Deutsche Telekom to 0.001 euro/minute
effective January 1, 2017. Although Unitymedia is not regulated for interconnection via the SS7 interface, we expect the new level
of termination rates will be applicable to Unitymedia in 2017 with respect to calls terminating on its NGN interface.

  The Netherlands

     The Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. Pursuant to the electronic
communications law, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, performed a market analysis to determine
which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed its analysis of the
television market and concluded that there were no grounds for regulation of that market. As a result, no new regulations relating
to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis.

     On August 5, 2013, ACM published its latest market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed
termination market and the mobile termination market. The new tariffs became effective September 1, 2013. The decision was
appealed by various operators, including Ziggo, and on August 27, 2013, the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court decided in a
preliminary decision that the decrease of cap charges should be less steep than ACM had initially determined. These revised tariffs
apply until the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court arrives at a final decision in the appeal proceedings on the merits. The Dutch
Supreme Administrative Court ruled on October 15, 2014 to pose prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice. After an
Advocate General opinion, the European Court of Justice ruled on September 15, 2016 that deviation from the European
Commission’s 2009 Recommendation on Termination Rates is only possible if justified by national circumstances. The hearing
at the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court was held on January 11, 2017, and we expect the ruling in the next few months.

     On January 1, 2014, the revised must carry obligations became effective. The revised must carry obligations do not only apply
to cable operators, as was previously the case, but also apply to all providers of analog and digital program packages based on the
principle of technology neutrality. Providers of digital program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers are subject to the
obligation to provide at least 30 television channels, including six public television broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation,
a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and a number of digital radio broadcasting channels. In
addition, all providers of analog program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers must include at least 15 television channels,
including five public broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting
channels and some analog radio broadcasting channels. The Dutch Media Authority can grant a (conditional) exemption from the
obligation if the must carry obligations listed above give rise to disproportionate costs for the network operator, an impediment
to innovation or other unreasonable outcomes.

    There is no regulated financing mechanism in place between network operators and broadcasters. Commercial and public
program providers must negotiate with network operators regarding transmission fees.

    In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator filed an appeal against the E.U. Commission regarding its
decision to approve the acquisition of Ziggo, which we completed in November 2014. We are not a party to the appeal and we do
                                                            I-47
not expect that the filing of this appeal to have any impact on the development of our operations in the Netherlands, including our
contribution of Ziggo Group Holding and its subsidiaries to VodafoneZiggo.

     Following the E.U. Commission’s clearance of our acquisition of Ziggo, on October 31, 2014, ACM published as part of the
fourth round of market analysis a draft of market analysis decision on LLU. Initially, ACM found a risk of joint dominance by
KPN and Ziggo in the related retail broadband market. Later, after notification to the E.U. Commission and further consultations,
ACM published its final decision on December 17, 2015. In the final decision, ACM no longer found a risk of joint dominance
for KPN and Ziggo at the retail level but still concluded that there is a risk of consumer harm due to prices being set above the
competitive equilibrium. At the wholesale level, ACM concluded that KPN is dominant on the wholesale market and imposed
obligations on KPN. ACM concluded that Ziggo is not part of the relevant LLU market and that KPN is dominant on that market.
As a result, ACM imposed obligations on KPN only. ACM has indicated that as a result of the formation of VodafoneZiggo, it will
start working on a new analysis of the LLU market in 2017.

  Belgium

    Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of
June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform a market
analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament
prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012.

     Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed
public telephone network. Since April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging
the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. On August 30, 2016, the BIPT published its
final decision regarding the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the public telephone network provided at a fixed location. As
of November 1, 2016, the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the fixed public telephone networks is set at 0,092 eurocent/
minute. This decision has been appealed before the Court of Appeal in Brussels by Proximus and 3StarsNet and a judgment is
expected during the first half of 2017.

     Although no determination has been made on whether Telenet as an MVNO has Significant Market Power on the market for
call termination on individual mobile networks, its rates have been affected by rate limitations implemented by BIPT. In June
2010, BIPT imposed a steep rate reduction that resulted in (1) an initial 45% decline effective August 1, 2010, over the then average
rate and (2) a further decline in January 2013 that was approximately 79% less than the average rate implemented on August 1,
2010. As of January 1, 2013, mobile termination rates have been set by BIPT at €1.08 cents per minute, and to date, 2015 rates
have not been set. On September 14, 2015, BIPT published its draft decision on the relevant market for “call termination on
individual mobile networks”. Telenet, as an MVNO, has been designated in the draft decision as having Significant Market Power.
Following its acquisition of BASE, Telenet will be designated as having a Significant Market Power by BIPT. In the draft decision,
BIPT adopts a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on individual mobile networks,
resulting in a nominal value of €0.81 per minute in 2015 and a declining glide path up and until 2020. BIPT organized public
consultation on this draft decision, which was open until November 14, 2015. This draft decision has not yet been submitted to
the E.U. Commission for notification. A final decision is expected during the first half of 2017.

    In December 2010, BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities)
published their respective draft decisions reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium. The
Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the July 2011 Decision) with some minor revisions. The
regulatory obligations imposed by the July 2011 Decision include (1) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of the
cable analog package available to third-party operators (including Proximus), (2) an obligation to grant third-party operators (except
Proximus) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at “retail minus”, and (3) an obligation
to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital television access
obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except Proximus).

     In February 2012, Telenet submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above, and the Belgium
Regulatory Authorities published the final decision on September 9, 2013. Telenet has implemented the access obligations as
described in its reference offers and, as of March 1, 2016, Orange Belgium NV (Orange Belgium), formerly known as Mobistar
SA, launched a commercial offer combining a cable TV package and broadband internet access for certain of their mobile customers.
In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014,
Proximus submitted a request to Telenet to commence access negotiations. Telenet contests this request and has asked the Belgium
Regulatory Authorities to assess the reasonableness of the Proximus request. The timing for a decision regarding this assessment
by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities is not known.


                                                                I-48
     On December 14, 2015, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft decision, which amended previously-issued
decisions, and sets forth the “retail minus” tariffs of minus 26% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and
minus 18% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services during an initial two-year period. Following this
two-year period, the tariffs would change to minus 15% and 7%, respectively. The draft decision was notified to the E.U. Commission
and a final decision was adopted on February 19, 2016. A “retail minus” method of pricing involves a wholesale tariff calculated
as the retail price for the offered service by Telenet, excluding value added tax (VAT) and copyrights, and further deducting the
retail costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing and sales).

      Telenet filed an appeal against the July 2011 Decision with the Brussels Court of Appeal. On November 12, 2014, the Brussels
Court of Appeal rejected Telenet’s appeal and accepted Proximus’s claim that Proximus should be allowed access to Telenet’s,
among other operators, digital television platform and the resale of bundles of digital video and broadband internet services. On
November 30, 2015, Telenet filed an appeal of this decision with the Belgian Supreme Court. In 2014, Telenet and wireless operator
Orange Belgium each filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the initial retail minus decision. These appeals are
still pending. On April 25, 2016, Telenet also filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeals challenging the February 19, 2016
retail minus decision. There can be no certainty that Telenet’s appeals will be successful.

     The July 2011 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access
to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in
developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to
Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s
ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on
the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to Telenet’s network and other competitive
factors or market developments.

  Switzerland

     Switzerland has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U., but otherwise is distinct from the European
regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission
of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television,
however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen). In addition, the Competition
Act, the Date Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are potentially relevant to our
business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the revised Energy Ordinance are
applicable to set-top boxes as described below.

    Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunication services needs to register with the Federal Office of
Communications. Dominant providers have to grant access to third parties, including LLU access; however, it is restricted to the
copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to our business in
Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity
being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. Dominant
operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming part of the universal service in Switzerland
have to ensure interoperability of services.

     In regards to call termination as part of interconnection agreements, Swisscom as market dominant provider, must offer these
services at cost-oriented prices and disclose the conditions and prices for their individual access services. In interconnection
agreements with Swisscom, reciprocal termination rates are imposed. The Federal Council has suggested that the current
Telecommunications Act be revised. The Federal Council plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s
network, better consumer protection (decreasing roaming fees, unbundling of products, measures to prevent spoofing) and a change
to the regulatory regime giving the Federal Communications Commission partial ex officio rights to impose obligations on market
dominant providers. Further, the Federal Council will implement consumer and youth protection measures. The topic of regulated
net neutrality may be introduced in the revision. In addition, it is expected that the conditions for a national broadband rollout will
be improved by introducing access obligations to the ducts of local utilities. The proposal is expected by September 2017, but
would not be legally binding prior to 2020.

    Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain
programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of
Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation.
Since January 1, 2015, those programs must no longer be broadcasted in analog.



                                                                 I-49
    Effective August 1, 2016, the Federal Council adapted its regulation on imposing power thresholds for set-top boxes to E.U.-
levels. As a result, Switzerland will have the same power thresholds as member countries of the E.U.

     In regards to lawful interception, the Federal Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications was finished in Swiss
Parliament’s Spring Session 2016. Changes in the respective ordinance will be discussed in Parliament in Spring 2017. Relevant
issues for us are automated information disclosure and identification of all clients by ID as this would mean mandatory changes
of our ordering processes.

    In September 2016, the Intelligence Agencies Act was approved by the Swiss population. For Telecommunications service
providers, the Intelligence Agencies Act contemplates new obligations regulating cable traffic. The respective ordinance containing
details of the implementation will be under consultation during the first quarter of 2017.

    A revised version of the Data Protection Act is currently under public consultation until April 2017. The revised version
foresees more transparency regarding the processing of data, for example by reinforcing the information duties when processing
personal data. Furthermore, the new version follows the developments in the E.U.

  LiLAC Group

  CWC

     The video, broadband and telephony services provided by CWC are subject to regulation and enforcement by various
governmental entities in each of the jurisdictions such services are provided. The scope and reach of these regulations are distinct
in each market. Generally, CWC provides services in accordance with licenses and concessions granted by national authorities
pursuant to national telecommunication legislation and associated regulations. Certain of these regulatory requirements are
summarized below.

    As the incumbent telecommunications provider in many of its jurisdictions, CWC is subject to significant regulatory oversight
with respect to the provision of fixed-line and mobile telephony services. Generally, in these markets, CWC operates under a
government issued license or concession that enables it to own and operate its telecommunication networks, including the
establishment of wireless networks and the use of spectrum. These licenses and concessions are typically non-exclusive and have
renewable multi-year terms that include competitive, qualitative and rate regulation. Licenses and concessions are scheduled to
expire over the next two years in Jamaica, Cayman Islands and Barbados.

    Rate regulation of CWC’s telephony services typically includes price caps that set the maximum rates CWC may charge to
customers, or legislation that requires consent from a regulator prior to any price increases. In addition, all regulators determine
and set the rates that may be charged by all telephony operators, including CWC, for interconnect charges, access charges between
operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other
providers, and charges for network unbundling services. In addition, in certain markets, regulators set, or are seeking to set,
mobile roaming rates.

     In recent years, a number of markets in which CWC operates have demonstrated an increased interest in regulating various
aspects of broadband internet services due to the increasing importance and availability of high speed broadband. As broadband
internet access has become a national priority for many of CWC’s markets, national regulators have demonstrated an increased
focus on the issues of network resilience, broadband affordability and penetration, quality of services and consumer rights. Certain
regulators are also seeking to mandate third-party access to CWC’s network infrastructure, including dark fibre and landing
stations, as well as to regulate wholesale services and prices.

     As an example, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL), the regulatory body for telecommunications
in five Eastern Caribbean States (Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines), has adopted an Electronic Communications Bill that may have a material adverse impact on CWC’s operations in
the ECTEL member states. The proposed Electronic Communications Bill includes provisions relating to:

                  •       net neutrality principles mandating equal access to all content and applications regardless of the source
                          and without favoring, degrading, interrupting, intercepting, blocking access or throttling speeds;
                  •       subscription television rate regulation;
                  •       regulations implementing market dominance rules;
                  •       network unbundling at regulated rates; and

                                                                I-50
                  •       mandated unbundled access to all landing station network elements at cost-based rates.

    We currently cannot determine the impact these provisions will have on our operations because national regulators are
required to conduct extensive market reviews before adopting specific measures. Moreover, while we expect the legislation will
be enacted during 2017, the bill will not become law in any individual ECTEL state until implementing legislation has been
adopted by that state. As such, the timing and ultimate effect of the bill is unclear.

    In Panama, as a result of a public consultation process, we expect the regulator to issue new guidelines for the Internet Public
Service, establishing new quality goals for this service.

     In addition to rate regulation, several markets in which CWC operates have imposed, or are considering imposing, regulation
designed to further encourage competition, including introducing requirements related to unbundling, network access to third
parties, and local number portability (LNP). LNP has been implemented in Panama, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica and is
currently being contemplated or implemented in other jurisdictions, including Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago.

    The pay television service provided in certain CWC markets is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations
and must-carry and retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations.

     CWC is subject to universal service obligations in a number of markets. These obligations vary in specificity and extent, but
they are generally related to ensuring widespread geographic coverage of networks and that the populations of CWC’s individual
markets have access to basic telecommunication services at minimum quality standards. In a number of cases, CWC is required
to support universal access/service goals through contributions to universal service funds or participate in universal service related
projects.

    In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, CWC’s operating companies must comply with both specific
and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention, consumer protection and electronic commerce. These
operating companies are also subject to national level regulations on competition and on consumer protection.

    The CWC Acquisition triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which CWC operates. The
regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Seychelles and
the Cayman Islands, have not completed their review of the CWC Acquisition or granted their approval. While we expect to
receive all outstanding approvals, such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse
impact on CWC’s operations and financial condition.

     In Trinidad and Tobago, CWC was required by Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT), in connection
with TATT’s approval of CWC’s acquisition of Columbus International, to dispose of its 49% shareholding in the
Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT). The disposal of CWC’s stake in TSTT is not complete
and the deadline set by TATT for such completion has been extended until the end of March 2017. We may not be able to complete
the sale of TSTT or realize the full value of TSTT from our divestiture due to the circumstances of the sale. The stake in TSTT
is currently held for sale.

  Chile

    VTR is subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental entities in Chile including the Chilean Antitrust
Authority, the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (the Ministry) through the Chilean Undersecretary of
Telecommunications (SubTel), the National Television Council (CNTV) and the National Consumer Service (Sernac).

     In addition to the specific regulations described below, VTR is subject to certain regulatory conditions which were imposed
by the Chilean Antitrust Authority in connection with VTR’s combination with Metrópolis Intercom SA in April 2005. These
conditions are indefinite and include, among others, (1) prohibiting VTR and its control group from participating, directly or
indirectly through a related person, in Chilean satellite or microwave television businesses, (2) prohibiting VTR from obtaining
exclusive broadcast rights, except for specific events, and (3) requiring VTR to offer its broadband capacity for resale of internet
services on a wholesale basis.

    Video. The provision of pay television services requires a permit issued by the Ministry. Cable pay television permits are
granted for an indefinite term and are non-exclusive. As such permits do not involve radio electric spectrum, they are granted
without ongoing duties or royalties. VTR has permits to provide cable pay television services in the major cities, including Santiago,
and in most of the medium-sized markets in Chile.


                                                                 I-51
     Cable television service providers in Chile are free to define the channels and content included in their services and are not
required to carry any specific programming, except as described below. However, CNTV may impose sanctions on providers who
are found to have run programming containing excessive violence, pornography or other objectionable content. Pay television
operators are directly responsible for violation of such prohibitions. Additionally, the Television Act requires pay television operators
to offer a certain quota of cultural content and to distribute public interest campaigns.

     The Television Act establishes a retransmission consent regime between broadcast television concessionaires and pay television
operators. This regime provides that once a broadcast operator achieves digital coverage of 85% of the population within its
concession areas, the broadcast operator may require that pay television operators enter into an agreement for the retransmission
of its digital signal. In addition, the Television Act requires that the technical or commercial conditions imposed by broadcast
operators not discriminate among pay television operators. Also, the Television Act establishes a must carry regime requiring pay
television operators to distribute up to four local broadcast television channels in each operating area. The channels that must be
carried by any particular pay television operator are to be selected by CNTV. The full implementation of the retransmission and
must carry regimes are still pending.

     VTR’s ability to change its channel lineup is restricted by an agreement reached with Sernac in July 2012 and the general
regulation established by SubTel in February 2014 (by the Telecommunication Services General Rulemaking). This framework
allows VTR to change one or more channels from its lineup after a 60-day notice period to its subscribers. In such cases, VTR
shall offer a channel of similar content and quality or a proportional compensation. Despite this, after certain channel adjustments
were applied in July 2016, the excluded programmers as well as social media have questioned VTR’s ability to unilaterally modify
its channel grid, arguing that content and quality of new channels should be identical to the excluded channels. A final position
on this issue is pending.

     Internet. A law on internet neutrality prohibits “arbitrary blockings” of legal content, applications or services and the provision
of differentiated service conditions according to the origin or ownership of the content or service provided through the internet.
Additionally, the law authorizes ISPs to take measures to ensure the privacy of their users and provide virus protection and safety
processes over their network, as long as these measures do not infringe antitrust laws. Additional measures have been implemented,
including obligations related to consumer information, traffic management policies, internet quality of service requirements and
notices required by law concerning the effective maximum and minimum traffic speeds offered under internet access plans.

     In order to protect the constitutional rights of privacy and safety of communications, ISPs are prohibited from undertaking
surveillance measures over data content on their networks. Also, special summary proceedings have been created in order to
safeguard intellectual property rights against violations committed through networks or digital systems. These proceedings include
measures designed to withdraw, disqualify or block infringing content in the ISP’s network or systems. The law also provides for
the right of intellectual property owners to judicially request from ISPs the delivery of necessary information to identify the provider
of infringing content.

     A bill is being discussed in the Congress, which would, if enacted, impose on fixed and mobile ISPs an obligation to guarantee
a minimum broadband throughput based on the offered speed. The proposed bill would also require ISPs to provide its subscribers
a certified measurement tool allowing them to verify this minimum service level and subject the ISPs to fines of penalties if the
service level is not fulfilled. We expect this bill will be passed during the second quarter of 2017.

     Fixed-Line Telephony and Mobile Services. The provision of fixed-line telephony and mobile services requires a public
telecommunications service concession. With respect to mobile services, in 2009, SubTel awarded VTR a license for 30 MHz of
spectrum in the 1700/2100 MHz frequency band for the provision of wireless telephony services. The license has a 30-year
renewable term. In 2012, VTR transferred this license to its affiliate VTR Wireless SpA (VTR Wireless), which is now a subsidiary
of VTR known as VTR Comunicaciones SpA. On January 15, 2014, SubTel initiated a proceeding against VTR Wireless based
on having allegedly “altered an essential element of its concession, particularly the type of service”. In this proceeding, SubTel
asserted that VTR Wireless is not in compliance with the terms of such wireless license. SubTel alleged that the terms of the
wireless license require VTR Wireless to comply with certain minimum network coverage and traffic levels. VTR disagreed with
SubTel’s assertions regarding the terms of the wireless license and contested such assertions vigorously. The maximum possible
sanctions include “the termination of the concession”. The final ruling regarding this case is still pending.

    VTR has concessions to provide fixed-line telephony in most major and medium-sized markets in Chile. Telephony concessions
are non-exclusive and have renewable 30-year terms. The original term of VTR’s fixed-line telephony concessions expires in
November 2025. Long distance telephony services are considered intermediate telecommunications services and, as such, are also
regulated by the Ministry. VTR has concessions to provide this service, which is non-exclusive, for a 30-year renewable term
expiring in September 2025.



                                                                  I-52
    There are no universal service obligations in Chile. However, local service concessionaires are obligated to provide telephony
service to all customers that are within their service area or are willing to pay for an extension to receive service. All local service
providers, including VTR, must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network connections at
regulated prices and must interconnect with all other public service concessionaires whose systems are technically compatible.

     As a general rule, fixed-line telephony service providers are free to establish the rates directly charged to their customers,
unless the Chilean Antitrust Authority concludes that due to a lack of sufficient competition in the market, rates should be fixed
by SubTel. However, SubTel sets the maximum rates that may be charged by each operator for interconnect charges, access charges
between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other
providers, and charges for network unbundling services. Rate regulation on interconnection charges is applicable to all fixed-line
and mobile telephony companies, including VTR. The determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by operators for
their fixed-line or mobile services are made on a case-by-case basis by SubTel and are effective for five years. The next VTR tariff
setting is in process, which will define some of VTR’s tariffs from June 2017 to June 2022.

    Other Chilean Regulation

      •   Price Increase. The Consumer Rights Protection Law contains provisions that require that any raise in rates exceeding
          inflation must be previously accepted and agreed to by subscribers. Although VTR disagrees with this interpretation, in
          July 2012, VTR reached an agreement with Sernac that permits VTR to make adjustments to its published prices twice
          per year to adjust for inflation, except those services that are subject to rate regulation. VTR is generally prohibited from
          increasing the rates over the inflation adjustment. VTR may, however, cancel a subscriber’s contract after 12 months and
          propose a new contract with new rate provisions. Once a year VTR may propose to its existing subscribers additional
          changes to their rates, which must be accepted by the subscriber for the rates to go into effect.

•         Bundling. On December 18, 2012, the Chilean Antitrust Authority issued its regulation governing the on-net/off-net
          pricing practice in the mobile industry and the offering of bundled telecommunication services. Pursuant to the terms of
          this regulation, as revised by the Chilean Supreme Court, mobile services may be sold jointly with fixed-line services.
          However, promotional discounts were not permitted for these double-play offers. As for traditional bundling over the
          same platform (e.g., bundled fixed-line services such as our double- and triple-play packages, or bundled mobile services),
          this regulation provides that such services may be bundled, subject to certain price limitations. These limitations require
          that the total price for a bundle must be greater than the standalone price for the most expensive service included in the
          bundle. Also, when three or more services are bundled, the price for the bundle must be greater than the sum of the
          standalone prices for each service in the bundle, excluding the lowest priced service.

      •   Telecommunication Services Proposal. In February 2014, SubTel published a General Telecommunication Services Ruling
          that regulates the offer of telecommunication services, including voice, internet access, and pay television, either alone
          or in bundles, from a consumer protection point of view. The regulation introduced service billing, significant changes
          in contracts with customers, requirements regarding compensation in case of service failure, and rules regarding treatment
          of customers’ personal information.

      •   Minimum Standards on Quality of Service and Operation. From August 5 to September 4, 2013, SubTel submitted for
          public comment a draft of the Technical Fundamental Plan on Maintenance and Public Service Telecommunications
          Network Managing. This draft seeks to impose minimum standards on quality of service and operation of
          telecommunications networks, in general, and in some particular services: voice services; text and multimedia messages
          services; data transmission services; minimum coverage for mobile services; and digital terrestrial television minimum
          coverage. We are uncertain when SubTel will publish the final version of the plan.

      •   Consumer’s Rights Protection Law Amendment. A bill is being discussed at Congress assigning significant new powers
          to Sernac, including a material increase of fines and compensations. The current law acknowledges that legal regulations
          imposed on specific business activities (such as the Telecommunications Act) must prevail over the Consumer’s Rights
          Protection law. However, it is still uncertain how or whether Sernac and SubTel will redefine their respective scope.

    Puerto Rico

     We are subject to regulation in Puerto Rico by various governmental entities at the Puerto Rico and the U.S. federal level,
including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board (TRB),
which was established in 1996, has primary regulatory jurisdiction in Puerto Rico at the local level and is responsible for awarding
franchises to cable operators for the provision of cable service in Puerto Rico and regulating cable television and telecommunications
services.


                                                                 I-53
    Our business in Puerto Rico is subject to comprehensive regulation under the United States Communications Act of 1934, as
amended (the Communications Act), which regulates communication, telecommunication and cable television services. The
Communications Act also provides the general legal framework for, among other things, the provision of telephone services,
services related to interconnection between telephone carriers, and television, radio, cable television and direct broadcast satellite
services.

     The FCC and/or the TRB have the authority to impose sanctions, including warnings, fines, license revocations and, in certain
specific cases, termination of the franchise, although license revocation and franchise termination are rare. The Communications
Act specifies causes for the termination of FCC licenses, including, for example, the failure to comply with license requirements
and conditions or to pay fines or fees in a timely manner. Such sanctions by the TRB and/or FCC can be appealed to, and reviewed
by, Puerto Rican courts and U.S. federal courts.

     In Puerto Rico, antitrust regulation is governed by the U.S. Sherman Act, other federal antitrust legislation, and the Puerto
Rico Anti-Monopoly Law. In particular, the Sherman Act seeks to prevent anti-competitive practices in the marketplace and requires
governmental review of certain business combinations, among other things. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements
included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Law substantially parallels the Sherman
Act and authorizes the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to investigate and impose competition-related conditions on transactions.

     Puerto Rico Law 5 of 1973, as amended, created the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates marketing
campaigns, publicity, and breach of service contracts, and prohibits false advertising. The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act
of 1996 (Law 213), which created the TRB, requires that rates for telecommunication services be cost-based, forbids cross-subsidies
and focuses on encouraging, preserving and enforcing competition in the cable and telecommunications markets. Although Law
213 does not require us to obtain any approval of rate increases for cable television or telecommunication services, any such
increases must be in compliance with Law 213’s requirements, including prior notification to the TRB before such increases take
effect.

    The video, internet and fixed-line telephony services that we provide are all subject to regulation:

    •    Video. The provision of cable television services requires a franchise issued by the TRB. Franchises are subject to
         termination proceedings in the event of a material breach or failure to comply with certain material provisions set forth
         in the franchise agreement governing a franchisee’s system operations, although such terminations are rare. In addition,
         franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the grant of authority. Franchises establish comprehensive
         facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-
         compliance. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of up to ten years and must be periodically renewed.

         Our pay television service is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations and must-carry and
         retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations. The Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the carriage
         relationship between broadcast television stations and cable companies. To ensure that every qualifying local television
         station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals,
         the FCC allows every qualifying full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems transmit
         that station’s primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station’s market (the “must-carry” rule) pursuant to
         the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Alternatively, a station may elect every three years
         to forego its must carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local cable system,
         referred to as retransmission consent.

    •    Internet. We offer high-speed internet access throughout our entire footprint. In March 2015, the FCC issued an order
         classifying mass-market broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service”, changing its long-standing
         treatment of this offering as an “information service”, which the FCC traditionally has subjected to limited regulation.
         The rules adopted by the FCC prohibit, among other things, broadband providers from: (1) blocking access to lawful
         content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of
         content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (3) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful
         internet traffic in exchange for consideration. In addition, the FCC prohibited broadband providers from unreasonably
         interfering with users’ ability to access lawful content or use devices that do not harm the network, or with edge providers’
         ability to disseminate their content. The FCC also imposed more detailed disclosure obligations on broadband providers
         than were previously in place, which were approved by the Office of Management and Budget in late 2015. The FCC’s
         rules are in effect, and were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The impact
         of these revised rules on our business is unclear.

    •    Fixed-Line Telephony Services. We offer fixed-line telephony services, including both circuit-switched telephony and
         VoIP. Our circuit-switched telephony services are subject to FCC and local regulations regarding the quality and technical
                                                                 I-54
         aspects of service. All local telecommunications providers, including us, are obligated to provide telephony service to all
         customers within the service area, subject to certain exceptions under FCC regulations, and must give long distance
         telephony service providers equal access to their network. Under the Communications Act, competitive local exchange
         carriers (CLECs), like us, may require interconnection with the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), and the ILEC
         must negotiate a reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection agreement with the CLEC. Such arrangement requires
         the ILEC to interconnect with the CLEC at any technically feasible point within the ILEC’s network, provide access to
         unbundled network elements of the ILEC’s network, offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunication services
         the ILEC provides to its own retail clients, and allow physical collocation of the CLEC’s equipment in the ILEC’s facilities
         to permit interconnection or access to unbundled network element services. Therefore, we have the right to interconnect
         with the incumbent local exchange carrier (PRT). We have negotiated an interconnection agreement with PRT, and the
         physical interconnection between both companies has been activated.

         All of our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for the Federal Universal Service Fund
         (USF), which is a fund created under the Communications Act to subsidize telecommunication services in high-cost
         areas, to provide telecommunications services for low-income consumers, and to provide certain subsidies for schools,
         libraries and rural healthcare facilities. The FCC has redirected the focus of USF to support broadband deployment in
         high-cost areas. In addition, our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for a local Puerto
         Rico Universal Service Fund, which was created by law to subsidize telecommunications services for low-income families
         under the Federal USF Lifeline and Link-Up programs.

         The FCC has adopted other regulations for VoIP services, including the requirement that interconnected VoIP providers
         and facilities-based broadband internet access providers must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law
         Enforcement Act, which requires carriers to provide certain assistance to federal law enforcement authorities. VoIP
         providers are also required to offer basic and enhanced 911 emergency calling services, which requires disclosure to all
         VoIP customers. VoIP providers are also subject to federal customer proprietary network information rules related to
         customer privacy.

Employees

    As of December 31, 2016, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 41,000 full-time
equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works councils, and includes contractors and temporary
employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

     Financial information related to the geographic areas in which we do business appears in note18 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Available Information

    All our filings with the SEC as well as amendments to such filings are available on our internet website free of charge generally
within 24 hours after we file such material with the SEC. Our website address is www.libertyglobal.com. The information on our
website is not part of this Annual Report and is not incorporated by reference herein.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating
our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our company.

    The risk factors described in this section have been separated into five groups:

    •    risks that relate to the competition we face and the technology used in our businesses;

    •    risks that relate to our operating in overseas markets and being subject to foreign regulation;

    •    risks that relate to certain financial matters;

    •    risks relating to our equity capital structure; and

    •    other risks, including risks that, among other things, relate to the obstacles that may be faced by anyone who may seek
         to acquire us.

                                                                 I-55
     Although we describe below and elsewhere in this Annual Report the risks we consider to be the most material, there may be
other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse
effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, past financial performance
may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.

    If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Factors Relating to Competition and Technology

     We operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively compete with other
service providers. The markets for cable television, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services are highly competitive. In
the provision of video services, we face competition from FTA and DTT broadcasters, video provided via satellite platforms,
networks using DSL, VDSL or vectoring technology, MMDS operators, FTTx networks, OTT video content aggregators, and, in
some countries where parts of our systems are overbuilt, cable networks, among others. Our operating businesses are facing
increasing competition from video services provided by, or over the networks of, incumbent telecommunications operators and
other service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet increases, we also face competition from OTT video
content providers utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections. In the provision of telephony and broadband
internet services, we are experiencing increasing competition from the incumbent telecommunications operators and other service
providers in each country in which we operate, as well as mobile providers of voice and data. The incumbent telecommunications
operators typically dominate the market for these services and have the advantage of nationwide networks and greater resources
than we have to devote to the provision of these services. Many of the incumbent operators offer double-play, triple-play and
quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries, we also compete with other operators using LLU to provide these services,
other facilities-based operators and wireless providers. Developments in the DSL and other technology used by the incumbent
telecommunications operators and alternative providers have improved the attractiveness of our competitors’ products and services
and strengthened their competitive position. Developments in wireless technologies, such as LTE (the next generation of ultra
high-speed mobile data) and WiFi, are creating additional competitive challenges.

     In some of our markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved, either directly or indirectly,
in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications systems. We intend to pursue available options to
restrict such involvement or to ensure that such involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in these pursuits. As a result, we may face competition from entities not requiring a normal
commercial return on their investments. In addition, we may face more vigorous competition than would have been the case if
there were no government involvement.

     We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and new market
entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, advances in technology, the
influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased
competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and
significant price and promotional competition in most of our markets. In combination with difficult economic environments, these
competitive pressures could adversely impact our ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, revenue per average
cable RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable (ARPU), RGUs, mobile subscribers, adjusted operating income before depreciation
and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA), Adjusted OIBDA margins and liquidity of our operating segments.

     Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Technology in the video,
telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including advances in current technologies and the emergence
of new technologies. New technologies, products and services may impact consumer behavior and therefore demand for our
products and services. The ability to anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and
enhanced products and services on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our revenue and number of
subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations or demand,
can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance of new products and
services that we may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or services by others, could have a material
adverse impact on our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA.

     Our significant property and equipment additions, namely in connection with our Network Extensions, may not generate
a positive return. The video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile businesses in which we operate are capital intensive.
Significant additions to our property and equipment are required to add customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our
broadband communications networks and upgrade customer premises equipment to enhance our service offerings and improve
the customer experience. Of note, since 2015, we have undertaken our Network Extensions to connect additional homes and
                                                                 I-56
businesses to our networks (see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
- Overview). Additions to our property and equipment, including in connection with our Network Extensions, require significant
capital expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs to build out and/or upgrade our networks as well as for related
customer premises equipment. Additionally, significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing
technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to
undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and customer premises equipment in the impacted markets. No assurance
can be given that any upgrades or extensions of our network (including the Network Extensions) will increase penetration rates,
increase ARPU or otherwise generate positive returns as anticipated, or that we will have adequate capital available to finance
such upgrades or extensions. Additionally, costs related to our property and equipment additions, including with respect to our
Network Extensions, could end up being be greater than originally anticipated or planned. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay
for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding, extending or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or
unplanned additions to our property and equipment, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed.

      We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters for
programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable terms could adversely
affect our business. The success of our video subscription business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a wide selection
of popular programming to our subscribers. We generally do not produce our own content and we depend on our agreements,
relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If we
fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay television services, including a sufficient selection of HD channels
as well as non-linear content (such as a selection of attractive VoD content and rights for ancillary services such as DVR and catch
up or 'Replay' services), on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling video product to our customers at a price
they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and our annual
costs for programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming
agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming and copyright costs will continue to rise in future periods
as a result of (i) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary
product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, (ii) rate increases and (iii) growth in the number
of our enhanced video subscribers.

     If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and future television
services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers
from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore,
we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain of our competitors obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly
with respect to popular sports and movie programming, and as certain entrants in the OTT market, for example Netflix and Amazon,
increasingly produce their own exclusive content.

     We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services required
for our businesses. We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide
services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various
risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor
issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis
or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in completing extensions to our
networks and in connecting customers to our services and, accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase
our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial
difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect
our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party
suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an
adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various
technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our
or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into
licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights
in question.

     Certain of our businesses that offer mobile telephony and data services rely on the radio access networks of third-party
wireless network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. Our services to mobile customers in many jurisdictions
in which we operate rely on the use of MVNO arrangements in which we utilize the radio access networks of third-party wireless
network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. If any of our MVNO arrangements are terminated, or if the respective
third-party wireless network provider fails to provide the services required under an MVNO arrangement, or if a third-party wireless
network provider fails to deploy and maintain its network, and we are unable to find a replacement network operator on a timely
and commercially reasonable basis or at all, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services relying on such MVNO
                                                                 I-57
arrangement. Additionally, as our MVNO arrangements come to term, we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement
MVNO arrangements on the same or more favorable terms.

     Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data could significantly disrupt
our operations, which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue. Our success depends, in part, on the continued
and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and network systems as well as our customer service centers. The
hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed
in a relatively small number of locations. Our systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable to
damage or security breach from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts,
security flaws, and natural disasters. For example, in early October 2016, our fixed-line and mobile networks in the Bahamas
suffered extensive damage as a result of Hurricane Matthew, which caused our customers to experience significant outages (see
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview). Moreover, despite
security measures, our servers, systems and equipment are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer
viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks
caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information
technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result
of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such
information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy
and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a
large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences,
fines.

     Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause failures in our information
technology systems or disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks or similar problems. Any disruptive situation
that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our reputation and the credibility of our operations.
Further, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to our customers or otherwise meet our
business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and an adverse
impact on revenue.

     The “Virgin” brand is used by our subsidiary Virgin Media under licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited and is not
under the control of Virgin Media. The activities of the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand and other licensees
could have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of customers towards Virgin Media as a licensee and the licenses from
Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. The “Virgin” brand is integral to Virgin Media’s corporate
identity. Virgin Media is reliant on the general goodwill of consumers towards the Virgin brand. Consequently, adverse publicity
in relation to the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson, who is closely
associated with the brand, or in relation to another licensee of the “Virgin” name and logo (particularly in the U.K., where Virgin
Media does business) could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s reputation and on Virgin Media’s and our business
and results of operations. In addition, the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances.
For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the licenses, after providing Virgin Media with an opportunity to cure, (1)
if Virgin Media or any of its affiliates commits persistent and material breaches or a flagrant and material breach of the licenses,
(2) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the licensed trademarks by
Virgin Media has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the “Virgin” brand, or (3) if a
third-party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a “fit and proper person”, such as a legally disqualified director or a
bankrupt entity, acquires “control” of Liberty Global. Such a termination could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s
and our business and results of operations.

Factors Relating to Overseas Operations and Foreign Regulation

    Our businesses are conducted almost exclusively outside of the U.S., which gives rise to numerous operational risks. Our
businesses operate almost exclusively in countries outside the U.S. and are thereby subject to the following inherent risks:

    •    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

    •    difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    •    potentially adverse tax consequences;

    •    export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers;

    •    increases in taxes and governmental fees;

                                                                I-58
    •    economic and political instability; and

    •    changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies.

     Operational risks that we may experience in certain countries include disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment
that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political
unrest.

     We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect
to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the
operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although we generally seek to match the
denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the
respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not
denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for
an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert
unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2016, substantially all of our debt was either directly
or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations.

      In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are
exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts,
notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in
our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In this regard, excluding CWC,
we currently expect that during 2017, (1) less than 1% of our revenue, (2) approximately 1% to 3% of our direct costs of services
and our other operating and SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) and (3) approximately 10% to 12%
of our property and equipment additions will be denominated in non-functional currencies, including amounts denominated in
U.S. dollars, euros and British pound sterling. Our expectations with respect to our non-functional currency transactions in 2017
may differ from actual results. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from
agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can
reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In
this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks. Certain non-functional currency
risks related to our revenue, direct costs of services and other operating and SG&A expenses and property and equipment additions
were not hedged as of December 31, 2016. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note
7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against
the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign
currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency
translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a
negative impact on our comprehensive earnings or loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency
translation. Our primary exposure to foreign currency translation risk during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was to
the euro and British pound sterling as 43.2% and 27.5% of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries
whose functional currencies are the euro and British pound sterling, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are
impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Swiss franc, the Chilean peso and other local currencies in Europe. We generally
do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries
and affiliates into U.S. dollars.

     Our businesses are subject to risks of adverse regulation. Our businesses are subject to the unique regulatory regimes of the
countries in which they operate. Notably, with the acquisition of CWC, the number of countries in which we operate, and therefore
the number of regulatory regimes to which we are subject, increased significantly. Video distribution, broadband internet, telephony
and mobile businesses are subject to licensing or registration eligibility rules and regulations, which vary by country. The provision
of electronic communications networks and services requires our licensing from, or registration with, the appropriate regulatory
authorities and, for telephony services, entrance into interconnection arrangements with other phone companies, including the
incumbent phone company. It is possible that countries in which we operate may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic
commerce, which could dampen the growth of the internet services being offered and developed by these businesses. In a number
                                                                  I-59
of countries, our ability to increase the prices we charge for our cable television service or make changes to the programming
packages we offer is limited by regulation or conditions imposed by competition authorities or is subject to review by regulatory
authorities or is subject to termination rights of customers. In addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third
parties and, in any event, in most of our markets new entry is possible without a license, although there may be registration
eligibility rules and regulations, resulting in greater competition in territories where our businesses may already be active. More
significantly, regulatory authorities may require us to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or
services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Consequently, our businesses must adapt their
ownership and organizational structure as well as their pricing and service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which
they are subject. A failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business
or loss of required licenses or other adverse conditions.

    Adverse changes in rules and regulations could:

    •    impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue and Adjusted OIBDA;

    •    create a shortage of capacity on our networks, which could limit the types and variety of services we seek to provide our
         customers;

    •    impact our ability to access spectrum for our mobile services;

    •    strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets; and

    •    have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.

     Businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, such as video distribution as well as internet, telephony, and/or mobile
services, or that are vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, often face close regulatory
scrutiny from competition authorities in several countries in which they operate. This is particularly the case with respect to any
proposed business combinations, which will often require clearance from national competition authorities. The regulatory
authorities in several countries in which we do business have considered from time to time what access rights, if any, should be
afforded to third parties for use of existing cable television networks and have imposed access obligations in certain countries.
This has resulted, for example, in obligations with respect to call termination for our telephony business in Europe, video must
carry obligations in many markets in which we operate and video and broadband internet access obligations in Belgium.

     When we acquire additional communications companies, these acquisitions may require the approval of governmental
authorities (either at country or, in the case of the E.U., European level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an
acquisition, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely
manner, the governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative
measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Most recently, the CWC Acquisition triggered
regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which CWC operates. The regulatory authorities in certain of these
jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Seychelles and the Cayman Islands, have not completed
their review of the CWC Acquisition or granted their approval. While we expect to receive all outstanding approvals, such approvals
may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on CWC’s operations and financial condition.

    Moreover, in several of CWC’s key markets, including Panama and the Bahamas, governments are CWC’s partners and co-
owners. Consequently, we may not be able to fully utilize CWC’s contractual or legal rights or all options available, where to do
so might conflict with broader regulatory or governmental considerations.

     New legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regime applicable to us, which could adversely affect our competitive
position and profitability, and we may become subject to more extensive regulation if we are deemed to possess significant
market power in any of the markets in which we operate. Significant changes to the existing regulatory regime applicable to the
provision of cable television, telephony, internet and mobile services have been and are still being introduced. For example, in the
E.U. a large element of regulation affecting our business derives from a number of Directives that are the basis of the regulatory
regime concerning many of the services we offer across the E.U. The various Directives require Member States to harmonize their
laws on communications and cover issues such as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by
the E.U. from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our businesses are
regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, we are subject to review by competition or national regulatory
authorities in certain countries concerning whether we exhibit Significant Market Power. A finding of Significant Market Power
can result in our company becoming subject to pricing, open access, unbundling and other requirements that could provide a more
favorable operating environment for existing and potential competitors.


                                                                 I-60
     The U.K. referendum advising for the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved,
on an advisory basis, an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The terms of any withdrawal are subject to a
negotiation period that could last at least two years after the British government formally initiates a withdrawal process pursuant
to Article 50 of the Treaty on Europe. The British government has indicated that it plans to trigger Article 50 and commence
negotiations to determine the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U. by the end of March 2017. A withdrawal could, among
other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine
bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations
(including the U.S.) as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. The initial impact of the announcement of Brexit caused
significant volatility in global stock markets, including in the prices of our shares, as well as significant currency fluctuations that
resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against foreign currencies in which we conduct business,
namely the British pound sterling and the euro.

     The potential impacts, if any, of the uncertainty relating to Brexit or the resulting terms of the withdrawal of the U.K. from
the E.U. on customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters
are unclear. Examples of the impact Brexit could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations include:

    •    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the capital markets. For example, a sustained period of
         weakness in the British pound sterling or the euro could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, including our ability to
         fund repurchases of our equity securities and other U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements;

    •    legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws and
         directives to replace or replicate, or where previously implemented by enactment of U.K. laws or regulations, to retain,
         amend or repeal;

    •    uncertainty as to the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the E.U. in terms of the impact
         on the free movement of our services, capital and employees;

    •    global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to reevaluate what they are willing to spend on our products
         and services; and

    •    various geopolitical forces may impact the global economy and our business, including, for example, other E.U. member
         states (in particular those member states where we have operations) proposing referendums to, or electing to, exit the
         E.U.

     We cannot be certain that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or integrating acquired businesses with our
existing operations, or that we will achieve the expected returns on our acquisitions. Historically, our businesses have grown,
in part, through selective acquisitions that enabled them to take advantage of existing networks, local service offerings and region-
specific management expertise. We expect to seek to continue growing our businesses through acquisitions in selected markets,
such as the acquisition of Choice in June 2015, the BASE acquisition in February 2016, the CWC Acquisition in May 2016, and
the pending acquisitions of Multimedia Polska S.A. (Multimedia) and Coditel Brabant sprl, operating under the SFR brand (SFR
BeLux). Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing, debt covenants,
the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential targets, government regulation and competition from other
potential acquirers, including private equity funds. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of these
businesses, such as Choice, BASE, CWC, Multimedia and SFR BeLux may present significant costs and challenges associated
with: realizing economies of scale in interconnection, programming and network operations; eliminating duplicative overheads;
integrating personnel, networks, financial systems and operational systems; greater than anticipated expenditures required for
compliance with regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and failure to achieve the business plan
with respect to any such acquisition. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or realizing the
anticipated benefits of any completed acquisition, including, for example, the acquisitions of Choice, BASE and CWC, and the
pending acquisitions of Multimedia and SFR BeLux.

     In addition, we anticipate that most, if not all, companies acquired by us will be located outside the U.S. Foreign companies
may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as
those required by U.S. securities laws. While we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence and to implement appropriate controls
and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies’
disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting until we have fully integrated them.

     We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such
as value added tax, or VAT, in the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. In addition, most tax jurisdictions

                                                                 I-61
that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services, cross-border payments
between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax, VAT and transfer tax. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities
in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any material differences
as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results
of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made.

     Because the majority of our subsidiaries have some or all of their ownership through U.S. corporations, our worldwide effective
tax rate is subject to provisions of U.S. tax law that defer the imposition of U.S. tax on certain foreign active income until that
income is repatriated to the U.S. Any repatriation, through our U.S. ownership structure, of assets currently held by subsidiaries
in foreign jurisdictions or recognition of income that fails to meet the U.S. tax requirements related to deferral of U.S. income tax,
may result in a higher effective tax rate for our company. While the company may mitigate this increase in its effective tax rate
through claiming a foreign tax credit against its U.S. federal income taxes or potentially have foreign or U.S. taxes reduced under
applicable income tax treaties, we are subject to various limitations.

     We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, including treaties
between the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions in which we have a presence. Also, various income tax proposals in the
jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are calculated. A change
in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher income or non-income
tax expense. Any such material changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate, such as the U.K.’s new corporate
rate to take effect in each of April 2017 and April 2020, as more fully described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements
included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the base erosion and
profit shifting (BEPS) project being undertaken by the OECD or the European Commission Anti-Tax Avoidance Package. The
OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that encompass most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the
European Commission have undertaken studies and are publishing action plans that include recommendations aimed at addressing
what they believe are issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by companies. It is possible that jurisdictions in
which we do business could react to these initiatives or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect
us or our shareholders through increasing our tax liabilities.

Factors Relating to Certain Financial Matters

     Our substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects. We seek to
maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek
to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that is between four
and five times our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. As a result, we are highly leveraged. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding
principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our capital lease obligations aggregated $43.6 billion, including $2,775.1
million that is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet and $38.5 billion that is not due until 2021 or thereafter. We
believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to
fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. As our debt maturities grow in later years, however, we
anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, we completed refinancing
transactions in 2016 that, among other things, resulted in the extension of certain of our subsidiaries’ debt maturities. No assurance
can be given that we will be able to complete additional refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this
regard, it is difficult to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory
developments will impact the credit and equity markets we access and our future financial position.

     Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements
and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted OIBDA of our
operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. For example, if
the Adjusted OIBDA of our subsidiary, UPC Broadband Holding, were to decline, we could be required to partially repay or limit
our borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with applicable covenants.
Accordingly, if our cash provided by operations declines or we encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required
to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come
due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund working capital needs,
acquisitions, property and equipment additions, or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any
additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or at all. Further,
our board of directors has approved share repurchase programs for our Liberty Global Shares and our LiLAC Shares. Any cash
                                                                  I-62
used by our company in connection with any future purchases of our ordinary shares would not be available for other purposes,
including the repayment of debt. For additional information concerning our share repurchase programs, see note 12 to our
consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various debt instruments that contain restrictions on how we finance our operations
and operate our businesses, which could impede our ability to engage in beneficial transactions. Certain of our subsidiaries are
subject to significant financial and operating restrictions contained in outstanding credit agreements, indentures and similar
instruments of indebtedness. These restrictions will affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things,
the ability of those subsidiaries to:

    •    incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

    •    pay dividends or make other upstream distributions;

    •    make investments;

    •    transfer, sell or dispose of certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

    •    merge or consolidate with other entities;

    •    engage in transactions with us or other affiliates; or

    •    create liens on their assets.

    As a result of restrictions contained in these debt instruments, the companies party thereto, and their subsidiaries, could be
unable to obtain additional capital in the future to:

    •    fund property and equipment additions or acquisitions that could improve their value;

    •    meet their loan and capital commitments to their business affiliates;

    •    invest in companies in which they would otherwise invest;

    •    fund any operating losses or future development of their business affiliates;

    •    obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize
         their assets; or

    •    conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities.

    In addition, most of the credit agreements to which these subsidiaries are parties include financial covenants that require them
to maintain certain financial ratios, including ratios of total debt to Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA to interest expense.
Their ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by adverse economic, competitive, or regulatory developments
and other events beyond their control, and we cannot assure you that these financial covenants will be met. In the event of a default
under such subsidiaries’ credit agreements or indentures, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under those
agreements or indentures, which could result in a default under other outstanding credit facilities or indentures. We cannot assure
you that any of these subsidiaries will have sufficient assets to pay indebtedness outstanding under their credit agreements and
indentures. Any refinancing of this indebtedness is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants.

     We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the debt service obligation of our subsidiaries.
We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries,
which are indexed to EURIBOR, LIBOR or other base rates. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage
exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost
or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market
interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated
with our leveraged capital structure.

    We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations. While
our operations attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in programming and operating costs, there is no
assurance that they will be able to do so. In certain countries in which we operate, our ability to increase subscription rates is
subject to regulatory controls. Also, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by competitive pressures.
Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and
                                                               I-63
net earnings (loss). We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs in
certain of our markets.

     Continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in the global economy and in the countries in which we operate may
adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current macroeconomic environment is highly
volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including the ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues,
the risk of deflation and the stability of the British pound sterling and the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic
environment. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of
measures by the E.U. Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the eurozone.
As a result, we cannot predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which we operate
may deteriorate. Additional risks arising from the ongoing economic challenges in Europe are described below under the Risk
Factor titled: We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our
liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.

     Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our subscribers and/or the prices we are able to charge
for our products and services, and, as a result, it may be (1) more difficult for us to attract new subscribers, (2) more likely that
subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (3) more difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Countries
may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our company.
Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, RGUs, mobile subscribers, Adjusted
OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic
environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse
effects.

     We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial
condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For
example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several countries in which we operate, combined with weak growth and
high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt
restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and
equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. With regard to currency instability issues,
concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect
to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific
fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the
exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries,
or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result in the
redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new
currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of our assets, liabilities and
cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination
event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would
likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone countries, which in turn could have
an adverse impact on demand for our products and services, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any
changes from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing and
other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a time frame that would
allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have
to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination
event could have a material adverse impact on our company.

     Additionally, we are facing a challenging economic environment in Puerto Rico due in part to the government’s liquidity
issues. In this regard, the Puerto Rico government has failed to make significant portions of its scheduled debt payments during
2016. Although the Puerto Rico government has implemented tax increases and other measures to improve its solvency and the
U.S. has implemented legislation designed to help manage Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, it remains possible, if not likely, that Puerto
Rico will be required to restructure its debt obligations. If the fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico were to worsen, the
population of Puerto Rico could continue to decline and the demand and ability of customers to pay for Liberty Puerto Rico’s
services could be impaired, both of which could have a negative impact on Liberty Puerto Rico’s results of operations, cash flows
and financial condition.

    We may not freely access the cash of our operating companies. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our
current sources of corporate liquidity include (1) our cash and cash equivalents and (2) interest and dividend income received on
our cash and cash equivalents and investments. From time to time, we also receive (1) proceeds in the form of distributions or
loan repayments from our subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets and

                                                                 I-64
(3) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity securities. The ability of our operating subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory,
regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and in some cases our receipt of such payments
or advances may be limited due to tax considerations or the presence of noncontrolling interests. Most of our operating subsidiaries
are subject to credit agreements or indentures that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the
making of distributions, loans or advances to shareholders and partners, including us. In addition, because these subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities they have no obligation to provide us funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends,
distributions, loans or other payments.

     We are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparties to our derivative and other financial instruments, undrawn debt
facilities and cash investments. Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our derivative and other financial
instruments, cash investments and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that our counterparties could default on their
obligations to us. Also, even though we regularly review our credit exposures, defaults may arise from events or circumstances
that are difficult to detect or foresee. At December 31, 2016, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (1) derivative assets
with an aggregate fair value of $2,424.6 million, (2) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,668.3 million and
(3) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of $3,969.2 million. While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness
of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, the current economic conditions and uncertainties in global
financial markets have increased the credit risk of our counterparties and we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of
our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect
on our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (1) the financial failure of any of our
counterparties could reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and adversely impact our ability to access cash
deposited with any failed financial institution, thereby causing a default under one or more derivative contracts, and (2) tightening
of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all. For additional
information on our derivative contracts, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

     The risks we would face in the event of a default by a counterparty to one of our derivative instruments might be eliminated
or substantially mitigated if we were able to novate the relevant derivative contracts to a new counterparty following the default
of our counterparty. While we anticipate that, in the event of the insolvency of one of our derivative counterparties, we would seek
to effect such novations, no assurance can be given that we would obtain the necessary consents to do so or that we would be able
to do so on terms or pricing that would be acceptable to us or that any such novation would not result in substantial costs to us.
Furthermore, the underlying risks that are the subject of the relevant derivative contracts would no longer be effectively hedged
due to the insolvency of our counterparty, unless and until we novate or replace the derivative contract.

     The liquidity and value of our interests in certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as the ability to make
decisions related to their operations, may be adversely affected by shareholder agreements and similar agreements to which
we are a party. We indirectly own equity interests in a variety of international video, broadband internet, telephony, mobile and
other communications businesses. Certain of these equity interests, such as our interests in our consolidated subsidiaries, Liberty
Puerto Rico, CWC Panama and CWC BTC, and our non-controlling interest in the Dutch JV, are held pursuant to shareholder
agreements, partnership agreements, joint venture agreements and other instruments and agreements that provide the terms of the
governance of the subsidiaries as well as the ownership of such interests. These agreements contain provisions that affect the
liquidity, and therefore the realizable value, of those interests by subjecting the transfer of such equity interests to consent rights
or rights of first refusal of the other shareholders or partners or similar restrictions on transfer. In certain cases, a change in control
of the subsidiary holding the equity interest will give rise to rights or remedies exercisable by other shareholders or partners. All
of these provisions will restrict the ability to sell those equity interests and may adversely affect the prices at which those interests
may be sold. Additionally, these agreements contain provisions granting us and the other shareholders or partners certain liquidity
rights as well as certain governance rights, for example, with respect to material matters, including but not limited to acquisitions,
mergers, dispositions, shareholder distributions, incurrence of debt, large expenditures and issuances of equity interests, which
may prevent the respective subsidiary from making decisions or taking actions that would protect or advance the interests of our
company, and could even result in such subsidiary making decisions or taking actions that adversely impact our company. For
instance, we and Searchlight each have certain liquidity rights in relation to Liberty Puerto Rico, including Searchlight’s ability,
after September 24, 2017 and so long as Searchlight owns at least 20% of Liberty Puerto Rico’s parent entities, to force a sale of
Liberty Puerto Rico or its parent entities, subject to certain conditions, including among others, our right of first offer and our
ability to stop a forced sale and instead conduce a dividend recapitalization in which Searchlight would receive cash. Furthermore,
our ability to access the cash of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries may be restricted in certain circumstances under the respective
shareholder, joint venture, partnership or similar agreements (see Item 1A. Risk Factors, We may not freely access the cash of our
operating companies).



                                                                   I-65
    We may not report net earnings. While we reported net earnings from continuing operations during 2016, we reported losses
from continuing operations of $1,049.5 million and $980.9 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. In light of our historical
financial performance, we cannot assure you that we will report net earnings in the near future.

Risks Related to Our Equity Capital Structure
     Holders of LiLAC Shares and Liberty Global Shares are shareholders of Liberty Global and are, therefore, subject to risks
associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both LiLAC Shares and Liberty Global
Shares. Even though we have attributed, for financial reporting purposes, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue,
expenses and cash flows to either the LiLAC Group or the Liberty Global Group in order to prepare the attributed financial
information for each of those groups, we retain legal title to all of our assets and our capitalization does not limit our legal
responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement schedules. Holders of LiLAC
Shares and Liberty Global Shares do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to either group and, in any
liquidation, holders of LiLAC Shares and Liberty Global Shares will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net
assets based on their respective numbers of liquidation units.
     Our board of directors’ ability to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities between the Liberty Global Group and the
LiLAC Group may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of the LiLAC Group and/or the Liberty Global Group based
on past performance. Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are
attributed to either the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group to the other group, without the approval of any of our shareholders.
Any such reattribution made by our board of directors, as well as the existence of the right in and of itself to effect a reattribution,
may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of either group, including liquidity and capital resource needs,
based on past performance. Shareholders may also have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of one group based
on past performance, as our board of directors may use the other group’s liquidity to fund such group’s liquidity and capital
expenditure requirements through the use of inter-group loans or other inter-group arrangements.
     We could be required to use assets attributed to one group to satisfy liabilities attributed to the other group. The assets
attributed to the LiLAC Group are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to the Liberty Global Group, even if those liabilities
arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to the Liberty Global Group. While our proposed management
and allocation policies provide that reattributions of assets between groups will result in the creation of an inter-group loan or an
inter-group interest or an offsetting reattribution of cash or other assets, no provision of our articles of association prevents us
from satisfying liabilities of the Liberty Global Group with assets of the LiLAC Group, and our creditors will not in any way be
limited by our equity capital structure from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have
such a structure. Holders of Liberty Global Shares may face similar considerations in that assets attributed to the Liberty Global
Group may be required to be used to satisfy liabilities attributed to the LiLAC Group.
     The market price of the ordinary shares of each group may not reflect the performance of the respective group. We cannot
assure you that the market price of the LiLAC Shares will, in fact, reflect the performance of the group of businesses, assets and
liabilities attributed to the LiLAC Group. Holders of LiLAC Shares are ordinary shareholders of our company as a whole and, as
such, are subject to all risks (and many of the corresponding benefits) associated with an investment in our company and all of
our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of each class of LiLAC Shares may be affected by the performance
or financial condition of our company as a whole. An adverse market reaction to events relating to the assets and businesses
attributed to the Liberty Global Group, such as earnings announcements or announcements of new products or services, acquisitions
or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may have an adverse effect on the market price of LiLAC Shares. Holders
of Liberty Global Shares may face similar considerations in that the price of the Liberty Global Shares may not reflect the
performance of the Liberty Global Group alone and may reflect the performance or financial condition of our company as a whole.
     The market price of LiLAC Shares may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially and could be affected by factors that do
not affect traditional ordinary shares. To the extent the market price of LiLAC Shares tracks the performance of more focused
groups of businesses, assets and liabilities than the Old Liberty Global Shares did prior to the LiLAC Transaction, the market
prices of any class of LiLAC Shares may be more volatile than the market price of Old Liberty Global Shares historically was.
The market price of LiLAC Shares could also be more sensitive to events or developments that are material only for the LiLAC
Group but would not be material for our company as a whole. The market price of LiLAC Shares may be materially affected by,
among other things:


      •     a potential discount that investors may apply because the LiLAC Shares are issued by a common enterprise, rather
            than a standalone company;

      •     actual or anticipated fluctuations in the LiLAC Group’s operating results or in the operating results of particular
            companies attributable to the group;

                                                                  I-66
      •     events or developments affecting the countries or regions in which the businesses attributed to the LiLAC Group
            operate;

      •     potential acquisition activity in the LiLAC Group;

      •     issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by us or the companies in which we invest and the manner in
            which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to the LiLAC Group;

      •     changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding the LiLAC Shares or the businesses attributed to the
            LiLAC Group;

      •     the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of the LiLAC Shares,
            as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in our shares;

      •     the lack of market familiarity with tracking shares issued by an English publicly-traded company and of directly
            applicable legal precedent, given we are not aware of any other English publicly-traded company that has issued
            such shares; and

      •     general market conditions.

     We have not historically paid any cash dividends, and we may not pay dividends equally or at all on any class of our
ordinary shares. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on any class of our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future.
However, we have the right to pay dividends, effect securities distributions or make bonus issues on the shares of each of the
Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends, effect securities distributions
or make bonus issues on the shares of one group and not pay dividends, effect securities distributions or make bonus issues on shares
of the other group. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to either group will reduce our
“distributable reserves” (defined as our accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses, as measured for U.K.
statutory purposes) legally available to be paid as dividends by our company under English law on any of our ordinary shares,
including on the ordinary shares relating to the other group.

     The fiduciary requirements on our board of directors may in certain circumstances mean that our board of directors makes
decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of our shares or that have a disparate impact on holders of any of
our shares. Our equity capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of Liberty Global Shares might
diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of LiLAC Shares. The Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group are
not separate entities and thus holders of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares do not have the right to elect separate boards
of directors. As a result, our company’s directors owe fiduciary duties under English law to our company as a whole as opposed
to only particular shareholders or groups of shareholders, provided that the board’s actions are not found to be unfairly prejudicial
to a shareholder’s interests. Decisions deemed to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole
or otherwise deemed to be in the best interest of our company and all of our shareholders could be viewed as not being in the best
interest of particular shareholders or groups of shareholders when considered independently. Examples include:


      •     decisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the Liberty Global Group and the
            LiLAC Group or the terms of any reattributions of businesses, assets and liabilities between the groups;

      •     decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares, or
            among the classes of shares relating to either of our groups, to be received in connection with a scheme of arrangement
            involving our company;

      •     decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might
            meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;

      •     decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to
            the other;

      •     decisions resulting in the redesignation, or conversion, of LiLAC Shares into Liberty Global Shares or deferred shares;


                                                                I-67
      •     decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any inter-group interest or
            loan that one group may have in or to the other group;

      •     decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of our groups;

      •     decisions as to the dispositions of assets of either of our groups; and

      •     decisions as to the payment of dividends on the shares or share buybacks relating to either of our groups.

     Our directors’ or officers’ ownership of LiLAC Shares and Liberty Global Shares may create or appear to create conflicts
of interest. If our directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in LiLAC Shares or Liberty
Global Shares, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could
have different implications for the holders of LiLAC Shares or Liberty Global Shares.

     Our management and allocation policies give our board of directors significant discretion. Our board of directors has
adopted, after shareholder approval, certain management and allocation policies to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding
the relationships between the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits,
inter-group loans, inter-group interests, attribution of assets, financing alternatives, corporate opportunities, payment of dividends
and similar items. Our management and allocation policies give our board of directors significant discretion and are subject to
change by the board of directors without further shareholder approval. Under these policies, the board of directors has discretion
with respect to the recognition or adjustment of inter-group interests that the Liberty Global Group may be treated as holding in
the LiLAC Group. The board’s discretion also extends to determining if, how and to what extent such inter-group interests will
be taken into account in connection with any dividend or other distribution on the LiLAC Shares, redesignation, or conversion,
of LiLAC Shares or any other transaction affecting the LiLAC Shares. In making such determination, our board of directors may
consider any factor that it deems appropriate, including without limitation, the tax effects of any event or transaction or the use
of tax benefits. All determinations made by our board of directors in this regard will be final and binding on all holders of our
ordinary shares. The broad discretion that these policies accord our board of directors also extends to other matters, including how
future corporate opportunities that may present themselves in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe or elsewhere will be allocated
between the LiLAC Group and the Liberty Global Group.

      Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, elect to redesignate, or convert, all of the LiLAC Shares into Liberty
Global Shares, thereby changing the nature of the investment of holders of LiLAC Shares and possibly diluting their economic
interest in our company, which could result in a loss of value to them. Our articles of association permit our board of directors,
in its sole discretion, to redesignate, or convert, all of the LiLAC Shares into Liberty Global Shares. There is no current plan or
intention to redesignate, or convert, the LiLAC Shares into Liberty Global Shares. Our board of directors may elect to exercise
this authority at any time if it determines that such redesignation is in the best interests of the company and all of our shareholders.
This could occur, for example, if our board of directors determines that the aggregate equity valuation of our company would be
increased by eliminating the separate LiLAC Shares, or in connection with a sale or other strategic transaction. In addition, our
board may determine to effect such redesignation in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the LiLAC
Group. A redesignation would preclude the holders of LiLAC Shares from retaining their investment in a security that is intended
to reflect separately the performance of the LiLAC Group, and result in holders of Liberty Global Shares having an investment
that includes businesses, assets and liabilities that may not fit their investment objectives. We cannot predict the impact on the
market value of our shares of (1) our board of directors’ ability to effect any such redesignation or (2) the exercise of this
redesignation right by our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors may effect such a redesignation at a time when
the market value of our shares could cause the holders of the LiLAC Shares to be disadvantaged.

      Under certain circumstances, including in connection with a distribution to holders of LiLAC Shares of securities of
another corporation, we may reduce the number of LiLAC Shares proportionally, thereby reducing the voting power and
liquidity of such shares. Our articles of association permit us to reduce the number of LiLAC Shares in connection with certain
transactions, including a distribution to holders of LiLAC Shares of securities of another corporation or a distribution to holders
of LiLAC Shares following a disposition of the LiLAC Group. We expect that our board of directors would exercise this authority,
in its discretion, in connection with a distribution to holders of LiLAC Shares that would materially reduce the amount of assets
attributed to the LiLAC Group. The purpose of reducing the number of LiLAC Shares in this case would be to readjust the per
share valuation and the aggregate voting power of the LiLAC Shares to reflect the value of the assets attributed to the LiLAC
Group following such transaction. Such reduction would further decrease the aggregate voting power of the LiLAC Shares as
compared to the Liberty Global Shares. We cannot predict the impact on the market value of LiLAC Shares of the possibility of
any such reduction in the number of such shares, including any potential effects resulting from reduced liquidity of the remaining
LiLAC Shares.

                                                                 I-68
      A third-party could acquire control of our company pursuant to an offer to acquire some or all of the Liberty Global
Shares only, leaving holders of LiLAC Shares as minority shareholders. An offer to acquire shares in our company may be
structured such that the offer is made to acquire only the Liberty Global Shares. If such an acquisition of Liberty Global Shares
is successful, this would result in the holders of the LiLAC Shares not sharing in any control premium paid to holders of the Liberty
Global Shares. In that case, holders of LiLAC Shares would continue to be minority shareholders of a company with a third-party
majority shareholder, with no ability to vote against such a change, participate in such offer or otherwise realize any control
premium.

     Holders of Liberty Global Shares or LiLAC Shares may receive less consideration upon a sale of all or substantially all
of the assets attributed to that group than if that group were a separate company. We cannot assure you whether the per share
consideration to be paid to holders of Liberty Global Shares or LiLAC Shares in connection with a sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group, as applicable, will be equal to or more than the per share value of
that share prior to or after the announcement of such a sale. In addition, if the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group were a
separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level
or withholding or other cross-border taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, shareholders of
a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the holders of Liberty
Global Shares or LiLAC Shares, as applicable, would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to such
group. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of the shares relating to that group.
Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group, the holders
of the Liberty Global Shares or LiLAC Shares, as applicable, could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in our company.

       Certain protections that our articles of association provide to holders of LiLAC Shares in connection with a sale of not
less than 80% of the fair value of the assets of, or equity interests in, the LiLAC Group may not apply if we do not have sufficient
distributable reserves or share premium available following such disposition. Our articles of association provide that in
connection with a disposition of not less than 80% of the fair value of the assets of, or equity interests in, the LiLAC Group, subject
to certain exempt dispositions, our board of directors will be required to distribute cash or other assets with a fair value equal to
the available net proceeds of such disposition to holders of LiLAC Shares (with or without a concurrent proportional reduction
in the number of outstanding LiLAC Shares), redesignate, or convert, a portion of LiLAC Shares into Liberty Global Shares at a
10% premium, or do a combination of the foregoing. However, our company’s ability to take any of such actions at the time may
depend (and in the case of a dividend or other distribution, will depend) on the availability of sufficient distributable reserves for
the payment of a dividend or other distribution or sufficient share premium required for the creation of additional shares. If sufficient
distributable reserves or share premium are not available at the time of the disposition, our board of directors will be permitted to
effect the disposition without distributing an amount equal to the net proceeds of such disposition to holders of LiLAC Shares or
redesignating LiLAC Shares into Liberty Global Shares, subject to the board’s fiduciary duties.

     In the event of a liquidation of Liberty Global, neither holders of Liberty Global Shares nor holders of LiLAC Shares will
have priority with respect to the assets attributed to the respective group remaining for distribution to shareholders. Under our
articles of association, upon Liberty Global’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the LiLAC Shares will be entitled
to receive, in respect of their respective shares, their proportionate interest in all of Liberty Global’s assets, if any, remaining for
distribution to holders of ordinary shares in proportion to their respective number of “liquidation units.” Pursuant to the terms of
our articles of association, the liquidation units for each Liberty Global Share and each LiLAC Share are 1 and 0.94893, respectively.
Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of LiLAC Shares upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Liberty Global
will not directly relate to the value of the assets attributed to the LiLAC Group and will not reflect changes in the relative value
of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group over time. Holders of the Liberty Global Shares may face similar considerations
in the event of a liquidation in that any distribution to them upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up may not directly relate
to the value of the assets attributed to the Liberty Global Group and will not reflect changes to the relative values of the groups
over time.

     Holders of LiLAC Shares have separate voting rights only on a limited set of matters and could be outvoted by holders of
Liberty Global Shares on all other matters. Holders of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares vote together as a single class,
except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by our articles of association or as required by English law. Each Class B
ordinary share of each group has ten votes, and each Class A ordinary share of each group has one vote. Holders of Class C ordinary
shares of each group have no voting rights at general meetings of the company or meetings of all of the shares relating to one group.
When holders of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes
(or 75%, in the case of a vote requiring a special resolution) present and voting will be in a position to control the outcome of the
vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our shareholders or has a greater impact on one group than the other.
As of February 10, 2017, holders of Liberty Global Shares collectively directed approximately 84.0% of the aggregate voting
power in our company, and holders of LiLAC Shares collectively directed approximately 16.0% of the aggregate voting power
in our company.
                                                                 I-69
       Our equity capital structure, as well as the fact that the LiLAC Group and the Liberty Global Group are not independent
companies, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for either group and may make it difficult for a third-party to acquire us,
even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. If the LiLAC Group and the Liberty Global Group were separate
independent companies, any person interested in acquiring the LiLAC Group or the Liberty Global Group without negotiating
with management could seek control of that group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting shares, by means of a tender
offer, or by means of a scheme of arrangement. Although we intend for the LiLAC Shares to reflect the separate economic
performance of the LiLAC Group, neither the LiLAC Group nor the Liberty Global Group are separate entities, and a person
interested in acquiring only one group without negotiating with our management could obtain control of that group only by
obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding voting shares of our company. The existence of shares,
and different classes of shares, relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles,
financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have capital structures similar to ours.

Other Factors

    The loss of certain key personnel could harm our business. We have experienced employees at both the corporate and
operational levels who possess substantial knowledge of our business and operations. We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue
costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions in our business operations,
which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

     John C. Malone has significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our shareholders. John C.
Malone beneficially owns outstanding ordinary shares of Liberty Global representing 25.4% of our aggregate voting power as of
February 10, 2017. By virtue of Mr. Malone’s voting power in our company, as well as his position as Chairman of our board of
directors, Mr. Malone may have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to
our shareholders for approval. For example, under English law and our articles of association, certain matters (including
amendments to the articles of association) require the approval of 75% of the shareholders who vote (in person or by proxy) on
the relevant resolution, and other certain corporate transactions or matters may require the approval of at least 75% of the outstanding
shares of each class of our ordinary shares. Because Mr. Malone beneficially owns approximately 25.4% of our aggregate voting
power and more than 75% of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares of each of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group,
he has the ability to prevent the requisite approval threshold from being met even though the other shareholders may determine
that such action or transaction is beneficial for the Company. Mr. Malone’s rights to vote or dispose of his equity interests in our
company are not subject to any restrictions in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary
transfer restrictions pursuant to equity award agreements.

    It may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions
of our articles of association and of English law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company that a
shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:

    •    authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of ordinary shares; two tracking groups, each with a Class B that
         entitles the holders to 10 votes per share; a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share; and a Class C that,
         except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;

    •    authorizing the issuance of “blank check” shares (both ordinary and preference), which could be issued by our board of
         directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;

    •    classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control
         of our board of directors, although under English law, shareholders of our company can remove a director without cause
         by ordinary resolution;

    •    prohibiting shareholder action by written resolution, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of
         the shareholders;

    •    requiring the approval of 75% in value of the shareholders (or class of shareholders) and/or English court approval for
         certain statutory mergers or schemes of arrangements; and

    •    establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for
         proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.




                                                                 I-70
     Change in control provisions in our incentive plans and related award agreements or in executive employment agreements
may also discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company, even if such change of control would be in the best
interests of our shareholders.

     The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult. Because we are a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S.
courts than would currently be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. It may also be more difficult (or
impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts sitting in England than it would be to bring similar claims against
a U.S. company in a U.S. court. In particular, English law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of
English companies may bring derivative actions. Under English law generally, only the Company can be the proper plaintiff in
proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against us. Our articles of association provide for the exclusive jurisdiction of
the English courts for shareholder lawsuits against us or our directors.

Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

    None.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

    During 2016, we leased our corporate offices in London, U.K., in Denver, Colorado, U.S. and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
We also own our sub-sea network in the Caribbean. All of our other real or personal property is owned or leased by our subsidiaries
and affiliates.

     Our subsidiaries and affiliates own or lease the fixed assets necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, including
office space, transponder space, headend facilities, rights of way, cable television and telecommunications distribution equipment,
telecommunications switches, base stations, cell towers and customer premises equipment and other property necessary for their
operations. The physical components of their broadband networks require maintenance and periodic upgrades to support the new
services and products they introduce. Subject to these maintenance and upgrade activities, our management believes that our
current facilities are suitable and adequate for our business operations for the foreseeable future.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, our subsidiaries and affiliates have become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of their
operations in the normal course of business. For additional information, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in
Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

(a)       On July 1, 2015, in connection with the issuance of LiLAC Shares pursuant to the LiLAC Transaction, we reclassified our
          then outstanding Old Liberty Global Shares into corresponding classes of Liberty Global Shares. Consistent with the
          treatment of the LiLAC Transaction in our consolidated financial statements, the share price information of Old Liberty
          Global Shares for periods prior to July 1, 2015 has not been retroactively revised.

(b)       On July 1, 2016, we completed the LiLAC Distribution. The share price information presented herein for periods prior to
          July 1, 2016 has not been retroactively revised. Prices for LiLAC Class B ordinary shares reflect inter-dealer prices without
          retail mark-up, mark-down or actual transactions
                                                                    II-1

(a)     Amounts do not include the number of shareholders whose shares are nominally held by banks, brokerage houses or other
        institutions, but include each such institution as one record holder.

Dividends

     We have not paid any cash dividends on any of our ordinary shares, and we have no present intention of doing so. Any future
payment of cash dividends will be determined by our board of directors in light of our earnings, financial condition and other
relevant considerations including applicable laws in England and Wales. Except as noted below, there are currently no contractual
restrictions on our ability to pay dividends in cash or shares. The credit facilities to which certain of our subsidiaries are parties
restrict our ability to access their cash for, among other things, our payment of cash dividends.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities

      None.

Overview

  General

     We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services, with consolidated
operations at December 31, 2016 in more than 30 countries. We provide residential and B2B services in (i) the U.K. and Ireland
through Virgin Media, (ii) Germany through Unitymedia, (iii) Belgium through Telenet and (iv) seven other European countries
through UPC Holding. In addition, through the December 31, 2016 completion of the Dutch JV Transaction, we provided residential
and B2B services in the Netherlands through Ziggo Group Holding. The operations of Virgin Media, Unitymedia, Telenet, UPC
Holding and, through December 31, 2016, Ziggo Group Holding are collectively referred to herein as the “European Division.”
In addition, we provide residential and B2B services in (a) 18 countries, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean,
through CWC, (b) Chile through VTR and (c) Puerto Rico through Liberty Puerto Rico. CWC also provides (1) B2B services in
certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (2) wholesale services over its sub-sea and terrestrial networks
that connect over 30 markets in that region. The operations of CWC, VTR and Liberty Puerto Rico are collectively referred to
herein as the “LiLAC Division.” In the following discussion and analysis, the term “LiLAC Group” refers to our operations in
Latin American and the Caribbean, and the term “Liberty Global Group” refers to our operations not attributed to the LiLAC
Group. For additional information regarding the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, see note 1 to our consolidated
financial statements.

  Operations

    At December 31, 2016, we owned and operated networks that passed 49,868,900 homes and served 50,159,700 revenue
generating units (RGUs), consisting of 20,198,100 video subscribers, 16,357,500 broadband internet subscribers and 13,604,100
fixed-line telephony subscribers. In addition, at December 31, 2016, we served 10,256,800 mobile subscribers.




                                                                 II-8
    The following table provides details of our organic RGU and mobile subscriber changes for the years indicated. The subscriber

_______________

(a)      Includes organic changes of Ziggo Group Holding through the December 31, 2016 completion of the Dutch JV Transaction.

     Video services. We provide video services in most of our residential markets and, for most of our customers, we have enhanced
our video offerings with various products that enable such customers to control when they watch their programming. These products
range from digital video recorders to multimedia home gateway systems capable of distributing video, voice and data content
throughout the home and to multiple devices.

    Broadband internet services. In all of our broadband communications markets, we offer multiple tiers of broadband internet
service with available maximum download speeds as high as 500 Mbps or more depending on location. We continue to invest in
new technologies that allow us to increase the internet speeds we offer to our customers.

   Fixed-line telephony services. We offer fixed-line telephony services in substantially all of our broadband communications
markets, via either voice-over-internet-protocol or “VoIP” technology or circuit-switched telephony, depending on location.

      Mobile services. We offer voice and data mobile services through MVNO networks or our own networks in most of our
broadband communications markets. We offer mobile services as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Germany,
Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and Chile. Following the February 2016 acquisition of BASE, Telenet became
a mobile network provider in Belgium and plans to migrate its mobile subscribers to the BASE network prior to the termination
of its MVNO agreement at the end of 2018. We are a mobile network provider in Panama and many Caribbean markets, including
the Bahamas and Jamaica.

    B2B services. Most of our operations also provide B2B services, including voice, broadband internet, data, video, wireless
and cloud services.

   For additional information regarding the details of our products and services, see Item 1. Business included in Part I of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Strategy and management focus

    From a strategic perspective, we are seeking to build broadband communications and mobile businesses that have strong
prospects for future growth. As discussed further under Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization below, we also seek to
maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk.

                                                                                            II-9
     We strive to achieve organic revenue and customer growth in our operations by developing and marketing bundled
entertainment and information and communications services, and extending and upgrading the quality of our networks where
appropriate. As we use the term, organic growth excludes foreign currency translation effects (FX) and the estimated impact of
acquisitions. While we seek to increase our customer base, we also seek to maximize the average revenue we receive from each
household by increasing the penetration of our digital video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services with
existing customers through product bundling and upselling.

     During 2015, we initiated a network extension program in the U.K., which was subsequently expanded to include Ireland.
During 2016, we initiated network extension programs in Central and Eastern Europe, Germany, Chile and certain other markets.
We collectively refer to these network extension programs as the “Network Extensions.” The Network Extensions will be
completed in phases with priority given to the most accretive expansion opportunities. During 2015 and 2016, we connected
567,000 homes and commercial premises to Virgin Media’s two-way network (including technical upgrades in the U.K.). During
2016, we connected approximately one million homes and commercial premises (including upgrades in Germany and Chile) to
our two-way networks in the other markets mentioned above. Pursuant to the Network Extensions, we expect in 2017 to (i) connect
1.3 million to 1.4 million additional homes and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks attributed
to the Liberty Global Group and (ii) connect or upgrade approximately 450,000 additional homes and commercial premises to our
two-way networks attributed to the LiLAC Group. Depending on a variety of factors, including the financial and operational results
of the programs, the Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion.

     The capital costs associated with the Network Extensions, which include the costs to build out the networks and the purchase
and installation of related customer premises equipment, are expected to be significant. For information regarding our expectations
with regard to the percentage of revenue represented by the property and equipment additions of the Liberty Global Group and
the LiLAC Group during 2017, see Liquidity and Capital Resources — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.

     During 2015, we initiated our “Liberty Go” program, which is a comprehensive plan to drive top-line growth while maintaining
tight cost controls. The Liberty Go program seeks to capitalize on revenue opportunities associated with the Network Extensions,
mobile and B2B, together with the realization of greater efficiencies by leveraging our scale more effectively. Underpinning this
program is a commitment to customer centricity, which we believe is key to succeeding in an ever more demanding consumer
market. We expect this program to continue through 2018 and that the successful implementation of Liberty Go will lead to
consolidated organic growth rates for revenue and Adjusted OIBDA that are meaningfully higher than our recent consolidated
organic growth rates.

     Our assessment of the impacts of the Liberty Go program and the Network Extensions are subject to competitive, economic,
regulatory and other factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that we will be successful in delivering growth
rates that are meaningfully higher than our recent consolidated organic growth rates for revenue and Adjusted OIBDA.

  Competition and other external factors

     We are experiencing significant competition from incumbent telecommunications operators, DTH operators and/or other
providers in all of our markets. In the Bahamas, where CWC previously was the only provider of mobile services, competition
has increased significantly due to the commercial launch of mobile services by a competitor during the fourth quarter of 2016. In
addition, two new fixed-line competitors have entered the market in Trinidad and Tobago. In certain of its markets, CWC is also
experiencing increased regulatory intervention that would, if implemented, facilitate increased competition. For additional
information regarding the competition we face, see Item 1. Business - Competition and - Regulatory Matters included in Part I of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This significant competition, together with macroeconomic factors, has adversely impacted
our revenue, RGUs and/or average monthly subscription revenue per average cable RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable
(ARPU), particularly in the Netherlands, Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago. For additional information regarding
the revenue impact of changes in the RGUs and ARPU of our reportable segments, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable
Segments below.

     In addition to competition, our operations are subject to macroeconomic, political and other risks that are outside of our
control. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which U.K. citizens voted in favor of, on an advisory basis, an exit from
the E.U. commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least
two years after the British government formally initiates a withdrawal process pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on Europe. The
British government has indicated that it plans to commence negotiations to determine the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from
the E.U. by the end of March 2017. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services,
people and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt
trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations (including the U.S.) as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. The
initial impact of the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets, including in the prices of our
                                                               II-10
shares. In addition, the U.S. dollar has significantly strengthened against the British pound sterling during the period following
Brexit. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

     In early October 2016, our fixed-line and mobile networks in the Bahamas suffered extensive damage as a result of Hurricane
Matthew. Although many of our customers experienced significant outages as a result of Hurricane Matthew, service to the majority
of our fixed-line and mobile subscribers has now been restored. We estimate that Hurricane Matthew resulted in reductions to our
revenue and Adjusted OIBDA in the Bahamas during the fourth quarter of 2016 of $2 million and $4 million, respectively. In
addition, we estimate that property and equipment additions required to repair our fixed-line and mobile networks in the Bahamas
will aggregate up to $40 million, of which $22 million was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. Although we expect the
adverse impacts on our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA from Hurricane Matthew to continue during 2017, we expect these impacts
to progressively decline over the course of the year. Although we have property and business interruption insurance that we expect
will cover a significant portion of our Hurricane Matthew losses, no assurance can be given as to the amount and timing of the
insurance proceeds that we will ultimately recover.

     We are facing a challenging economic environment in Puerto Rico due in part to the government’s liquidity issues. In this
regard, the Puerto Rico government failed to make significant portions of its scheduled debt payments during 2016. Although the
Puerto Rico government has implemented tax increases and other measures to improve its solvency and the U.S. has implemented
legislation designed to help manage Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, it remains possible, if not likely, that Puerto Rico will be required
to restructure its debt obligations. If the fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico were to worsen, the population of Puerto
Rico could continue to decline and the demand and ability of customers to pay for Liberty Puerto Rico’s services could be impaired,
both of which could have a negative impact on Liberty Puerto Rico’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

     In addition, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several countries in which we operate, combined with weak growth
and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt
restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and
equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. The occurrence of any of these events,
especially within the eurozone countries given our significant exposure to the euro and pound sterling, could have an adverse
impact on, among other matters, our liquidity and cash flows.

Results of Operations

     We have completed a number of transactions that impact the comparability of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 results of operations,
including the CWC Acquisition on May 16, 2016, the BASE Acquisition on February 11, 2016, the Choice Acquisition on June
3, 2015, the Ziggo Acquisition on November 11, 2014 and a number of less significant acquisitions during 2016, 2015 and 2014.

     On December 31, 2016, we completed the Dutch JV Transaction, whereby we contributed Ziggo Group Holding and its
subsidiaries (including Ziggo Sport) to the Dutch JV. Accordingly, our results of operations include the operations of Ziggo Group
Holding and its subsidiaries for all periods presented while our December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet excludes such
entities. In our segment presentation, Ziggo Group Holding (exclusive of Ziggo Sport, which became a subsidiary of Ziggo Group
Holding in October 2016) is separately reported as “The Netherlands” and Ziggo Sport is included in our “Corporate and Other”
category. For additional information regarding the Dutch JV Transaction, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

    For further information regarding our pending and completed acquisitions, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

      In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of acquisitions (the Acquisition Impact) on our operating
results. The Acquisition Impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results of the periods under
comparison that is attributable to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the Acquisition Impact on an acquired entity’s
operating results during the first three to six months following the acquisition date, as adjusted to remove integration costs and
any other material unusual or nonoperational items, such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are
considered to be organic changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, (i) variances attributed to an acquired entity during
the first 12 months following the acquisition date represent differences between the Acquisition Impact and the actual results and
(ii) the calculation of our organic growth percentages includes the organic growth of an acquired entity relative to the Acquisition
Impact of such entity. During 2016, we changed how we calculate our organic growth percentages to include the Acquisition
Impact in the denominator of the calculation, as this methodology takes into account the size of the acquired entity's operations
relative to our existing operations. This change has been reflected retroactively for all periods presented herein. Notwithstanding
the above and due largely to the fact that CWC represents a new reportable segment, we have excluded all of CWC’s operating
results (excluding $9.9 million of integration costs that are included in the organic change for SG&A expenses and Adjusted
OIBDA) for the period from the May 16, 2016 acquisition date through December 31, 2016 from the calculation of organic growth.

                                                               II-11
     Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as all of our operating
segments, except for CWC and Puerto Rico, have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to FX
risk during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was to the euro and British pound sterling as 43.2% and 27.5% of our
reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and British pound
sterling, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for other local
currencies in Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America. The portions of the changes in the various components of our results of
operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and
Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below. For information concerning our foreign currency risks and
the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the periods covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below.

     The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100% of each reportable segment’s revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. As
we have the ability to control Telenet, Liberty Puerto Rico and certain subsidiaries of CWC that are not wholly owned, we
consolidate 100% of the revenue and expenses of these entities in our consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that
third parties own significant interests in these entities. The noncontrolling owners’ interests in the operating results of Telenet,
Liberty Puerto Rico, certain subsidiaries of CWC and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings
or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations.




                                                               II-12
Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments

  General

     All of the reportable segments set forth below derive their revenue primarily from (i) broadband communications services,
including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services, (ii) B2B services and (iii) with the exception of Puerto
Rico, mobile services. For detailed information regarding the composition of our reportable segments, see note 18 to our
consolidated financial statements.

     The tables presented below in this section provide a separate analysis of each of the line items that comprise Adjusted OIBDA,
as further discussed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements, as well as an analysis of Adjusted OIBDA by reportable
segment for (i) 2016, as compared to 2015, and (ii) 2015, as compared to 2014. These tables present (a) the amounts reported by
each of our reportable segments for the current and comparative periods, (b) the reported U.S. dollar change and percentage change
from period to period and (c) the organic U.S. dollar change and percentage change from period to period (percentage change
after removing FX and the estimated impacts of acquisitions and dispositions). The comparisons that exclude FX assume that
exchange rates remained constant at the prior year rate during the comparative periods that are included in each table. As discussed
under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below, we have significant exposure
to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We also provide a table showing the Adjusted OIBDA margins of our reportable
segments for 2016, 2015 and 2014 at the end of this section.

     The revenue of our reportable segments includes revenue earned from (i) subscribers to our broadband communication and
other fixed-line and DTH services (collectively referred to herein as “cable subscription revenue”) and our mobile services and
(ii) B2B services, interconnect fees, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fees, installation fees, late fees and advertising
revenue. Consistent with the presentation of our revenue categories in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements, we use
the term “subscription revenue” in the following discussion to refer to amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services,
excluding installation fees and late fees. In the following tables, mobile subscription revenue excludes the related interconnect
revenue.

     Most of our revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer VAT or similar revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these
taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such
tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience
increases in our operating costs and expenses and corresponding declines in our Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margins
to the extent of any such tax increases.

     We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers terminate on
another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from their customers terminate on
our networks or networks that we access through MVNO or other arrangements. The amounts we charge and incur with respect
to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are subject to regulatory oversight in many of our markets. To the extent
that regulatory authorities introduce fixed-line or mobile termination rate changes, we would experience prospective changes and,
in very limited cases, we could experience retroactive changes in our interconnect revenue and/or costs. The ultimate impact of
any such changes in termination rates on our Adjusted OIBDA would be dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are
subject to the changed termination rates.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

    General. While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our reportable segments,
we are experiencing significant competition in all of our markets. This competition has an adverse impact on our ability to increase
or maintain our RGUs and/or ARPU.

     Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of RGUs
or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (a) changes
in prices, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber
usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of cable and mobile products during the period. In the following discussion, we discuss
ARPU changes in terms of the net impact of the above factors on the ARPU that is derived from our video, broadband internet,
fixed-line telephony and mobile products.
                                                                        II-14
    U.K./Ireland. The decrease in U.K./Ireland’s revenue during 2016, as compared to 2015, includes (i) an organic increase of
$195.5 million or 2.8%, (ii) the impact of acquisitions, (iii) the impact of disposals and (iv) the impact of FX, as set forth below:

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to the net
         effect of (i) an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs in the U.K., (ii) an increase in the average
         number of fixed-line telephony RGUs and (iii) declines in the average number of enhanced video RGUs and, to a much
         lesser extent, the average number of basic video RGUs in Ireland.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a
         net increase primarily due to (a) higher ARPU from broadband internet services, (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony
         services in the U.K., (c) lower ARPU resulting from the impact of a change in the regulations governing payment handling
         fees that Virgin Media charges to its customers in the U.K., which reduced revenue by $29.4 million, and (d) higher ARPU
         from video services, as an increase in the U.K. was only partially offset by a decrease in Ireland, and (ii) an adverse change
         in RGU mix.

(c)      The decrease in mobile subscription revenue relates to the net effect of (i) lower ARPU in the U.K., including a decline of
         $105.3 million in postpaid mobile services revenue associated with the U.K. Split-contract Program, (ii) an increase in the
         average number of mobile subscribers, as an increase in the average number of postpaid mobile subscribers more than offset
         the decrease in the average number of prepaid mobile subscribers in the U.K., and (iii) a decrease in revenue due to the
         impact of a $4.2 million favorable adjustment to VAT recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015. For additional information
         regarding Split-contract Programs, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in data revenue, primarily attributable to
         (a) higher volumes and (b) an increase of $13.1 million in the U.K.’s amortization of deferred upfront fees on B2B contracts,
         (ii) lower voice revenue in the U.K., primarily attributable to (1) a decrease in revenue due to the impact of a $17.4 million
         favorable adjustment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of disputes with mobile operators
         over amounts charged for voice traffic, including $15.6 million related to years prior to 2015, (2) a decline in usage and
         (3) lower wholesale revenue, and (iii) an increase in low-margin equipment sales in the U.K.

(e)      The increase in other revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales, primarily attributable
         to an increase of $63.5 million associated with the U.K. Split-contract Program, (ii) a decrease in interconnect revenue in
         the U.K. of $17.0 million, primarily due to (a) a decline in mobile short message service (SMS) termination volumes and
         (b) lower fixed-line telephony termination volumes, (iii) an increase in broadcasting revenue in Ireland and (iv) an increase
         in installation revenue in the U.K. The increase in revenue from the U.K. Split-contract Program is due to the net effect of
         (1) increased volume and (2) lower average revenue per handset sold.


                                                                                            II-15

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs that were only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) higher ARPU from video,
         broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of postpaid
         mobile subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU, primarily due to (a) a decline of $12.4 million in mobile services revenue due to
         the June 2015 introduction of a Split-contract Program and (b) a decline in usage.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is largely due to the net impact of (i) higher revenue from information technology security
         services and related equipment sales, (ii) lower revenue from mobile services and (iii) higher revenue from data services.

(e)      The increase in other revenue is primarily due to (i) an increase of $6.5 million in mobile handset sales, (ii) an increase in
         set-top box sales, (iii) an increase in tablet sales and (iv) an increase in mobile interconnect revenue due to the net effect
         of (a) growth in mobile call volumes and (b) lower SMS usage. The increase in Belgium’s mobile handset sales, which
         typically generate relatively low or negative margins, include the net impact of (1) an increase of $11.4 million in non-
         subsidized handset sales, including an increase of $5.3 million associated with the June 2015 introduction of a Split-contract
         Program, and (2) a net decrease of $4.9 million in other handset sales.

    Certain recent governmental actions in Belgium require that purchasers of prepaid mobile cards identify themselves. This
requirement may have an adverse impact on our prepaid mobile subscriber base and revenue in Belgium. For information concerning
another regulatory development that could have an adverse impact on our revenue in Belgium, see note 17 to our consolidated
financial statements.

_______________

(a)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to declines
         in the average numbers of basic video, enhanced video and fixed-line telephony RGUs that were only partially offset by
         an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a net decrease
         due to (a) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services and (b) higher ARPU from video services
         and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU.

(d)      The decrease in B2B revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower revenue from voice services and (ii) higher
         revenue from data services.

(e)      The increase in other revenue includes the net effect of (i) a $3.3 million increase due to the favorable settlement of prior

(a)      Subscription revenue includes revenue from multi-year bulk agreements with landlords or housing associations or with
         third parties that operate and administer the in-building networks on behalf of housing associations. These bulk agreements,
         which generally allow for the procurement of the basic video signals at volume-based discounts, provide access to
         approximately two-thirds of Germany’s video subscribers. Germany’s bulk agreements are, to a significant extent, medium-
         and long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2016, bulk agreements covering approximately 31% of the video subscribers
         that Germany serves expire by the end of 2017 or are terminable on 30-days notice. During the three months ended
         December 31, 2016, Germany’s 20 largest bulk agreement accounts generated approximately 8% of its total revenue
         (including estimated amounts billed directly to the building occupants for digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line
         telephony services). No assurance can be given that Germany’s bulk agreements will be renewed or extended on financially
         equivalent terms, or at all.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that were only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(c)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due to (a) higher
         ARPU from broadband internet and video services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an
         improvement in RGU mix.

(d)      Other revenue includes fees received for the carriage of certain channels included in Germany’s basic and enhanced video
         offerings. This channel carriage fee revenue is subject to contracts that expire or are otherwise terminable by either party
         on various dates ranging from 2017 through 2020. The aggregate amount of revenue related to these channel carriage
         contracts represented approximately 4% of Germany’s total revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2016.
         No assurance can be given that these contracts will be renewed or extended on financially equivalent terms, or at all. In
         June 2017, we plan to discontinue our analog video service in Germany. We estimate that the discontinuance of this service
         will reduce Germany’s channel carriage revenue and operating income by approximately €30 million ($32 million) annually.

(e)      The increase in other revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase of $11.5 million in mobile handset sales,
         which typically generate relatively low or no margins, associated with the October 2016 launch of a wholesale handset
         program, (ii) an increase in installation revenue and (iii) a decrease due to legislative developments that have reduced the
         fees Germany can charge late-paying customers.

_______________

(a)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is primarily attributable to
         declines in the average numbers of basic video RGUs and, to a much lesser extent, enhanced video RGUs in Switzerland
         that were mostly offset by increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony and broadband internet RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a net increase
         due to (a) higher ARPU from video and broadband internet services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services
         and (ii) a slight adverse change in RGU mix, as an adverse change in Austria was mostly offset by an improvement in
         Switzerland.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU primarily due to a decline of $1.6 million in mobile services revenue due to the September
         2015 introduction of a Split-contract Program in Switzerland.

(d)      The increase in other revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase of $7.5 million in mobile handset sales, which typically
         generate relatively low or no margins, including an increase of $1.7 million associated with the September 2015 introduction
         of a Split-contract Program in Switzerland, (ii) an increase in mobile interconnect revenue and (iii) a net decrease resulting
         from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription revenue categories.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is primarily attributable to
         the net effect of (i) increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs
         in Romania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, (ii) a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs in Hungary, Poland,
         Romania and Slovakia, (iii) increases in the average numbers of basic video and broadband internet RGUs in the Czech
         Republic, (iv) an increase in the average number of DTH RGUs and (v) declines in the average numbers of fixed-line
         telephony and enhanced video RGUs in the Czech Republic.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net decrease due to (a) lower
         ARPU from fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services and (b) higher ARPU from video services, primarily in
         Poland, and (ii) an adverse change in RGU mix, as adverse changes in Romania and the Czech Republic were largely offset
         by an improvement in Hungary.

    CWC. The increase in CWC’s revenue during 2016, as compared to 2015, is entirely attributable to the May 16, 2016 CWC
Acquisition. Accordingly, we do not separately discuss the changes in the revenue for the CWC segment. As further discussed
under Overview above, CWC is experiencing significant competition in all of its markets.

    Effective April 1, 2016, CWC began recognizing revenue on a cash, rather than accrual, basis with respect to two of its more
significant B2B customers due primarily to unfavorable collection experience and unfavorable macroeconomic factors. The
aggregate amount billed, but not recognized, with respect to these customers during the nine months ended December 31, 2016
was $11.0 million.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs that were only partially offset by declines in the
         average numbers of fixed-line telephony and basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due to (a) higher
         ARPU from video and broadband internet services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an
         improvement in RGU mix. In addition, the increase in Chile’s cable subscription revenue includes adjustments to reflect
         the retroactive application of a tariff on ancillary services provided directly to customers for the period from July 2013
         through February 2014, including (1) a decrease of $4.2 million due to the impact of unfavorable adjustments recorded
         during the first and second quarters of 2016 and (2) an increase of $2.2 million due to the impact of an unfavorable adjustment
         recorded during the first quarter of 2015.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to (i) an increase in the average number of mobile subscribers, as an
         increase in the average number of postpaid mobile subscribers more than offset the decrease in the average number of
         prepaid mobile subscribers, and (ii) higher ARPU primarily due to a higher proportion of mobile subscribers on postpaid
         plans, which generate higher ARPU than prepaid plans.

(d)      The decrease in other revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in advertising revenue and (ii) an increase
         of $2.7 million in interconnect revenue due to the impacts of unfavorable adjustments recorded during the first and third
         quarters of 2015 to reflect the retroactive application of a tariff reduction to June 2012.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs that were only partially offset by declines in
         (i) the average number of enhanced video RGUs and (ii) the average number of basic and multi-channel multi-point
         (microwave) distribution system video RGUs in Ireland.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a
         net increase primarily due to (a) higher ARPU from broadband internet services in the U.K., (b) lower ARPU from fixed-
         line telephony services and (c) higher ARPU from video services and (ii) an adverse change in RGU mix in Ireland. In
         addition, the growth in ARPU was partially offset by (1) the impact of a January 1, 2015 change in how VAT is applied to
         certain components of our U.K. operations, which reduced revenue by $49.9 million, and (2) a May 1, 2014 change in
         legislation in the U.K. with respect to the charging of VAT in connection with prompt payment discounts, as discussed
         below, which reduced revenue by $24.0 million.

(c)      The decrease in mobile subscription revenue relates to the U.K. and is due to (i) lower ARPU, including the net impact of
         (a) a decline of $41.6 million in postpaid mobile services revenue due to the November 2014 introduction of a Split-contract
         Program, (b) a decrease of $11.2 million related to the above-described January 1, 2015 change in how VAT is applied and
         (c) an increase in revenue due to the favorable impact of a $4.4 million adjustment to VAT recorded during the fourth quarter
         of 2015, and (ii) a decrease in the average number of subscribers, as a decrease in the average number of prepaid subscribers
         more than offset the increase in the average number of postpaid subscribers.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to (i) an increase in data revenue, primarily attributable to (a) higher volumes
         and (b) an increase of $22.7 million in the U.K.’s amortization of deferred upfront fees on B2B contracts, (ii) an increase
         in low-margin equipment sales in the U.K. and (iii) an increase in voice revenue, largely attributable to the net effect of (1)
         an $18.2 million increase recorded in the U.K. during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of disputes with
         mobile operators over amounts charged for voice traffic, including $16.3 million related to years prior to 2015, and (2) a
         decline in usage.

(e)      The increase in other revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales, primarily attributable
         to a $144.6 million increase associated with the November 2014 introduction of a Split-contract Program, (ii) a decrease
         in interconnect revenue of $23.4 million, primarily due to a decline in SMS termination volumes in the U.K., and (iii) a
         decrease in installation revenue of $12.6 million.

(f)      Represents the estimated impact of the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal. These non-cable subscribers were migrated to a third
         party during the first nine months of 2015.
                                                            II-24
    On March 19, 2014, the U.K. government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection
with prompt payment discounts such as those that Virgin Media offers to its fixed-line telephony customers. This change, which
took effect on May 1, 2014, impacted Virgin Media and some of its competitors. For additional information regarding a challenge
from the U.K. government regarding Virgin Media’s application of the prompt payment discount rules prior to the May 1, 2014
change in legislation, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

     Belgium. The decrease in Belgium’s revenue during 2015, as compared to 2014, includes (i) an organic increase of $138.7

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs that were only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) higher ARPU from broadband
         internet, video and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to higher revenue from (i) information technology security services and
         related equipment sales, (ii) data services and (iii) voice services.

(e)      The increase in other revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales of $11.6 million,
         (ii) an increase in interconnect revenue of $9.2 million, primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) growth in mobile call
         volumes and (b) lower SMS usage, and (iii) a decrease in set-top box sales of $7.4 million, primarily due to a digital cable
         migration completed during the third quarter of 2014. The increase in Belgium’s mobile handset sales, which typically
         generate relatively low margins, is primarily due to the net effect of (1) an increase of $12.5 million associated with the
         June 2015 introduction of a Split-contract Program, (2) a decrease in subsidized handset sales and (3) higher revenue from
         contract termination fees applicable to subsidized handsets.

     The Netherlands. The increase in the Netherlands’ revenue during 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily due to the Ziggo
Acquisition. Due to the size of the Ziggo Acquisition and the resulting impact on the organic growth rate of the Netherlands, the
below discussion and analysis of the Netherlands’ revenue is presented on a pro forma basis as if the results of Ziggo were included
along with those of Ziggo Services B.V. (Ziggo Services) for 2014. The pro forma revenue amount for Ziggo is based on Ziggo’s
publicly-reported results for 2014, as adjusted to (i) convert Ziggo’s publicly-reported results from International Financial Reporting
Standards, as adopted by the E.U., to U.S. GAAP, (ii) conform one of Ziggo’s accounting policies to the corresponding Liberty
Global accounting policy and (iii) reflect the impact of the acquisition accounting applied to the Ziggo Acquisition. We believe
this pro forma revenue analysis provides the most meaningful comparison of the Netherlands’ revenue.


                                                                                            II-25
    On a pro forma basis, the Netherlands’ revenue decreased $618.1 million or 18.4% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This
decrease includes (i) a pro forma organic decrease of $82.7 million or 2.5% and (ii) the impact of FX, as set forth below:

_______________

(a)      The pro forma decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to
         declines in the average numbers of basic video, enhanced video and fixed-line telephony RGUs that were only partially
         offset by an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs.

(b)      The pro forma decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a
         net decrease due to (a) lower ARPU from video and fixed-line telephony services and (b) higher ARPU from broadband
         internet services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The pro forma increase in mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers.

(d)      The pro forma decrease in other revenue is primarily due to (i) a decrease in revenue of $26.9 million resulting from the
         termination of a Ziggo partner network agreement shortly after the Ziggo Acquisition, (ii) a decrease in installation revenue
         and (iii) lower revenue from set-top box sales due to the fact that we stopped selling set-top boxes in the Netherlands during
         the first quarter of 2015.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that were only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) higher ARPU from broadband
         internet, video and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in B2B revenue is due to higher revenue from data and voice services.

(d)      The decrease in other revenue is primarily due to (i) a decrease from the unfavorable impact of $11.9 million of network
         usage revenue that Germany recorded during the first quarter of 2014 following the settlement of prior period amounts, (ii)
         a decrease in channel carriage fee revenue of $4.9 million and (iii) a decrease in interconnect revenue of $4.8 million.

     Switzerland/Austria. The decrease in Switzerland/Austria’s revenue during 2015, as compared to 2014, includes (i) an organic
increase of $52.3 million or 2.8%, (ii) the impact of an acquisition and (iii) the impact of FX, as set forth below:

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that were primarily offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to an increase in both Switzerland and Austria.
         The increase in ARPU in Switzerland is attributable to (i) an improvement in RGU mix and (ii) a net increase due to (a)
         higher ARPU from video services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services. The
         increase in ARPU in Austria is attributable to the net effect of (1) a net increase due to (I) higher ARPU from video and
         broadband internet services and (II) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (2) an adverse change in RGU
         mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of mobile subscribers
         in Switzerland. Switzerland’s mobile services were launched during the second quarter of 2014.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to a net increase in Switzerland from (i) higher revenue from voice and data
         services and (ii) lower revenue from construction services and equipment sales.

(e)      The increase in other revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales, which typically generate
         relatively low margins, (ii) a decrease in revenue from Austria’s non-cable subscriber base and (iii) a net increase resulting
         from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription revenue categories.

     Central and Eastern Europe. The decrease in Central and Eastern Europe’s revenue during 2015, as compared to 2014, includes
(i) an organic increase of $16.1 million or 1.3% and (ii) the impact of FX, as set forth below:

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to the net
         effect of (i) increases in the average numbers of enhanced video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs in
         Romania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, (ii) a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs in Poland, Hungary,
         Romania and Slovakia, (iii) an increase in the average number of DTH RGUs, (iv) declines in the average numbers of fixed-
         line telephony and enhanced video RGUs in the Czech Republic and (v) increases in the average numbers of basic video
         and broadband internet RGUs in the Czech Republic.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a net decrease
         due to (a) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services, (b) lower ARPU from broadband internet services, primarily in
         Poland, and (c) higher ARPU from video services, primarily in Poland and Romania, and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.
         In addition, the decline in ARPU includes the impact of a January 1, 2015 change in how VAT is calculated for UPC DTH’s
         operations in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which reduced UPC DTH’s revenue by $16.4 million.


                                                                                            II-28

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs that were only partially offset by declines in the
         average numbers of basic video and fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due to (a) higher
         ARPU from video and broadband internet services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an
         improvement in RGU mix. In addition, the growth in ARPU was partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the impact
         of a $2.5 million adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2015 to reflect the retroactive application of a proposed
         tariff on ancillary services provided directly to customers for the period from July 2013 through February 2014.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to (i) an increase in the average number of subscribers, as an increase
         in the average number of postpaid subscribers more than offset the decrease in the average number of prepaid subscribers,
         and (ii) higher ARPU, primarily due to a higher proportion of mobile subscribers on postpaid plans, which generate higher
         ARPU than prepaid plans.

(d)      The increase in other revenue is due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in interconnect revenue, (ii) an increase in installation
         revenue, (iii) an increase in advertising revenue and (iv) a net increase resulting from individually insignificant changes in
         other non-subscription revenue categories. The decrease in interconnect revenue is primarily due to (a) lower rates and (b)
         a decrease of $3.0 million related to the impact of adjustments recorded during the first and third quarters of 2015 to reflect
         the retroactive application of a tariff reduction to June 2012.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to increases
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily due to an adverse change in RGU mix.
         Excluding the impact of RGU mix, ARPU was relatively unchanged due to the net effect of (i) higher ARPU from video
         and broadband internet services and (ii) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services.

  Programming and Other Direct Costs of Services of our Reportable Segments

  Programming and other direct costs of services — 2016 compared to 2015

     General. Programming and other direct costs of services include programming and copyright costs, mobile access and
interconnect costs, mobile handset and other equipment cost of goods sold and other direct costs related to our operations.
Programming and copyright costs, which represent a significant portion of our operating costs, are expected to rise in future periods
as a result of (i) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary
product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, (ii) rate increases and (iii) growth in the number
of our enhanced video subscribers. In addition, we are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to certain costs and foreign
currency exchange risk with respect to costs and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional
currencies of our operating segments (non-functional currency expenses). Any cost increases that we are not able to pass on to
our subscribers through rate increases would result in increased pressure on our operating margins. For additional information
concerning our foreign currency exchange risks see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign
Currency Risk below.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

    European Division. The European Division’s programming and other direct costs of services increased $175.0 million or
4.7% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes (i) an increase of $241.1 million attributable to the impact of the
BASE Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $8.1 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable
Disposal and another less significant disposition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, the European Division’s
programming and other direct costs of services increased $192.1 million or 4.8%. This increase includes the following factors:

      •     An increase in programming and copyright costs of $207.5 million or 9.9%, primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland
            and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Belgium and Germany. These increases are primarily attributable to higher
            costs for certain premium and/or basic content, including increases of (i) $55.1 million associated with a sports
            programming contract entered into in August 2015 in U.K./Ireland and (ii) $19.2 million associated with a new Europe-
            wide programming contract that was entered into in June 2016 with retrospective impact to January 1, 2016. The increase
            in programming and copyright costs also includes the net effect of (a) an increase of $5.6 million in the Netherlands
            resulting from adjustments related to the settlement of operational contingencies recorded during the third and fourth
            quarters of 2015 and (b) a decrease of $3.5 million in U.K./Ireland associated with the reassessment of an accrual during
            the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, growth in the number of enhanced video subscribers contributed to the increases
            in Germany and Belgium;

      •     A decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs of $53.1 million or 4.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decline
            resulting from lower rates, primarily in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower fixed-line telephony call volumes in U.K./Ireland and, to
            a lesser extent, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, (iii) higher mobile usage in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent,
            Switzerland/Austria and Belgium, (iv) a $6.6 million decrease in Belgium due to the release of an accrual during the
            second quarter of 2016 as a result of the settlement of an operational contingency, (v) a decrease of $4.2 million in U.K./
            Ireland related to the settlement of disputes with mobile operators over amounts charged for voice traffic during the fourth
            quarter of 2015 and (vi) an increase of $3.9 million in Switzerland/Austria related to the settlement of an operational
            contingency during the third quarter of 2015; and

      •     An increase in mobile handset costs of $11.3 million, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher mobile handset sales
            volumes, as increases in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Germany and Switzerland/Austria were only partially offset
            by lower handset sales in Belgium and (ii) a lower average cost per handset sold in U.K./Ireland. The lower number of
            handsets sold in Belgium is primarily attributable to a reduction in subsidized handset promotions.

    LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s programming and other direct costs of services increased $340.3 million or 100.6%
during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes an increase of $337.9 million attributable to the impact of the CWC
Acquisition and the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the LiLAC Division’s programming and
other direct costs of services increased $10.3 million or 1.5%. This increase includes the following factors:

      •     An increase in programming and copyright costs of $10.9 million or 4.4%, primarily associated with the net effect of (i)
            growth in the number of enhanced video subscribers in Chile, (ii) decreased costs for certain premium content in Puerto
            Rico and (iii) an increase arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, after giving effect to derivative
            instruments that hedge the currency exposure associated with Chile’s U.S. dollar denominated programming contracts.
            A significant portion of Chile’s programming contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2016, CWC began
            broadcasting live Premier League games in a number of its markets pursuant to a new multi-year agreement. The cost of
            the rights to broadcast these games, which are excluded from the calculation of organic growth, will continue to result
            in significant increases to CWC’s programming costs;

      •     An increase in mobile handset costs of $3.7 million, primarily due to higher mobile handset sales in Chile; and

      •     A decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs of $1.7 million or 5.1%, primarily attributable to the net effect of (i)
            lower mobile access charges and, to a lesser extent, lower mobile usage in Chile and (ii) a $2.3 million increase in Chile
            related to an adjustment that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to reflect a February 2015 tariff decline that was
            retroactive to May 2014.

    European Division. The European Division’s programming and other direct costs of services increased $51.1 million or 1.4%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes (i) an increase of $342.4 million attributable to the impact of the Ziggo
Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $38.1 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions, the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and FX, the European Division’s programming and other direct
costs of services increased $209.0 million or 5.2%. This increase includes the following factors:

      •     An increase in programming and copyright costs of $193.7 million or 9.9%, primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland
            and, to a lesser extent, Belgium. The increased costs in (i) U.K./Ireland are primarily due to higher costs for certain
            premium and basic content, due in part to a new sports programming contract entered into in August 2015, and (ii) Belgium
            are primarily due to (a) higher costs for certain premium content and (b) growth in the number of enhanced video
            subscribers. The increase in programming and copyright costs also includes a $29.4 million net increase resulting from
            the impact of certain adjustments related to the settlement or reassessment of operational contingencies. The adjustments
            recorded during 2015 resulted in lower costs of $10.4 million, including a $6.5 million benefit in the Netherlands that
            we recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and a $3.9 million benefit in Germany that we recorded during
            the fourth quarter of 2015. The adjustments recorded during 2014 resulted in lower costs of $39.8 million, including (1)

                                                                                      II-33
         a $17.5 million benefit in Belgium and a $7.3 million benefit in Poland that we recorded during the first quarter of 2014
         and (2) an $11.6 million benefit in U.K./Ireland that we recorded during the second quarter of 2014;

    •    An increase in mobile handset costs of $42.1 million, largely due to the net impact of (i) an increase in the proportion of
         higher-value handsets sold in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent, increased mobile handset costs in Belgium, due in part
         to the impact of a Split-contract Program implemented in the U.K. in November 2014 and in Belgium in June 2015, (ii)
         a decrease in costs as a result of continued growth of subscriber identification module or “SIM”-only contracts in U.K./
         Ireland and (iii) a decrease in costs associated with the impact of subscriber promotions involving free or heavily-
         discounted handsets that were offered in Belgium during 2014; and

    •    An increase in mobile access and interconnect costs of $1.7 million or 0.1%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased
         costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Belgium, attributable to higher mobile usage and, in the case of Belgium, mobile
         subscriber growth, (ii) a decline resulting from lower rates, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Germany, (iii) lower fixed-line
         telephony call volumes, primarily related to the net impact of declines in U.K./Ireland and the Netherlands and increases
         in Switzerland/Austria, (iv) increased costs associated with B2B services in U.K./Ireland, (v) an increase of $4.4 million
         in U.K./Ireland related to the settlement of disputes with mobile operators over amounts charged for voice traffic during
         the fourth quarter of 2015 and (vi) a decrease of $4.2 million in Switzerland/Austria related to the settlement of an
         operational contingency during the third quarter of 2015.

    LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s programming and other direct costs of services increased $13.9 million or 4.3% during
2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes an increase of $14.5 million attributable to the impact of the Choice Acquisition.
Excluding the effects of this acquisition and FX, the LiLAC Division’s programming and other direct costs of services increased
$32.8 million or 9.7%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •    An increase in programming and copyright costs of $24.9 million or 10.7%, primarily associated with (i) increases in
         Chile and, to a lesser extent, Puerto Rico, due to growth in the numbers of enhanced video subscribers and, in the case
         of Puerto Rico, increased costs for certain content, and (ii) an increase of $5.6 million arising from foreign currency
         exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Chile’s U.S. dollar denominated programming contracts. A significant portion
         of Chile’s programming contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars; and

    •    An increase in mobile access and interconnect costs of $6.1 million or 8.1%, primarily attributable to the net effect of (i)
         an increase in Chile related to (a) higher roaming costs due to the impact of increased volumes and (b) higher interconnect
         costs resulting from the net effect of increased call volumes and lower rates, (ii) a decrease of $5.1 million in mobile
         access charges in Chile due to a February 2015 tariff decline that was retroactive to May 2014, including a decrease of
         $2.5 million related to 2014 access charges, and (iii) an increase in Puerto Rico related to additional capacity agreements
         with third-party internet providers.

  Other Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments

  Other operating expenses — 2016 compared to 2015

     General. Other operating expenses include network operations, customer operations, customer care, share-based compensation
and other costs related to our operations. We do not include share-based compensation in the following discussion and analysis
of the other operating expenses of our reportable segments as share-based compensation expense is not included in the performance
measures of our reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed under Discussion and Analysis of our
Consolidated Operating Results below. We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and certain other costs
and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to non-functional currency expenses. Any cost increases that we are not able to
pass on to our subscribers through rate increases would result in increased pressure on our operating margins. For additional
information concerning our foreign currency exchange risks see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk —
Foreign Currency Risk below.

     European Division. The European Division’s other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense)
decreased $29.6 million or 1.2% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This decrease includes (i) an increase of $109.6 million
attributable to the impact of the BASE Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $1.0 million
attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and another less significant disposition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions,
dispositions and FX, the European Division’s other operating expenses decreased $32.4 million or 1.3%. This decrease includes
the following factors:

      •     A decrease in personnel costs of $29.0 million or 3.2%, due primarily to the net effect of (i) decreased staffing levels, as
            decreases in U.K./Ireland, Switzerland/Austria and the Netherlands were only partially offset by increases in the European
            Division’s central operations and Belgium, (ii) annual wage increases, (iii) decreased costs in U.K./Ireland resulting from
            higher proportions of capitalized labor costs associated with the Network Extensions, (iv) lower costs related to certain
            employee benefits in U.K./Ireland and the European Division’s central operations and (v) lower incentive compensation
            costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland;

      •     An increase in network-related expenses of $15.5 million or 2.2%. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i)
            an $18.1 million increase resulting from retroactive adjustments recorded during the first and second quarters of 2015 to
            reflect lower local authority charges for certain elements of network infrastructure in the U.K., (ii) higher network
            maintenance costs, as increases in Belgium, U.K./Ireland, Hungary and Poland were only partially offset by decreases
            in the Netherlands and Switzerland/Austria, (iii) lower outsourced labor costs primarily associated with customer-facing
            activities in Germany and U.K./Ireland, (iv) a $6.2 million decrease in U.K./Ireland associated with the settlement of an
            operational contingency during the first quarter of 2016, (v) higher energy costs, as increases in Belgium, the Netherlands
            and Germany were only partially offset by lower costs in U.K./Ireland, (vi) a net decrease of $5.5 million in Germany
            associated with certain reassessments of an accrual during 2016 and 2015 and (vii) a decrease of $2.5 million as a result
            of costs incurred during the first half of 2015 associated with network harmonization activities following the Ziggo
            Acquisition. For information regarding increased charges for network infrastructure in the U.K. that are expected to
            become effective April 1, 2017, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements;

      •     A decrease in bad debt and collection expenses of $11.2 million or 8.3%, primarily related to declines in U.K./Ireland,
            the Netherlands, Hungary and Switzerland/Austria that were only partially offset by increases in Germany and Poland;

      •     An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $10.5 million or 2.9%, primarily due to (i) an increase in call
            center costs, as higher costs in U.K./Ireland were only partially offset by lower costs in Switzerland/Austria and the
            Netherlands and (ii) higher consulting costs, as increases in the European Division’s central operations, Switzerland/
            Austria and the Netherlands were only partially offset by decreases in Belgium and U.K./Ireland. The lower call center
            costs in the Netherlands are attributable to a decrease of $12.7 million associated with third-party costs related to network
            and product harmonization activities and certain other third-party customer care costs following the Ziggo Acquisition;

      •     An increase in information technology-related expenses of $9.0 million or 9.6%, as higher software and other information
            technology-related service and maintenance costs in the European Division’s central operations, Germany and the
            Netherlands were only partially offset by a decrease in U.K./Ireland;

      •     A decrease in facilities expenses of $7.5 million or 12.7%, primarily due to lower costs in U.K./Ireland and the Netherlands;

      •     A decrease in vehicle expenses of $4.8 million or 10.7%, primarily related to lower costs for company vehicles in U.K./
            Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland/Austria and Hungary due largely to fewer vehicles and the impact of the conversion
            of certain operating leases to capital leases; and

      •     A net decrease resulting from individually insignificant changes in other operating expense categories.

     During the fourth quarter of 2016, we settled certain pylon tax disputes between BASE and certain local authorities in Belgium.
In connection with this settlement, we reversed $8.1 million of the pylon tax provisions that BASE had recorded since we acquired
BASE in February 2016. The effect of the originally recorded provisions and the reversal is included in our acquisition effect for
BASE and accordingly does not impact the organic changes in Telenet's other operating expenses.

                                                                   II-36
     LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased
$253.7 million or 138.1% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes an increase of $255.8 million attributable to
the impact of the CWC Acquisition and the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the LiLAC Division’s
other operating expenses increased $2.9 million or 0.7%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •   An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $4.6 million or 14.1%, primarily due to higher call center costs
        in Chile;

    •   A decrease in personnel costs of $2.0 million or 10.7%, primarily due to (i) annual wage decreases in Chile and (ii) lower
        staffing levels in Puerto Rico;

    •   A decrease in bad debt and collection expenses of $1.2 million or 2.9%, predominantly in Puerto Rico;

    •   An increase in network-related expenses of $1.0 million or 2.1%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher energy costs
        in Chile and (ii) lower outsourced labor costs associated with customer-facing activities in Puerto Rico; and

    •   An increase resulting from individually insignificant changes in other operating expense categories.

     European Division. The European Division’s other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense)
decreased $111.1 million or 4.3% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes (i) an increase of $236.1 million
attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $3.6 million
attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and FX, the
European Division’s other operating expenses increased $0.7 million or 0.0%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •    An increase in information technology-related expenses of $29.1 million or 40.2%, primarily due to higher software and
         other information technology-related service and maintenance costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the European Division’s
         central operations and Belgium;

    •    A decrease in personnel costs of $17.6 million or 1.9%, due primarily to the net effect of (i) lower incentive compensation
         costs, predominantly in U.K./Ireland, (ii) increased staffing levels, primarily in the European Division’s central operations,
         (iii) decreased costs in U.K./Ireland due to higher capitalized labor costs associated with the Network Extensions, (iv)
         annual wage increases, largely in U.K./Ireland, and (v) lower costs related to certain employee benefits in the Netherlands;

    •    An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $15.8 million or 4.4%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher
         call center costs in the Netherlands and U.K./Ireland and (ii) lower consulting costs, as a decrease in the European
         Division’s central operations was only partially offset by increases in Belgium and the Netherlands. The higher call center
         costs in the Netherlands represent third-party costs that are primarily related to network and product harmonization
         activities following the Ziggo Acquisition that, together with certain other third-party customer care costs, accounted for
         an increase of $17.3 million; and

    •    A decrease in network-related expenses of $9.6 million or 1.2%. This decrease includes (i) lower outsourced labor costs
         associated with customer-facing activities in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower costs of $8.6 million in U.K./Ireland associated with
         the reassessment of accruals or operational contingencies in 2015, (iii) an increase in third-party costs incurred in the
         Netherlands of $2.8 million related to the harmonization of the Ziggo and Ziggo Services networks following the Ziggo
         Acquisition and (iv) a decrease in network maintenance costs, as decreases in U.K./Ireland and Switzerland/Austria were
         largely offset by increases in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The decrease in network-related expense also
         includes the impact of reductions in local authority charges for certain elements of network infrastructure in the U.K.
         arising from successful appeals during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. As compared to 2014, these reductions
         in local authority charges resulted in an increase in U.K./Ireland’s network-related expenses of $8.6 million.

     LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased
$4.6 million or 2.4% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes an increase of $8.9 million attributable to the
impact of the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of this acquisition and FX, the LiLAC Division’s other operating expenses
increased $5.0 million or 2.5%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •    A decrease in personnel costs of $7.1 million or 12.7%, largely due to (i) lower incentive compensation costs in Chile
         and (ii) decreased costs related to higher proportions of employees devoted to the development of new billing and customer
         care systems and other capitalizable activities in Chile;

    •    An increase in network-related expenses of $4.4 million or 10.3%, primarily due to an increase in network maintenance
         costs in Chile;

    •    An increase of $4.1 million due to the impact of favorable adjustments recorded in Chile during the fourth quarter of
         2014 related to the reassessment of certain accrued liabilities; and

    •    An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $3.2 million or 9.5%, primarily due to higher call center costs
         in Chile.

  SG&A Expenses of our Reportable Segments

  SG&A expenses — 2016 compared to 2015

     General. SG&A expenses include human resources, information technology, general services, management, finance, legal,
external sales and marketing costs, share-based compensation and other general expenses. We do not include share-based
compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the SG&A expenses of our reportable segments as share-based
compensation expense is not included in the performance measures of our reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense
is discussed under Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below. We are subject to inflationary pressures
with respect to our labor and certain other costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to non-functional currency
expenses. For additional information concerning our foreign currency exchange risks see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below.

    European Division. The European Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased
$99.0 million or 4.1% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes $152.7 million attributable to the impact of the
BASE Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the European Division’s
SG&A expenses increased $49.4 million or 1.9%. This increase includes the following factors:

      •     An increase in personnel costs of $49.6 million or 5.0%, primarily due to (i) increased staffing levels, as increases in
            U.K./Ireland, the European Division’s central operations, Germany and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland/Austria, were
            only partially offset by decreased staffing levels in the Netherlands and (ii) annual wage increases;

      •     A decrease in external sales and marketing costs of $15.1 million or 1.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower
            costs associated with advertising campaigns, as decreases in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland/Austria were
            only partially offset by higher costs in Belgium, (ii) higher third-party sales commissions, as increases in Germany and
            U.K./Ireland were only partially offset by a decline in the Netherlands, (iii) lower third-party costs in the Netherlands of
            $4.0 million related to the impact of rebranding costs incurred during the 2015 period following the Ziggo Acquisition
            and (iv) a net increase of $0.3 million in Germany, as the reassessments of accruals led to offsetting reductions of $3.7
            million and $4.0 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively;

      •     An increase in facilities expenses of $9.3 million or 4.6%, primarily due to higher rent and other facilities-related expenses
            in the European Division’s central operations, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and U.K./Ireland;

      •     An increase of $8.4 million due to the impact of an accrual release during the second quarter of 2015 related to the
            resolution of a contingency associated with universal service obligations in Belgium;

      •     A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of $5.2 million or 3.1%, due to the net effect of (i) increased legal
            costs in the European Division’s central operations and Belgium, (ii) a decrease in consulting costs, as decreases in the
            European Division’s central operations and U.K./Ireland were only partially offset by increases in Belgium and the
            Netherlands, and (iii) a net decrease resulting from other individually insignificant changes. The decrease in consulting

                                                                                  II-41
        costs includes (a) a decrease of $4.8 million associated with integration costs incurred in connection with the Ziggo
        Acquisition, (b) a $3.5 million decrease in integration costs in Belgium as the costs incurred in 2015 to prepare for the
        integration of BASE into Telenet’s operations exceeded the integration costs incurred in 2016 and (c) a decrease of $2.6
        million in U.K./Ireland associated with consulting fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection with the
        settlement of disputes with mobile operators over amounts charged for voice traffic;

    •   An increase in outsourced call center expenses of $5.1 million of 12.3%, primarily due to increases in the Netherlands
        and U.K./Ireland; and

    •   An increase in information technology-related expenses of $2.6 million or 2.4%, primarily due to higher software and
        other information technology-related maintenance costs in the European Division’s central operations and Belgium that
        were only partially offset by a decrease in these costs in the Netherlands.

     LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased $316.1
million or 158.0% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes an increase of $321.3 million attributable to the
impact of the CWC Acquisition and the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the LiLAC Division’s
SG&A expenses decreased $0.3 million or 0.0%. This decrease includes the following factors:

    •   A $12.6 million decrease associated with the effective settlement of the PRTC Claim including (i) a $5.1 million reduction
        that represents the net impact of the reversal of the provision and related indemnification asset associated with the PRTC
        Claim that were originally recorded in connection with the OneLink Acquisition and (ii) the receipt of $7.5 million of
        indemnification proceeds from the former owners of OneLink. For additional information, see note 17 to our consolidated
        financial statements;

    •   An increase of $9.9 million associated with integration costs incurred during 2016 to integrate Columbus (acquired by
        CWC on March 31, 2015) with CWC’s operations and CWC’s operations with Liberty Global and the LiLAC Division.
        These costs are excluded from the Acquisition Impact for CWC and, accordingly, are included in the calculation of organic
        growth;

    •   An increase in personnel costs of $2.3 million or 3.5%, primarily in Chile, as increases in staffing levels and higher
        incentive compensation costs were only partially offset by lower severance costs; and

    •   A decrease in facilities expenses of $2.2 million or 6.2%, primarily due to lower facilities maintenance and utility costs
        in Chile.

(a)       General and administrative expenses include all personnel-related costs within our SG&A expenses, including personnel-
          related costs associated with our sales and marketing function.

    European Division. The European Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased
$39.3 million or 1.6% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes $286.7 million attributable to the impact of the
Ziggo Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the European Division’s
SG&A expenses increased $24.7 million or 0.9%. This increase includes the following factors:

      •     An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $22.4 million or 13.5%, primarily due to the net effect of (i)
            increased consulting costs associated with (a) strategic initiatives in U.K./Ireland and (b) scale initiatives in the areas of
            information technology and finance in the European Division’s central operations, (ii) the positive impact of a $7.8 million
            increase associated with consulting fees incurred during the third quarter of 2014 in connection with the reduction in
            local authority charges for certain elements of network infrastructure in the U.K., as discussed under Other Operating
            Expenses of our Reportable Segments above, (iii) increased consulting costs related to integration activities in (1) Belgium
            of $9.0 million and (2) the Netherlands and the European Division’s central operations of $1.6 million, (iv) decreased
            consulting costs related to strategic initiatives in Germany, (v) decreased legal costs in U.K./Ireland and (vi) an increase
            of $2.7 million in U.K./Ireland associated with consulting fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection
            with the settlement of disputes with mobile operators over amounts charged for voice traffic;

      •     An increase in personnel costs of $16.9 million or 1.7%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased staffing levels,
            primarily in the European Division’s central operations, Germany and U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower incentive compensation
            costs, as decreases in U.K./Ireland and the Netherlands were only partially offset by an increase in Belgium, (iii) annual
            wage increases, largely in U.K./Ireland, (iv) lower costs related to certain employee benefits in the Netherlands, (v)
            decreased costs in U.K./Ireland due to higher capitalized labor costs associated with the Network Extensions, (vi) a $3.2
            million increase in the European Division’s central operations due to the impact of an accrual release recorded in the
            fourth quarter of 2014 associated with the settlement of an operational contingency and (vii) higher temporary personnel
            costs in the Netherlands of $2.0 million related to integration activities in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition;

      •     A decrease of $10.4 million due to an accrual release recorded during the second quarter of 2015 related to the resolution
            of a contingency associated with universal service obligations in Belgium;

      •     A decrease in external sales and marketing costs of $9.2 million or 1.1%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher
            third-party sales commissions, as an increase in Germany was only partially offset by a decline in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower
            costs associated with advertising campaigns, as decreases in the Netherlands, Germany and U.K./Ireland were only
            partially offset by an increase in Belgium, (iii) a decrease of $4.7 million in Germany due to the impact of accrual releases

                                                                                  II-44
        in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 associated with the reassessment of an accrual and (iv) a $3.8 million increase in
        third-party costs in the Netherlands and the European Division’s central operations related to rebranding activities
        following the Ziggo Acquisition; and

    •   A decrease in information technology-related expenses of $1.6 million or 1.5%, primarily due to lower software and
        information technology-related maintenance costs, as decreases in Germany and U.K./Ireland were only partially offset
        higher costs in the European Division’s central operations.

     LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased $12.0
million or 5.7%, during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes an increase of $7.8 million attributable to the impact
of the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of this acquisition and FX, the LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses increased
$3.0 million or 1.4%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •   An increase in external sales and marketing costs of $4.4 million or 7.4%, primarily due to higher third-party sales
        commissions in Chile;

    •   A decrease of $2.2 million, due to lower costs associated with the national gross receipts tax that was implemented in
        Puerto Rico in July 2014. In 2015, it was determined that the tax would not be continued beyond 2014;

    •   An increase in facilities expenses of $2.0 million or 7.7%, primarily due to higher rental and utility costs in Chile;

    •   A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of $1.8 million or 13.5%, primarily due to lower fees associated
        with legal proceedings in Puerto Rico;

    •   An increase of $1.6 million due to the impact of favorable adjustments that were recorded in Chile during the fourth
        quarter of 2014 related to the reassessment of certain accrued liabilities;

    •   A decrease in personnel costs of $1.3 million or 1.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in Chile due to
        lower incentive compensation and severance costs and (ii) annual wage increases; and

    •   A net increase resulting from individually insignificant changes in other SG&A expense categories.

     In addition to organic changes in the revenue, programming and other direct costs of services, other operating expenses and
SG&A expenses of our reportable segments, the Adjusted OIBDA margins presented above include the impact of acquisitions,
the most significant of which are the CWC Acquisition, the BASE Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and the Ziggo Acquisition.
In this regard, the Adjusted OIBDA margin of Belgium during 2016 was adversely impacted by the inclusion of BASE, while the
2016 Adjusted OIBDA margin of Puerto Rico was positively impacted by the realized synergies with respect to the Choice
Acquisition. During 2015, as compared to 2014, the Adjusted OIBDA margins of the Netherlands and Puerto Rico were adversely
impacted by the inclusion of Ziggo and Choice, respectively, each of which generated relatively lower Adjusted OIBDA margins
than the respective legacy operations. For discussion of the factors contributing to other changes in the Adjusted OIBDA margins
of our reportable segments, see the above analyses of the revenue and expenses of our reportable segments.

_______________

(a)     Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
        fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(b)     Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $313.4 million and $212.7 million during 2016 and
        2015, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue.

(c)     B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium
        to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain SOHO subscribers.
        SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-
        line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
        subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in subscription revenue, aggregated $491.8 million and
        $319.2 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. On an organic basis, our total B2B revenue, including revenue from
        SOHO subscribers, increased 5.4% during 2016, as compared to 2015. A portion of the increase in our SOHO revenue is
        attributable to the conversion of our residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers.

(d)     Other revenue includes, among other items, interconnect fees, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fees and installation
        fees.

     Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $1,728.8 million during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes
(i) an increase of $2,117.4 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $29.5 million attributable to the
impact of dispositions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our consolidated revenue increased $527.6
million or 2.6%.

Increase in cable subscription revenue due to change in:
   Average number of RGUs.................................................................................................................................... $                    266.9
   ARPU...................................................................................................................................................................         129.3
     Total increase in cable subscription revenue ....................................................................................................                             396.2
Decrease in mobile subscription revenue .................................................................................................................                          (20.9)
     Total organic increase in subscription revenue.................................................................................................                                375.3
Impact of acquisitions...............................................................................................................................................             1,109.3
Impact of a disposal ..................................................................................................................................................             (11.8)
Impact of FX.............................................................................................................................................................          (712.1)
     Total .................................................................................................................................................................. $    760.7

     Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased $396.2
million or 2.7% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is due to the net effect of (i) an increase from broadband internet
services of $345.9 million or 6.6%, attributable to an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs and higher
ARPU from broadband internet services, (ii) an increase from video services of $103.7 million or 1.6%, attributable to the net
effect of (a) higher ARPU from video services and (b) a decline in the average number of video RGUs, and (iii) a decrease from
fixed-line telephony services of $53.4 million or 1.6%, attributable to the net effect of (1) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony
services and (2) an increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs.

    Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated mobile subscription revenue decreased $20.9 million or 1.2%
during 2016, as compared to 2015. This decrease is largely due to the net effect of (i) a decline in the U.K., largely associated with
the U.K. Split-contract Program, and (ii) increases in Belgium, Switzerland and Chile.

    B2B revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated B2B revenue increased $39.8 million or 1.8%
during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is largely due to increases in the U.K. and Belgium.

     Other revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our consolidated other revenue increased $112.5
million or 8.2% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in mobile handset sales,
mainly associated with Split-contract Programs, primarily in the U.K.

of our Reportable Segments — Revenue — 2016 compared to 2015 above. For information regarding the competitive environment

  Programming and other direct costs of services

     Our programming and other direct costs of services increased $502.2 million during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase
includes (i) an increase of $579.0 million attributable to the impact of the CWC Acquisition, the BASE Acquisition, the Choice
Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $21.6 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal
and other less significant dispositions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our programming and other
direct costs of services increased $203.5 million or 4.4% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is primarily attributable
to the net effect of (a) an increase in programming and copyright costs, (b) a decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs and
(c) an increase in mobile handset costs. For additional information regarding the changes in our programming and other direct
costs of services, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Programming and Other Direct Costs of Services
of our Reportable Segments above.

  Other operating expenses

     Our other operating expenses increased $229.6 million during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes (i) an increase
of $365.6 million attributable to the impact of the CWC Acquisition, the BASE Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other less
significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $2.2 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and other less significant
dispositions. Our other operating expenses include share-based compensation expense, which increased $1.3 million during 2016.
For additional information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of
acquisitions, dispositions, FX and share-based compensation expense, our other operating expenses decreased $25.7 million or
0.9% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) a decrease in personnel
costs, (b) an increase in network-related expenses, (c) an increase in outsourced labor and professional fees, (d) an increase in
information technology-related costs and (e) a decrease in bad debt and collection expenses. Certain of these changes include an
aggregate decrease in integration-related costs in the Netherlands of $15.2 million. For additional information regarding the changes
in our operating expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Other Operating Expenses of our Reportable
Segments above.

  SG&A expenses

     Our SG&A expenses increased $395.2 million during 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase includes $474.0 million
attributable to the impact of the CWC Acquisition, the BASE Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other less significant
acquisitions. Our SG&A expenses include share-based compensation expense, which decreased $22.6 million during 2016. For
additional information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions,
FX and share-based compensation expense, our SG&A expenses increased $57.4 million or 1.7% during 2016, as compared to
2015. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in personnel costs, (ii) a decrease in external sales and
marketing costs, (iii) an increase in outsourced labor and professional fees, (iv) an increase in outsourced call center costs and (v)
an increase in facilities expenses. Certain of these changes include (a) an aggregate decrease in integration-related costs in the
Netherlands of $10.9 million, (b) an aggregate decrease in integration-related costs in Belgium of $3.7 million and (c) an aggregate
increase in integration-related costs related to CWC of $13.3 million, including $9.9 million incurred by CWC in connection with
the integration of Columbus with CWC’s operations and CWC’s operations with Liberty Global and the LiLAC Division. For
additional information regarding the changes in our SG&A expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments —

         and described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements) in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive
         plans. As a result of the 2015 Award Modifications, we recognized $16.1 million and $69.3 million of incremental expense

     Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense increased $277.3 million or 4.8% during 2016, as compared
to 2015. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase associated with property and equipment additions related
to the installation of customer premises equipment, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives, (ii) a
decrease associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands and, to a lesser
extent, Chile, Switzerland/Austria, Belgium and Germany, (iii) an increase associated with acquisitions, primarily as a result of

  Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net

     The details of our impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                            Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                                                                              2016             2015
                                                                                                                                                                   in millions

LiLAC Group.....................................................................................................................................                 153.8            19.8
   Total............................................................................................................................................... $        348.5      $    174.1

     The total for 2016 includes (i) direct acquisition costs of $164.0 million, primarily related to the CWC Acquisition and, to a
lesser extent, the Dutch JV Transaction and the BASE Acquisition, and (ii) restructuring charges of $189.1 million, including (a)
$144.4 million of employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in Germany,
U.K./Ireland, the European Division’s central operations, Chile and the Netherlands, and (b) $41.3 million of contract termination
and other costs related to (1) contract termination charges, primarily in the European Division’s central operations, the corporate
and other category and Chile, and (2) the write-off of a prepaid indefeasible right of use for telecommunications capacity by Liberty
Puerto Rico due to the abandonment of this capacity in favor of capacity on CWC’s network. The direct acquisition costs incurred
during 2016 include transfer and stamp taxes as well as investment banking and other advisory fees.

     Based on the results of our October 1, 2016 goodwill impairment test, a hypothetical decline of 20% or more in the fair value
of any of CWC’s reporting units could result in the need to record a goodwill impairment charge. At December 31, 2016, the
aggregate goodwill associated with the CWC reporting units was $5.5 billion. If, among other factors, (i) the equity values of the
LiLAC Group were to remain depressed or decline further or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or
other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods
that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived
assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

      The total for 2015 includes (i) restructuring charges of $103.8 million, including (a) $102.3 million of employee severance
and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in the Netherlands, U.K./Ireland, Germany, Switzerland/
Austria and Puerto Rico, (b) contract termination charges of $19.3 million, primarily in Belgium, Chile and Puerto Rico, and (c)
a credit of $17.0 million recorded by Telenet during the fourth quarter following the settlement of its DTT capacity contract
obligations, the fair value of which were originally recorded during 2014 when Telenet discontinued the provision of DTT services,
(ii) direct acquisition costs of $49.8 million, primarily related to our acquisition of CWC, Telenet’s acquisition of BASE, our
acquisition of additional shares of ITV, the Choice Acquisition and the Ziggo Acquisition, (iii) impairment charges of $24.8 million,
                                                                  II-54
primarily in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland/Austria, and (iv) a $23.1 million loss on the divestiture of our Film1
channels.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     Excluding the effects of FX, interest expense increased $145.6 million or 6.0% during 2016, as compared to 2015. This
increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) higher average outstanding debt balances, largely due to debt incurred in
connection with the CWC Acquisition, the BASE Acquisition and debt issued by Ziggo Group Holding in advance of the closing
of the Dutch JV Transaction and (ii) lower weighted average interest rates related to the completion of certain financing transactions
that resulted in extended maturities and decreases to certain of our interest rates. For additional information regarding our
outstanding indebtedness, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

     It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing
indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements and under Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk below, we use derivative
instruments to manage our interest rate risks.

  Income tax benefit (expense)

     The details of our income tax benefit (expense) are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                            Year ended December 31,

Liberty Global Group......................................................................................................................... $                1,347.0 $      (324.3)
LiLAC Group.....................................................................................................................................                (129.1)        (40.6)
   Total............................................................................................................................................... $      1,217.9   $    (364.9)

      The income tax benefit during 2016 differs from the expected income tax expense of $109.9 million (based on the U.K.
statutory income tax rate of 20.0%), primarily due to the net positive impact of (i) a decrease in valuation allowances, including
tax benefits of $1.1 billion recognized in the Netherlands upon the release of valuation allowances in the fourth quarter of 2016,
(ii) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, (iii) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results,
(iv) the tax effect of intercompany financing and (v) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different
than the U.K. statutory income tax rate. The release of valuation allowances in the Netherlands is attributable to a significant
improvement in our forecast of taxable income in the Netherlands, due to, among other factors, the impacts of contributing Ziggo
Group Holding to the Dutch JV on December 31, 2016, as further described in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
The net positive impact of these items was partially offset by the net negative impact of (a) certain permanent differences between
the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items and (b) a reduction in net deferred tax assets in the U.K. and
other countries due to enacted changes in tax law.

     The income tax expense during 2015 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $136.9 million (based on the U.K.
statutory income tax rate of 20.0%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) a
reduction in net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to enacted changes in tax law and (iii) certain permanent differences between
the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. The net negative
impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) the tax effect of intercompany financing and (b) statutory
tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate.

   Total............................................................................................................................................... $       1,767.3    $       (1,049.5)

    Our earnings (loss) from continuing operations consists of (i) operating income of $2,801.3 million and $2,349.2 million,
respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of $2,251.9 million and $3,033.8 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax benefit
(expense) of $1,217.9 million and ($364.9 million), respectively.

    Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in foreign currency
exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such,
any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from
these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings from continuing operations is largely dependent
on our ability to increase our aggregate Adjusted OIBDA to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) share-
based compensation expense, (b) depreciation and amortization, (c) impairment, restructuring and other operating items, (d) interest
expense, (e) other non-operating expenses and (f) income tax expenses.

     Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization below, we expect that we will continue to report significant levels of interest
expense for the foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect certain
aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under Overview above. For information concerning the reasons
for changes in specific line items in our consolidated statements of operations, see the discussion under Discussion and Analysis
of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results above.

     The decrease in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily attributable
to the results of operations of (i) Telenet, (ii) certain CWC subsidiaries following the CWC Acquisition and (iii) Liberty Puerto
Rico.

_________________

(a)     Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
        fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(b)     Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $212.7 million and $245.0 million during 2015 and
        2014, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue.

(c)     B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium
        to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain SOHO subscribers.
        SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-
        line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
        subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in subscription revenue, aggregated $319.2 million and
        $216.5 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. On an organic basis, our total B2B revenue, including revenue from
        SOHO subscribers, increased 10.7% during 2015, as compared to 2014. A portion of the increase in our SOHO revenue is
        attributable to the conversion of our residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers.

(d)     Other revenue includes, among other items, interconnect, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fee and installation revenue.

     Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $31.7 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes
(i) an increase of $1,879.4 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $63.2 million attributable to the
U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and another less significant disposition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our
consolidated revenue increased $658.5 million or 3.3%.

     Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased $442.7 million or 2.7%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is due to the net effect of (i) an increase from broadband internet services of
$441.2 million or 8.3%, attributable to an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs and higher ARPU from
broadband internet services, (ii) an increase from video services of $27.4 million or 0.4%, attributable to the net effect of (a) higher
ARPU from video services and (b) a decline in the average number of video RGUs, and (iii) a decrease from fixed-line telephony
services of $25.9 million or 0.7%, attributable to the net effect of (1) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (2) an
increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs.

    Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated mobile subscription revenue increased $39.5 million or 3.6%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in Belgium, Chile, Switzerland
and the Netherlands and (ii) a decline in the U.K.

    B2B revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated B2B revenue increased $101.4 million or 6.2%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in the U.K., Switzerland, Belgium,
Germany and Poland and (ii) a decrease in the Netherlands.

     Other revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our consolidated other revenue increased $74.9
million or 6.7% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in
mobile handset sales, primarily associated with the introduction of Split-contract Programs in the U.K. and Belgium, (ii) a decrease
in fixed-line interconnect revenue, primarily in Chile, Germany and the U.K., (iii) a decrease in installation revenue, primarily in
the U.K. and the Netherlands, and (iv) a decrease in set-top box sales, primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands.

  Programming and other direct costs of services

     Our programming and other direct costs of services increased $60.9 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase
includes (i) an increase of $356.9 million attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other
less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $50.5 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and another less
significant disposition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our programming and other direct costs of
services increased $254.2 million or 5.8% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to increases
in (a) programming and copyright costs, (b) mobile handset costs and (c) mobile access and interconnect costs. For additional
information regarding the changes in our programming and other direct costs of services, see Discussion and Analysis of our
Reportable Segments — Programming and Other Direct Costs of Services of our Reportable Segments above.

  Other operating expenses

     Our other operating expenses decreased $120.6 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes (i) an
increase of $245.0 million attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other less significant
acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $4.8 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and another less significant disposition.
Our other operating expenses include share-based compensation expense, which decreased $4.2 million during 2015 as compared
to 2014. For additional information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of
acquisitions, dispositions, FX and share-based compensation expense, our other operating expenses increased $7.0 million or 0.2%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) an increase in information
technology-related costs, (b) a decrease in personnel costs, (c) an increase in outsourced labor and professional fees and (d) a
decrease in network-related expenses. Certain of these changes include the impact of a $20.1 million increase in integration-related
costs in the Netherlands. For additional information regarding the changes in our other operating expenses, see Discussion and
Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Other Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments above.

  SG&A expenses

     Our SG&A expenses increased $7.4 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes $294.5 million
attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions. Our SG&A
expenses include share-based compensation expense, which increased $65.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014. For
additional information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions,
FX and share-based compensation expense, our SG&A expenses increased $33.7 million or 1.1% during 2015, as compared to
2014. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in outsourced labor and professional fees, including an
increase in corporate costs of $19.9 million associated with the Liberty 3.0 initiative, (ii) an increase in personnel costs, (iii) a
decrease in external sales and marketing costs and (iv) a decrease in information technology-related expenses. Certain of these
changes include the impact of a $9.6 million increase in integration-related costs, primarily in the Netherlands and Belgium. For
additional information regarding the changes in our SG&A expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments —
SG&A Expenses of our Reportable Segments above.

     Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense increased $1,117.8 million or 20.3% during 2015, as
compared to 2014. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition. In addition, a net increase resulted from
(i) an increase associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the
expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives and (ii) a decrease associated with certain assets becoming
fully depreciated, primarily in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Chile and Switzerland/
Austria.

     Excluding the effects of FX, interest expense increased $228.5 million or 9.0% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This
increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) higher average outstanding debt balances, largely due to debt incurred in
connection with the Ziggo Acquisition, and (ii) lower weighted average interest rates related to the completion of certain financing
transactions that resulted in extended maturities and net decreases to certain of our interest rates. For additional information
regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

     The income tax expense during 2015 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $136.9 million (based on the U.K.
statutory income tax rate of 20.0%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) a
reduction in net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to enacted changes in tax law and (iii) certain permanent differences between
the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. The net negative
impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) the tax effect of intercompany financing and (b) statutory
tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate.

     The income tax benefit during 2014 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $221.7 million (based on the U.K. statutory
income tax rate of 21.0%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) certain permanent
differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items and (iii) certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries. The net negative impact
of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate
that are different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate, (b) the tax effect of intercompany financing, (c) non-deductible or non-
taxable foreign currency exchange results and (d) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.

   Total............................................................................................................................................... $       (1,049.5) $         (980.9)

    Our earnings (loss) from continuing operations consists of (i) operating income of $2,349.2 million and $2,228.2 million,
respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of $3,033.8 million and $3,284.1 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax benefit
(expense) of ($364.9 million) and $75.0 million, respectively.

  Discontinued operation

     Our earnings from discontinued operation, net of taxes, of $0.8 million during 2014 relate to the operations of the Chellomedia
Disposal Group. In addition, we recognized an after-tax gain on the disposal of a discontinued operation of $332.7 million related
to the January 31, 2014 completion of the Chellomedia Transaction. For additional information, see note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements.

     The increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily attributable
to the results of operations of Telenet.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Sources and Uses of Cash

     We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements
at the corporate level. Each of our significant operating subsidiaries is included within one of our seven primary subsidiary
“borrowing groups.” These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within Virgin Media,
Unitymedia, UPC Holding, Telenet, CWC, VTR Finance and Liberty Puerto Rico. Our borrowing groups, which typically generate
cash from operating activities, accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
2016. The terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowing groups may restrict our ability to access the
liquidity of these subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax
and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests, foreign currency exchange restrictions with respect to certain
CWC subsidiaries and other factors.

  Cash and cash equivalents

     The details of the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 are
set forth in the following table (in millions):
Cash and cash equivalents held by:

_______________

(a)     Represents the amount held by Liberty Global on a standalone basis, which is attributed to the Liberty Global Group.

(b)     Represents the aggregate amount held by subsidiaries attributed to the Liberty Global Group that are outside of our borrowing
        groups.

(c)     The Virgin Media borrowing group includes certain subsidiaries of Virgin Media, but excludes Virgin Media. The $0.2
        million of cash and cash equivalents held by Virgin Media is included in the amount shown for the Liberty Global Group’s
        unrestricted subsidiaries.

(d)     Represents the aggregate amount held by subsidiaries attributed to the LiLAC Group that are outside of our borrowing
        groups.


                                                                                          II-71
(e)    Except as otherwise noted, represents the aggregate amounts held by the parent entity and restricted subsidiaries of our
       borrowing groups.

(f)    CWC's subsidiaries hold substantially all of CWC's consolidated cash. The ability of certain of these subsidiaries to loan
       or distribute their cash to CWC is limited by foreign exchange restrictions, the existence of noncontrolling interests, tax
       considerations and restrictions contained within the debt agreements of certain CWC subsidiaries. As a result, a significant
       portion of the cash held by CWC subsidiaries is not considered to be an immediate source of corporate liquidity for CWC.

  Liquidity of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries

     The $58.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations,
the $932.8 million of aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by the unrestricted subsidiaries attributed to the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group, represented available liquidity at the corporate level at December 31, 2016. Our remaining cash
and cash equivalents of $637.5 million at December 31, 2016 were held by our borrowing groups as set forth in the table above.
As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the cash of our borrowing groups. For information regarding certain
limitations imposed by our subsidiaries’ debt instruments at December 31, 2016, see note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements.

     Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain
tax and legal considerations, Liberty Global’s unrestricted subsidiaries, and (ii) interest and dividend income received on our and,
subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries’ cash and cash equivalents and investments. In addition,
our parent entity’s short-term liquidity is supplemented by interest payments that it receives on a note receivable from one of our
unrestricted subsidiaries (outstanding principal of $9.6 billion at December 31, 2016, all outstanding principal due in 2021).

     From time to time, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of distributions
or loan repayments from Liberty Global’s borrowing groups or affiliates (including amounts from the Dutch JV beginning in 2017)
upon (a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings, asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation
of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of Liberty Global
and its unrestricted subsidiaries and (iii) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt by Liberty Global or its unrestricted
subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by Liberty Global, including equity securities issued to satisfy subsidiary obligations.
No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries on
favorable terms, or at all. On January 4, 2017, in connection with the completion of the Dutch JV Transaction, our company
received cash of €2.2 billion ($2.3 billion at the transaction date). For additional information, see note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements.

     The amount of cash we receive from our subsidiaries to satisfy U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements is impacted
by fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly with regard to the translation of British pounds sterling and euros into U.S. dollars.
In this regard, the strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar against these currencies will result in decreases (increases) in the
U.S. dollars received from the applicable subsidiaries to fund the repurchase of our equity securities and other U.S. dollar-
denominated liquidity requirements. The U.S. dollar has significantly strengthened against the British pound sterling during the
period following Brexit.

     At December 31, 2016, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance includes $1,548.1 million held by entities that are
domiciled outside of the U.K. Based on our assessment of our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient
basis and our expectations with respect to our corporate liquidity requirements, we do not anticipate that tax considerations will
adversely impact our corporate liquidity over the next 12 months. Our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax
efficient basis is a consideration in assessing the extent of our share repurchase programs.

     Our corporate liquidity requirements include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses, (ii) interest payments on the
Sumitomo Collar Loan and Sumitomo Share Loan and (iii) principal payments on the ITV Collar Loan, the Sumitomo Collar
Loan, the Sumitomo Share Loan and the Lionsgate Loan to the extent not settled through the delivery of the underlying shares.
Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also require cash in connection with (a) the repayment of third-party and
intercompany debt, (b) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (c) acquisitions, (d) the repurchase of equity and debt securities,
(e) other investment opportunities or (f) income tax payments. In addition, our parent entity uses available liquidity to make interest
and principal payments on notes payable to certain of our unrestricted subsidiaries (aggregate outstanding principal of $5,764.6
million at December 31, 2016 and no stated maturity). For information regarding our commitments and contingencies, see note
17 to our consolidated financial statements.


                                                                  II-72
     As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our “Distributable
Reserves.” Distributable Reserves, which are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount, may be created through the earnings
of the U.K. parent company and, among other methods, through a reduction in share premium approved by the English Companies
Court. Based on the amounts set forth in our 2015 U.K. Companies Act Report dated April 25, 2016, which are our most recent
“Relevant Accounts” for the purposes of determining our Distributable Reserves under U.K. law, our Distributable Reserves were
$27.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. This amount does not reflect earnings, share repurchases or other activity that occurred in
2016, each of which impacts the amount of our Distributable Reserves.

     During 2016, we repurchased Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2,068.0 million
and $21.5 million, respectively, including direct acquisition costs and the effects of derivative instruments. At December 31, 2016,
the remaining amount authorized for repurchases of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares was $1,943.4 million and $278.6
million, respectively. Purchases of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares will be funded by the respective liquidity of the
Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our board of directors increased the amount
authorized under the share repurchase program for our Liberty Global Shares by $1.0 billion. For additional information regarding
our share repurchase programs, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Liquidity of borrowing groups

     The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents,
the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their
respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of such entities at December 31, 2016, see note 10 to our
consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by contributions
and/or loans from Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries. The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally is used to fund
property and equipment additions, debt service requirements and income tax payments. From time to time, our borrowing groups
may also require liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to Liberty Global, (iii)
capital distributions to Liberty Global and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities. No assurance can
be given that any external funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. For information
regarding our borrowing groups’ commitments and contingencies, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

    For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows below.

  Capitalization

     We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard,
we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance
(excluding the ITV Collar Loan, Sumitomo Collar Loan, the Sumitomo Share Loan and the Lionsgate Loan and measured using
subsidiary debt figures at swapped foreign currency exchange rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our
subsidiary debt agreements) that is between four and five times our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA, although it should be noted
that the timing of our acquisitions and financing transactions and the interplay of average and spot foreign currency rates may
impact this ratio. The ratio of our December 31, 2016 consolidated debt to our annualized consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the
quarter ended December 31, 2016 was 4.8x. In addition, the ratio of our December 31, 2016 consolidated net debt (debt, as defined
above, less cash and cash equivalents) to our annualized consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2016
was 4.6x. As adjusted for the cash we received on January 4, 2017 in connection with the completion of the Dutch JV Transaction,
our consolidated net debt to our annualized consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 would be
4.3x. The leverage ratios provided in this paragraph exclude the Adjusted OIBDA of Ziggo Group Holding, as our December 31,
2016 consolidated debt does not include the debt associated with this entity. For information on the formation of the Dutch JV,
see note 5.

    When it is cost effective, we generally seek to match the denomination of the borrowings of our subsidiaries with the functional
currency of the operations that support the respective borrowings. As further discussed under Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk below and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, we also use derivative instruments
to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments.

     Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements
and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted OIBDA of our
operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our
ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our
borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted OIBDA of UPC Broadband Holding were to decline, we could be required to
                                                                II-73
partially repay or limit our borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with
applicable covenants. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources of liquidity, or that any external funding
would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such required repayment. At December 31, 2016, each of our borrowing
groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance with respect
to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12
months.

     At December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our capital lease obligations,
aggregated $43.6 billion, including $2,775.1 million that is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet and $38.5 billion
that is not due until 2021 or thereafter. For additional information concerning our debt maturities, see note 10 to our consolidated
financial statements.

     Notwithstanding our negative working capital position at December 31, 2016, we believe that we have sufficient resources
to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements
during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance
or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions
or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign
debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our
future liquidity and financial position. Our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely impacted
by (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties which could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities
and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) tightening of the credit
markets. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or
other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory
developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity.

    All of our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at December 31,
2016.

     For additional information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements.

      The increase in total net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase
in the cash provided by our Adjusted OIBDA and related working capital items, primarily due to the impact of the CWC Acquisition,
(ii) a decrease in cash provided due to higher payments of interest, (iii) an increase in cash provided due to higher cash receipts
related to derivative instruments and (iv) a decrease in cash provided due to higher payments for taxes.

     Investing Activities. Our net cash flows from investing activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                           Year ended December 31,

Net cash used by investing activities:
 Liberty Global Group...................................................................................... $                (3,475.2) $      (3,429.0) $        (46.2)
 LiLAC Group ..................................................................................................                (441.1)          (490.6)           49.5

     Total............................................................................................................ $     (3,917.7) $      (3,829.4) $        (88.3)

     The increase in total net cash used by our investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in
cash used of $998.7 million associated with higher cash paid in connection with acquisitions, (ii) a decrease in cash used of $858.7
million associated with lower cash paid related to investments in and loans to affiliates and others, (iii) $147.3 million of cash
proceeds received from the sale of investments and (iv) an increase in cash used of $144.8 million due to higher capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures increased from $2,499.5 million during 2015 to $2,644.3 million during 2016 due to the net effect of (a) an
increase resulting from acquisitions, (b) a decrease resulting from FX and (c) a net increase in the local currency capital expenditures
of our subsidiaries, including a decrease associated with higher capital-related vendor financing.




                                                                                           II-75
     The capital expenditures that we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed
under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions
to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid.
In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude
amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements, and (ii) our total property and equipment
additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing
or capital lease arrangements. For further details regarding our property and equipment additions, see note 18 to our consolidated
financial statements. A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures,
as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, is set forth below:
                                                                                      Year ended December 31,

 Capital expenditures ....................................................... $ 2,153.9 $ 490.4 $ 2,644.3 $ 2,272.3 $ 227.2   $ 2,499.5

     The property and equipment additions attributable to the Liberty Global Group are primarily related to the European Division,
which accounted for $4,619.1 million and $3,844.3 million of Liberty Global Group’s property and equipment additions during
2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the European Division’s property and equipment additions is due to the net effect of
(i) an increase in expenditures for new build and upgrade projects, (ii) an increase in expenditures for support capital, such as
information technology upgrades and general support systems, (iii) a decrease due to FX, (iv) an increase due to the impact of the
BASE Acquisition and (v) an increase in expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment. During
2016 and 2015, the European Division’s property and equipment additions represented 26.8% and 22.6% of its revenue, respectively.

     Property and equipment additions attributable to the LiLAC Group increased during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily
due to the net effect of (i) an increase due to the impact of the CWC Acquisition, (ii) an increase in expenditures for the purchase
and installation of customer premises equipment, (iii) an increase in expenditures for new build and upgrade projects, (iv) an
increase in expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems, and (v) a
decrease due to FX. During 2016 and 2015, the LiLAC Group’s property and equipment additions represented 20.9% and 18.7%
of its revenue, respectively.

     We expect the percentage of revenue represented by our aggregate 2017 property and equipment additions to range from 29%
to 31% for the Liberty Global Group and 21% to 23% for the LiLAC Group. The increases in these percentages, as compared to
the corresponding 2016 percentages, are primarily attributable to anticipated increases in expenditures associated with the Network
Extensions. For additional information regarding the Network Extensions, see Overview above. The actual amount of the 2017
property and equipment additions of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group may vary from expected amounts for a
variety of reasons, including (a) changes in (1) the competitive or regulatory environment, (2) business plans, (3) our expected
future operating results or (4) foreign currency exchange rates and (b) the availability of sufficient capital. Accordingly, no assurance
can be given that our actual property and equipment additions will not vary materially from our expectations.

     Total............................................................................................................ $      (1,385.7) $     (2,037.8) $        652.1

     The decrease in total net cash used by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in
cash used of $352.2 million due to lower cash payments associated with the repurchase of Liberty Global ordinary shares, (ii) an
increase in cash used of $212.6 million related to lower net borrowings of debt, (iii) a decrease in cash used of $169.4 million due
to lower payments for financing costs, debt premiums and exchange offer consideration, (iv) a decrease in cash used of $162.4
million due to changes in cash collateral, (v) a decrease in cash used of $142.4 million related to lower purchases of additional
shares of our subsidiaries and (vi) a decrease in cash used of $87.5 million associated with call option contracts on Liberty Global
ordinary shares.

     The increase in total net cash used by our investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash
of $988.5 million associated with cash proceeds received during 2014 in connection with the Chellomedia Transaction, (ii) an
increase in cash used of $312.5 million associated with higher cash paid in connection with acquisitions and (iii) a decrease in
cash used of $184.9 million due to lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased from $2,684.4 million during 2014
to $2,499.5 million during 2015 due to the net effect of (a) an increase related to the Ziggo Acquisition, (b) a decrease due to FX
and (c) a net decrease in the local currency capital expenditures of our subsidiaries, primarily due to an increase in capital-related
vendor financing during 2015 as compared to 2014.

Property and equipment additions..................................... $ 3,910.2 $ 227.1                                     $ 4,137.3    $ 3,653.0   $ 256.2        $ 3,909.2
Assets acquired under capital-related vendor financing

      The property and equipment additions attributable to the Liberty Global Group are primarily related to the European Division,
which accounted for $3,844.3 million and $3,648.0 million of the Liberty Global Group’s property and equipment additions during
2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the European Division’s property and equipment additions is due to the net effect of
(i) a decrease due to FX, (ii) an increase due to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, (iii) an increase in expenditures for new build
and upgrade projects to expand service, (iv) an increase in expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades
and general support systems, and (v) a decrease in expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment.
During 2015 and 2014, the European Division’s property and equipment additions represented 22.6% and 21.5% of its revenue,
respectively.

     Property and equipment additions attributable to the LiLAC Group decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily
due to the net effect of (i) a decrease due to FX, (ii) an increase due to the impact of the Choice Acquisition, (iii) a decrease in
expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems, (iv) a decrease in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects to expand service and (v) a decrease in expenditures for the purchase and installation
of customer premises equipment. During 2015 and 2014, the LiLAC Group’s property and equipment additions represented 18.7%
and 21.3% of its revenue, respectively.

     Financing Activities. Our net cash flows from financing activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                           Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                                            2015             2014           Change
                                                                                                                                          in millions

Net cash used by financing activities:
 Liberty Global Group...................................................................................... $                (2,311.3) $      (4,574.8) $     2,263.5
 LiLAC Group ..................................................................................................                 363.7           (118.0)         481.7
  Inter-group eliminations..................................................................................                    (90.2)           432.7         (522.9)
     Total............................................................................................................ $     (2,037.8) $      (4,260.1) $     2,222.3

     The decrease in total net cash used by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in
cash used of $3,092.7 million related to higher net borrowings of debt, (ii) an increase in cash used of $735.6 million due to higher
cash payments associated with the repurchase of Liberty Global ordinary shares, (iii) a decrease in cash used of $118.3 million
related to a decrease in purchases of additional shares of our subsidiaries, (iv) an increase in cash used of $80.2 million due to
higher cash paid related to derivative instruments, (v) an increase in cash used of $43.5 million due to higher payments for financing
costs, debt premiums and exchange offer consideration and (vi) an increase in cash used of $36.6 million associated with call
option contracts on Liberty Global ordinary shares.

  Adjusted Free Cash Flow

     We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by our operating activities, plus (i) excess tax benefits related to the
exercise of share-based incentive awards, (ii) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and
unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions and (iii) expenses financed by an intermediary, less (a) capital expenditures, as reported
in our consolidated statements of cash flows, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and (c)
principal payments on capital leases (exclusive of the portions of the network lease in Belgium and the duct leases in Germany
that we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions), with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued
operations. We believe that our presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to our investors because this
measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Adjusted free cash flow should
not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations,
including debt repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view adjusted free cash flow as a
supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

(a)     Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation represent the excess of tax deductions over the related financial reporting
        share-based compensation expense. The hypothetical cash flows associated with these excess tax benefits are reported as
        an increase to cash flows from financing activities and a corresponding decrease to cash flows from operating activities in
        our consolidated statements of cash flows.

(b)     For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, expenses financed by an intermediary are treated as hypothetical
        operating cash outflows and hypothetical financing cash inflows when the expenses are incurred. When we pay the financing
        intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our adjusted
        free cash flow definition, we add back the hypothetical operating cash outflow when these financed expenses are incurred
        and deduct the financing cash outflows when we pay the financing intermediary.

(a)     The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our December 31, 2016 consolidated
        balance sheet other than debt and capital lease obligations. Our liability for uncertain tax positions in the various jurisdictions
        in which we operate ($358.9 million at December 31, 2016) has been excluded from the table as the amount and timing of
        any related payments are not subject to reasonable estimation.

(b)     Amounts are based on interest rates, interest payment dates, commitment fees and contractual maturities in effect as of
        December 31, 2016. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from the actual cash
        payments required in future periods. In addition, the amounts presented do not include the impact of our interest rate
        derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts.

     For information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. For
information concerning our commitments, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

     In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments
and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For
information regarding projected cash flows associated with these derivative instruments, see Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk — Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivatives below. For information regarding our
derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during 2016, 2015 and 2014,
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. For information concerning our defined benefit plans, see note 15 to our
consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

     In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties,
which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following
accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to
account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change:

    •    Impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill);
    •    Costs associated with construction and installation activities;
    •    Useful lives of long-lived assets;
    •    Fair value measurements; and
    •    Income tax accounting.
     We have discussed the selection of the aforementioned critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of
directors. For additional information concerning our significant accounting policies, see note 3 to our consolidated financial
statements.

  Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

    Carrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill) that
was held for use comprised 71.0% of our total assets at December 31, 2016.

     When circumstances warrant, we review the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets (other
than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse
changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which
we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see
below). If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying
value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar
assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets
to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

      We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily cable television franchise rights) for impairment
at least annually on October 1 and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative
assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-
likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit
to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to
as a “component”). If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be
charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to other indefinite-lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not
that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then estimate its fair value and any
excess of the carrying value over the fair value is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.

     When required, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of reporting units and underlying
long-lived and indefinite-lived assets. The equity of one of our reporting units, Telenet, is publicly traded in an active market. For
this reporting unit, our fair value determination is based on quoted market prices. For other reporting units, we typically determine
fair value using an income-based approach (discounted cash flows) based on assumptions in our long-range business plans and,
in some cases, a combination of an income-based approach and a market-based approach. With respect to our discounted cash
flow analysis used in the income-based approach, the timing and amount of future cash flows under these business plans require
estimates of, among other items, subscriber growth and retention rates, rates charged per product, expected gross margins and
Adjusted OIBDA margins and expected property and equipment additions. The development of these cash flows, and the discount
rate applied to the cash flows, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

                                                                 II-82
Our determination of the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital approach, which uses a market participant’s
cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. Based on the results of our 2016 qualitative
assessment of our reporting unit carrying values, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that fair value exceeded carrying
value for all of our reporting units.

    During the three years ended December 31, 2016, the most significant impairment charge that we recorded with respect to
our property and equipment and intangible assets was the $68.7 million impairment charge that we recorded during the fourth
quarter of 2014 to reduce the carrying amount of certain of Ziggo’s internal-use software assets. For additional information, see
note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

     Based on the results of our October 1, 2016 goodwill impairment test, a hypothetical decline of 20% or more in the fair value
of any of CWC’s reporting units could result in the need to record a goodwill impairment charge. At December 31, 2016, the
aggregate goodwill associated with the CWC reporting units was $5.5 billion. If, among other factors, (i) the equity values of the
LiLAC Group were to remain depressed or decline further or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or
other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods
that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived
assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

  Costs Associated with Construction and Installation Activities

     We capitalize costs associated with the construction of new cable and mobile transmission and distribution facilities and the
installation of new cable services. Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection (or drop) from our
cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of equipment for additional services,
such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-facing activities, such as reconnecting
customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed
as incurred.

     The nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves
significant judgment. In addition to direct external and internal labor and materials, we also capitalize other costs directly attributable
to our construction and installation activities, including dispatch costs, quality-control costs, vehicle-related costs and certain
warehouse-related costs. The capitalization of these costs is based on time sheets, time studies, standard costs, call tracking systems
and other verifiable means that directly link the costs incurred with the applicable capitalizable activity. We continuously monitor
the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and update the policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and
circumstances, such as the development of new products and services and changes in the manner that installations or construction
activities are performed.

  Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets

     We depreciate our property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The determination
of the useful lives of property and equipment requires significant management judgment, based on factors such as the estimated
physical lives of the assets, technological changes, changes in anticipated use, legal and economic factors, rebuild and equipment
swap-out plans, and other factors. Our intangible assets with finite lives primarily consist of customer relationships. Customer
relationship intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated weighted average life of the customer
relationships. The determination of the estimated useful life of customer relationship intangible assets requires significant
management judgment and is primarily based on historical and forecasted subscriber disconnect rates, adjusted when necessary
for risk associated with demand, competition, technological changes and other economic factors. We regularly review whether
changes to estimated useful lives are required in order to accurately reflect the economic use of our property and equipment and
intangible assets with finite lives. Any changes to estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Our depreciation and
amortization expense during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $5,801.1 million, $5,825.8 million and $5,500.1 million, respectively. A
10% increase in the aggregate amount of our depreciation and amortization expense during 2016 would have resulted in a $580.1
million or 20.7% decrease in our 2016 operating income.

  Fair Value Measurements

     U.S. GAAP provides guidance with respect to the recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements and for a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are
quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the
measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
                                                                    II-83
     Recurring Valuations. We perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to our derivative instruments, our fair value
method investments and certain instruments that we classify as debt, each of which are carried at fair value. We use (i) cash flow
valuation models to determine the fair values of our interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and (ii) a binomial
option pricing model to determine the fair values of our equity-related derivative instruments. We use quoted market prices when
available and, when not available, we use a combination of an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach
(market multiples of similar businesses) to determine the fair value of our fair value method investments. For a detailed discussion
of the inputs we use to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments and fair value method investments, see note 8 to our
consolidated financial statements. See also notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning our
fair value method investments and derivative instruments, respectively.
     Changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments, fair value method investments and certain instruments that we classify
as debt have had, and we believe will continue to have, a significant and volatile impact on our results of operations. During 2016,
2015 and 2014, we recognized net gains of $383.6 million, $971.7 million and $294.0 million, respectively, attributable to changes
in the fair values of these items.

     As further described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, actual amounts received or paid upon the settlement
or disposition of these investments and instruments may differ materially from the recorded fair values at December 31, 2016.

    For information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes
in market conditions, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Sensitivity Information below.

     Nonrecurring Valuations. Our nonrecurring valuations are primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition
accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable
valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts,
including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-
lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from
acquired net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage
third-party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization,
impairment charges and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we
believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded
through the application of acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to impairment assessments. For
additional information, including the specific weighted average discount rates that we used to complete certain nonrecurring
valuations, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding our acquisitions and long-lived assets,
see notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements, respectively.

  Income Tax Accounting

     We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income
tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted
tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. This process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the
ultimate tax impact of such items.

     Net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if we believe it more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Establishing or reducing a tax valuation allowance requires us to make assessments about the timing of future
events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2016,
the aggregate valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets was $6,015.4 million. The actual amount of deferred income
tax benefits realized in future periods will likely differ from the net deferred tax assets reflected in our December 31, 2016
consolidated balance sheet due to, among other factors, possible future changes in income tax law or interpretations thereof in the
jurisdictions in which we operate and differences between estimated and actual future taxable income. Any such factors could
have a material effect on our current and deferred tax positions as reported in our consolidated financial statements. A high degree
of judgment is required to assess the impact of possible future outcomes on our current and deferred tax positions.

     Tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have a presence are subject to varied interpretation, and many tax positions we take are
subject to significant uncertainty regarding whether the position will be ultimately sustained after review by the relevant tax
authority. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits,
that the position will be sustained upon examination. The determination of whether the tax position meets the more-likely-than-
not threshold requires a facts-based judgment using all information available. In a number of cases, we have concluded that the
                                                                II-84
more-likely-than-not threshold is not met and, accordingly, the amount of tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial
statements is different than the amount taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits for financial reporting purposes, but taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns, was $501.1 million,
of which $438.3 million would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering
amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances.

     We are required to continually assess our tax positions, and the results of tax examinations or changes in judgment can result
in substantial changes to our unrecognized tax benefits.

     We have taxable outside basis differences on certain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We do not recognize the deferred
tax liabilities associated with these outside basis differences when the difference is considered essentially permanent in duration.
In order to be considered essentially permanent in duration, sufficient evidence must indicate that the foreign subsidiary has
invested or will invest its undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. If
circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings will be remitted on a taxable basis
in the foreseeable future, a net deferred tax liability must be recorded for some or all of the outside basis difference. The assessment
of whether these outside basis differences are considered permanent in nature requires significant judgment and is based on
management’s intentions to reinvest the earnings of a foreign subsidiary indefinitely in light of anticipated liquidity requirements
and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2016, income and withholding taxes for which a net deferred tax liability might
otherwise be required have not been provided on an estimated $6.9 billion of cumulative temporary differences on non-U.S.
entities, including cumulative translation adjustments. If our plans or intentions change in the future due to liquidity or other
relevant considerations, we could decide that it would be prudent to repatriate significant funds or other assets from one or more
of our subsidiaries, even though we would incur a tax liability in connection with any such repatriation. If our plans or intentions
were to change in this manner, the recognition of all or a part of these outside basis differences could have an adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations.

    For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.




                                                                 II-85
Item 7A . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various foreign
countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse
changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and
processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

  Cash and Investments

     We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk
to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources
of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of our and our subsidiaries’ short-term liquidity requirements. In order to
mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in light of our and our subsidiaries’ forecasted
liquidity requirements. At December 31, 2016, $1,022.4 million or 62.8%, $298.9 million or 18.3%, and $268.2 million or 16.5%
of our consolidated cash balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and euros, respectively.

     We are exposed to market price fluctuations related to our investments in ITV, Sumitomo and Lionsgate shares. At December 31,
2016, the aggregate fair value of these investments was $1,015.4 million, $538.4 million and $128.6 million, respectively. All of
our ITV shares are held through the ITV Collar, and a portion of our Lionsgate shares are held through the Lionsgate Forward. In
addition, 60% of our Sumitomo shares are held through the Sumitomo Collar and 40% of our Sumitomo shares secure the Sumitomo
Share Loan. For information concerning the terms of (i) the ITV Collar and ITV Collar Loan, (ii) the Sumitomo Collar, Sumitomo
Collar Loan and Sumitomo Share Loan and (iii) the Lionsgate Forward and Lionsgate Loan, see note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements. For those shares that are held through the ITV Collar, the Sumitomo Collar and the Lionsgate Forward and the Sumitomo
shares that secure the Sumitomo Share Loan, our exposure to market risk is limited. For additional information concerning our
investments in ITV, Sumitomo and Lionsgate shares, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Foreign Currency Risk

     We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or
refinance such debt. Although we generally seek to match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the
functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause
us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched
debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using
derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2016,
substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying
operations. For additional information concerning the terms of our derivative instruments, see note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements.

      In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are
exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts,
notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in
our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In this regard, excluding CWC,
we currently expect that during 2017, (i) less than 1% of our revenue, (ii) approximately 1% to 3% of our direct costs of services
and our other operating and SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) and (iii) approximately 10% to
12% of our property and equipment additions will be denominated in non-functional currencies, including amounts denominated
in U.S. dollars, euros and British pound sterling. Our expectations with respect to our non-functional currency transactions in 2017
may differ from actual results. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from
agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can
reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In
this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks. Certain non-functional currency
risks related to our revenue, direct costs of services and other operating and SG&A expenses and property and equipment additions
were not hedged as of December 31, 2016. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note
7 to our consolidated financial statements.
                                                                  II-86
     We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against
the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign
currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency
translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a
negative impact on our comprehensive earnings or loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of FX. Our primary
exposure to FX risk during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was to the euro and British pound sterling as 43.2% and
27.5% of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and British
pound sterling, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Swiss
franc, the Chilean peso and other local currencies in Europe. We generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-
cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. For information
regarding certain currency instability risks with respect to the British pound sterling and euro, see Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview above.

     The relationship between (i) the euro, the British pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Hungarian forint, the Polish zloty, the
Czech koruna, the Romanian lei, the Chilean peso and the Jamaican dollar and (ii) the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency,
is shown below, per one U.S. dollar:

  Inflation and Foreign Investment Risk

    We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to labor, programming and other costs. While we attempt to increase our
revenue to offset increases in costs, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Therefore, costs could rise faster than
associated revenue, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. The economic
environment in the respective countries in which we operate is a function of government, economic, fiscal and monetary policies


                                                                                              II-87
and various other factors beyond our control that could lead to inflation. We are unable to predict the extent that price levels might
be impacted in future periods by the current state of the economies in the countries in which we operate.

  Interest Rate Risks

     We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed-rate and
variable-rate borrowings by our borrowing groups. Our primary exposure to variable-rate debt is through the EURIBOR-indexed
and LIBOR-indexed debt of UPC Broadband Holding, Virgin Media and Telenet, the EURIBOR-indexed debt of Unitymedia, the
LIBOR-indexed debt of CWC and the variable-rate debt of certain of our other subsidiaries.

     In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate
debt. Accordingly, we have entered into various derivative transactions to reduce exposure to increases in interest rates. We use
interest rate derivative contracts to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated
by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We also use interest rate cap and collar agreements that lock in a
maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from
declines in market rates. At December 31, 2016, we effectively paid a fixed interest rate on 96% of our total debt. The final maturity
dates of our various portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments generally fall short of the respective maturities of the underlying
variable-rate debt. In this regard, we use judgment to determine the appropriate maturity dates of our portfolios of interest rate
derivative instruments, taking into account the relative costs and benefits of different maturity profiles in light of current and
expected future market conditions, liquidity issues and other factors. For additional information concerning the terms of these
interest rate derivative instruments, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

     Weighted Average Variable Interest Rate. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal amount of our variable-rate
indebtedness aggregated $15.0 billion, and the weighted average interest rate (including margin) on such variable-rate indebtedness
was approximately 3.8%, excluding the effects of interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums
or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding,
and without giving effect to any interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts
and commitment fees, a hypothetical 50 basis point (0.50%) increase (decrease) in our weighted average variable interest rate
would increase (decrease) our annual consolidated interest expense and cash outflows by $75.0 million. As discussed above and
in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to increases
in variable interest rates. In this regard, increases in the fair value of these contracts generally would be expected to offset most
of the economic impact of increases in the variable interest rates applicable to our indebtedness to the extent and during the period
that principal amounts are matched with interest rate derivative contracts.

  Counterparty Credit Risk

      We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments
of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation
and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk
associated with our derivative instruments and undrawn debt facilities is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of
banks and financial institutions. With the exception of a limited number of instances where we have required a counterparty to
post collateral, neither party has posted collateral under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. Collateral
is generally not posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. Most of our cash
currently is invested in either (i) AAA credit rated money market funds, including funds that invest in government obligations, or
(ii) overnight deposits with banks having a minimum credit rating of A by Standard & Poor’s or an equivalent rating by Moody’s
Investor Service. To date, neither the access to nor the value of our cash and cash equivalent balances have been adversely impacted
by liquidity problems of financial institutions.

     At December 31, 2016, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (i) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of
$2,424.6 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,668.3 million and (iii) aggregate undrawn debt
facilities of $3,969.2 million.

     Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each
counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such
derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative
instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar
arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups.


                                                                  II-88
     Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination
payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty.
Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed
to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty,
even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our
ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we
will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value
of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty.

    In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may
be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel,
without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant
counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

     While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material
credit risk exposures, the current economic conditions and uncertainties in global financial markets have increased the credit risk
of our counterparties and we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable
to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial
condition and/or liquidity.

    Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key vendors, the financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our
operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows.

  Sensitivity Information

    Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes
in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated
with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency. For additional information, see

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2016:

    (i)     an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar would
            have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Virgin Media cross-currency and interest rate derivative
            contracts by approximately £821 million ($1,014 million);

    (ii)    an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased (decreased)
            the aggregate fair value of the Virgin Media cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately
            £120 million ($148 million); and

    (iii)   an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased

            contracts by approximately €76 million ($80 million); and

    (iv)    an instantaneous increase in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased the aggregate fair
            value of the UPC Broadband Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately €43 million
            ($45 million) and, conversely, a decrease of 50 basis points would have decreased the aggregate fair value by
            approximately €49 million ($52 million).

            ($179 million); and

    (ii)    an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased (decreased)

                               Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting


     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     Our management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, using the
criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2016. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein. Our evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal control of the following entities that we acquired in 2016:

                                                                                                                                             Total revenue included

                                            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
Liberty Global plc:

We have audited Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 excluded the following entities that were acquired in 2016:

                                                                                                              Total assets included in    Total revenue included in

The Board of Directors
Liberty Global plc:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedules I and II. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report
dated February 15, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

                                           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)      Basis of Presentation

    Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global) is a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales. In these
notes, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global or collectively to
Liberty Global and its subsidiaries. We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile
and other communications services to residential customers and businesses, with consolidated operations at December 31, 2016
in more than 30 countries.

     In Europe, we provide residential and business-to-business (B2B) services in (i) the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland
through Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media), (ii) Germany through Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia), (iii) Belgium through Telenet
Group Holding N.V. (Telenet), a 57.4%-owned subsidiary, and (iv) seven other European countries through UPC Holding B.V.
(UPC Holding). In addition, through the December 31, 2016 completion of the Dutch JV Transaction (as defined and described
in note 5), we provided residential and B2B services in the Netherlands through VodafoneZiggo Holding B.V., formerly known
as Ziggo Group Holding B.V., which we refer to herein as “Ziggo Group Holding.” Virgin Media, Unitymedia and UPC Holding
are each wholly-owned subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The operations of Virgin Media, Unitymedia, Telenet, UPC Holding and,
through December 31, 2016, Ziggo Group Holding are collectively referred to herein as the “European Division.”

     Outside of Europe, we provide residential and B2B services in (i) 18 countries, predominantly in Latin America and the
Caribbean, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (formerly known as Cable & Wireless
Communications Plc) (CWC), (ii) Chile through our wholly-owned subsidiary VTR.com SpA (VTR) and (iii) Puerto Rico through
Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC (Liberty Puerto Rico), an entity in which we hold a 60.0% ownership interest. CWC
also provides (a) B2B services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (b) wholesale services over its
sub-sea and terrestrial networks that connect over 30 markets in that region. CWC owns less than 100% of certain of its consolidated
subsidiaries, including Cable & Wireless Panama, SA (CWC Panama) (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns most of our operations
in Panama), The Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (CWC BTC) (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns all of our
operations in the Bahamas), Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited (CWC Jamaica) (an 82.0%-owned entity that owns the majority
of our operations in Jamaica) and Cable & Wireless Barbados Limited (CWC Barbados) (an 81.1%-owned entity that owns the
majority of our operations in Barbados). The operations of CWC, VTR and Liberty Puerto Rico are collectively referred to herein
as the “LiLAC Division.”

     On July 1, 2015, we completed the approved steps of the “LiLAC Transaction” whereby we (i) reclassified our then
outstanding Class A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares into corresponding classes of new Liberty Global ordinary
shares (collectively, the Liberty Global Shares) and (ii) capitalized a portion of our share premium account and distributed as a
dividend (or a “bonus issue” under U.K. law) our LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the LiLAC
Shares). In these notes, the term “Old Liberty Global Shares” refers to our previously-outstanding Class A, Class B and Class
C Liberty Global ordinary shares. Pursuant to the LiLAC Transaction, each holder of Class A, Class B and Class C Old Liberty
Global Shares remained a holder of the same amount and class of Liberty Global Shares and received one share of the corresponding
class of LiLAC Shares for each 20 Old Liberty Global Shares held as of the record date for such distribution. Accordingly, we
issued 12,625,362 Class A, 523,626 Class B and 30,776,883 Class C LiLAC Shares. Cash was issued in lieu of fractional LiLAC
Shares. The impact of the LiLAC Transaction on our capitalization and earnings (loss) per share presentation has been reflected
in these consolidated financial statements prospectively from July 1, 2015. Accordingly, (a) our net earnings (loss) attributed to
Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares relates to periods subsequent to July 1, 2015 and (b) our net loss attributed to Old Liberty
Global Shares relates to periods prior to July 1, 2015.

     The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are tracking shares. Tracking shares are intended by the issuing company
to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic performance of the
company as a whole. The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are intended to track the economic performance of the
Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, respectively (each as defined and described below). While the Liberty Global Group
and the LiLAC Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, neither group is a separate
legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking shares
have no direct claim to the group’s assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking
shares are shareholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors, and are subject to all of the risks and liabilities
of the parent corporation. We and our subsidiaries each continue to be responsible for our respective liabilities. Holders of Liberty
Global Shares, LiLAC Shares and any other of our capital shares designated as ordinary shares from time to time will continue
to be subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both Liberty Global
Shares and LiLAC Shares.

      The “LiLAC Group” comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed
to it (i) LGE Coral Holdco Limited (LGE Coral) and its subsidiaries, which include CWC, (ii) VTR Finance B.V. (VTR Finance)
and its subsidiaries, which include VTR, (iii) Lila Chile Holding B.V. (Lila Chile Holding), which is the parent entity of VTR
Finance, (iv) LiLAC Communications Inc. (formerly known as LiLAC Holdings Inc.) (LiLAC Communications) and its
subsidiaries, which include Liberty Puerto Rico, and (v) prior to July 1, 2015, the costs associated with certain corporate employees
of Liberty Global that are exclusively focused on the management of the LiLAC Group (the LiLAC Corporate Costs). Effective
July 1, 2015, these corporate employees were transferred to LiLAC Communications. The “Liberty Global Group” comprises
our businesses, assets and liabilities not attributed to the LiLAC Group, including Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding (through
December 31, 2016), Unitymedia, Telenet, UPC Holding, our corporate entities (excluding LiLAC Communications) and certain
other less significant entities.

     For additional information regarding our tracking share capital structure, including unaudited attributed financial information
of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    On January 31, 2014, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets (the Chellomedia Disposal Group) of Chellomedia
B.V. (Chellomedia) (the Chellomedia Transaction). Chellomedia held certain of our programming interests in Europe and Latin
America. We have accounted for the sale of the Chellomedia Disposal Group as a discontinued operation in our consolidated
financial statements. For additional information regarding our discontinued operation, see note 5.

     Unless otherwise indicated, ownership percentages and convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated
as of December 31, 2016.

(2)       Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  Accounting Changes

     In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a reduction of debt, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. For public
entities, ASU 2015-03 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted ASU 2015-03
on January 1, 2016 and, accordingly, deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction of debt in our December 31, 2016 and
2015 consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-03, we presented deferred financing costs in other assets,
net.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

      ASU 2014-09

     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which requires
an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers. ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU No. 2015-14, will replace existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes
effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This new standard permits the use of either
the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 using the cumulative
effect transition method. While we are continuing to evaluate the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial
statements, we have identified a number of our current revenue recognition policies that will be impacted by ASU 2014-09,
including the accounting for (i) time-limited discounts and free periods provided to our customers and (ii) certain up-front fees
charged to our customers. These impacts are discussed below:

      •   When we enter into contracts to provide services to our customers, we often provide time-limited discounts or free service
          periods. Under current accounting rules, we recognize revenue net of discounts during the promotional periods and do
          not recognize any revenue during free service periods. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue recognition will be accelerated for
          these contracts as the impact of the discount or free service period will be recognized uniformly over the total contractual
          period.



                                                                II-107
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


    •    When we enter into contracts to provide services to our customers, we often charge installation or other up-front fees. Under
         current accounting rules, installation fees related to services provided over our cable networks are recognized as revenue
         in the period during which the installation occurs to the extent these fees are equal to or less than direct selling costs. Under
         ASU 2014-09, these fees will generally be deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual period, or longer if
         the up-front fee results in a material renewal right.

    As the above revenue recognition changes have offsetting impacts and both result in a relatively minor shift in the timing of
revenue recognition, we currently do not expect ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact on our reported revenue.

     ASU 2014-09 will also impact our accounting for certain upfront costs directly associated with obtaining and fulfilling customer
contracts. Under our current policy, these costs are expensed as incurred unless the costs are in the scope of another accounting
topic that allows for capitalization. Under ASU 2014-09, the upfront costs that are currently expensed as incurred will be recognized
as assets and amortized to other operating expenses over a period that is consistent with the transfer to the customers of the goods
or services to which the assets relate, which we have generally interpreted to be the expected customer life. The impact of the
accounting change for these costs will be dependent on numerous factors, including the number of new subscriber contracts added
in any given period, but we expect the adoption of this accounting change will initially result in the deferral of a significant amount
of operating and selling costs.

     The ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 for both revenue recognition and costs to obtain and fulfill contracts will depend
on the promotions and offers in place during the period leading up to and after the adoption of ASU 2014-09.

    ASU 2016-02

     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), which, for most leases, will result in lessees
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet with additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU
2016-02 requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a
modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach also includes a number of optional practical expedients an
entity may elect to apply. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Although we are currently evaluating the effect that ASU
2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption of this standard will increase the number of
leases to be accounted for as capital leases in our consolidated balance sheet.

    ASU 2016-09

     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-
Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification within
the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-09 will result in, among other matters, the
immediate recognition for financial reporting purposes of excess tax benefits that currently are not recognized until such time as
these tax benefits can be realized as a reduction of income taxes payable.

    ASU 2017-04

     In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which
eliminates the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill as determined following the procedure
that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead,
a company should recognize any goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. ASU
2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal
years, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1,
2017. We expect the adoption of ASU 2017-04 to reduce the complexity surrounding the evaluation of our goodwill for impairment.

(3)      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions
are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible
accounts, programming and copyright expenses, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair
value measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation
activities, useful lives of long-lived assets, share-based compensation and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Reclassifications

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, including the reclassification
of deferred financing costs from other long-term assets to long-term debt and capital lease obligations and the reclassification of
certain costs between programming and other direct costs of services, other operating and SG&A expenses. For additional
information regarding the change in the classification of deferred financing costs, see “Accounting Changes” in note 2.

  Principles of Consolidation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all voting interest entities where
we exercise a controlling financial interest through the ownership of a direct or indirect controlling voting interest and variable
interest entities for which our company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

     Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and other investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities
of three months or less at the time of acquisition. We record money market funds at the net asset value reported by the investment
manager as there are no restrictions on our ability, contractual or otherwise, to redeem our investments at the stated net asset value
reported by the investment manager.

     Restricted cash consists of cash held in restricted accounts, including cash held as collateral for debt and other compensating
balances. Restricted cash amounts that are required to be used to purchase long-term assets or repay long-term debt are classified
as long-term assets. All other cash that is restricted to a specific use is classified as current or long-term based on the expected
timing of the disbursement. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our current and long-term restricted cash balances aggregated $39.1
million and $127.9 million, respectively.

     Our significant non-cash investing and financing activities are disclosed in our consolidated statements of equity and in notes
4, 7, 9, and 10.

  Trade Receivables

     Our trade receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Such allowance aggregated $193.4 million and
$115.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment
of probable loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We use a number of factors in determining the allowance, including,
among other things, collection trends, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk. The
allowance is maintained until either payment is received or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote.

     Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion
across many different countries worldwide. We also manage this risk by disconnecting services to customers whose accounts are
delinquent.


                                                                 II-109

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


  Investments

     We make elections, on an investment-by-investment basis, as to whether we measure our investments at fair value. Such
elections are generally irrevocable. With the exception of those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we
generally elect the fair value method. For those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we generally elect the
equity method.

     Under the fair value method, investments are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value are reported in realized and
unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair values of certain investments and debt, net, in our consolidated statements of
operations. All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment to be accounted for using the fair value method are
expensed as incurred. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are recorded at cost and are subsequently increased or
reduced to reflect our share of income or losses of the investee. All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment
to be accounted for using the equity method are included in the carrying amount of the investment. For additional information
regarding our fair value and equity method investments, see notes 6 and 8.

     Under the equity method, investments, originally recorded at cost, are adjusted to recognize our share of net earnings or losses
of the affiliates as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received, with our recognition of losses generally
limited to the extent of our investment in, and advances and commitments to, the investee. The portion of the difference between
our investment and our share of the net assets of the investee that represents goodwill is not amortized, but continues to be considered
for impairment. Intercompany profits on transactions with equity affiliates for which assets remain on our or our investee’s balance
sheet are eliminated to the extent of our ownership in the investee.

     Dividends from publicly-traded investees that are not accounted for under the equity method are recognized when declared
as dividend income in our consolidated statements of operations. Dividends from our equity method investees and all of our
privately-held investees are reflected as reductions of the carrying values of the applicable investments. Dividends that are deemed
to be (i) returns on our investments are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash
flows and (ii) returns of our investments are included in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of
cash flows.

     We continually review all of our equity and cost method investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the
cost basis is other-than-temporary. The primary factors we consider in our determination are the extent and length of time that the
fair value of the investment is below our company’s carrying value and the financial condition, operating performance and near-
term prospects of the investee, changes in the stock price or valuation subsequent to the balance sheet date, and the impacts of
exchange rates, if applicable. If the decline in fair value of an equity or cost method investment is deemed to be other-than-
temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value.

    Realized gains and losses are determined on an average cost basis. Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date.

  Financial Instruments

    Due to the short maturities of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term liquid investments, trade and other
receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other accrued and current liabilities, their respective
carrying values approximate their respective fair values. For information concerning the fair values of certain of our investments,
derivatives and debt, see notes 6, 7 and 10, respectively. For information regarding how we arrive at certain of our fair value
measurements, see note 8.

  Derivative Instruments

     All derivative instruments, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in
earnings. If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument are recorded in other comprehensive earnings or loss and subsequently reclassified into our consolidated
statements of operations when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value
of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. With the exception of a limited number of our foreign currency forward contracts,
we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.

                                                                II-110

                                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                               December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


     The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or financing activity
in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument and the classification of the
applicable underlying cash flows. For foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge capital expenditures, the net cash
received or paid is classified as an adjustment to capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For derivative
contracts that are terminated prior to maturity, the cash paid or received upon termination that relates to future periods is classified
as a financing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

     For information regarding our derivative instruments, see note 7.

  Property and Equipment

      Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. We capitalize costs associated with the construction
of new cable and mobile transmission and distribution facilities and the installation of new cable services. Capitalized construction
and installation costs include materials, labor and other directly attributable costs. Installation activities that are capitalized include
(i) the initial connection (or drop) from our cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation
of equipment for additional services, such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-
facing activities, such as reconnecting customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and
repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as incurred. Interest capitalized with respect to construction activities was not material
during any of the periods presented.

    Capitalized internal-use software is included as a component of property and equipment. We capitalize internal and external
costs directly associated with the development of internal-use software. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of
software licenses. Maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of an internal-use software
development project, are expensed as incurred.

     Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. Equipment
under capital leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.
Useful lives used to depreciate our property and equipment are assessed periodically and are adjusted when warranted. The useful
lives of cable and mobile distribution systems that are undergoing a rebuild are adjusted such that property and equipment to be
retired will be fully depreciated by the time the rebuild is completed. For additional information regarding the useful lives of our
property and equipment, see note 9.

    Additions, replacements and improvements that extend the asset life are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are charged to
operations.

      We recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is incurred if sufficient information is available
to make a reasonable estimate of fair values. Asset retirement obligations may arise from the loss of rights of way that we obtain
from local municipalities or other relevant authorities. Under certain circumstances, the authorities could require us to remove our
network equipment from an area if, for example, we were to discontinue using the equipment for an extended period of time or
the authorities were to decide not to renew our access rights. However, because the rights of way are integral to our ability to
deliver broadband communications services to our customers, we expect to conduct our business in a manner that will allow us
to maintain these rights for the foreseeable future. In addition, we have no reason to believe that the authorities will not renew our
rights of way and, historically, renewals have been granted. We also have obligations in lease agreements to restore the property
to its original condition or remove our property at the end of the lease term. Sufficient information is not available to estimate the
fair value of our asset retirement obligations in certain of our lease arrangements. This is the case for long-term lease arrangements
in which the underlying leased property is integral to our operations, there is not an acceptable alternative to the leased property
and we have the ability to indefinitely renew the lease. Accordingly, for most of our rights of way and certain lease agreements,
the possibility is remote that we will incur significant removal costs in the foreseeable future and, as such, we do not have sufficient
information to make a reasonable estimate of fair value for these asset retirement obligations.

    As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the recorded value of our asset retirement obligations was $96.3 million and $63.9 million,
respectively.




                                                                  II-111

  Intangible Assets

     Our primary intangible assets relate to goodwill, customer relationships and cable television franchise rights. Goodwill
represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Customer
relationships and cable television franchise rights are initially recorded at their fair values in connection with business combinations.

     Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives
to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment.

     We do not amortize our cable television franchise rights and certain other intangible assets as these assets have indefinite
lives. For additional information regarding the useful lives of our intangible assets, see note 9.

  Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

     When circumstances warrant, we review the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets (other
than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse
changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which
we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see
below). If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying
value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar
assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets
to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

      We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily cable television franchise rights) for impairment
at least annually on October 1 and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative
assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-
likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit
to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to
as a “component”). If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be
charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to other indefinite-lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not
that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then estimate its fair value and any
excess of the carrying value over the fair value is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.




                                                                 II-112

  Income Taxes

     Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax basis of assets
and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect
for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits,
that the position will be sustained upon examination. Net deferred tax assets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if we
believe it is more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Certain of our valuation allowances and tax
uncertainties are associated with entities that we acquired in business combinations. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax liabilities related to
investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration are not recognized
until it becomes apparent that such amounts will reverse in the foreseeable future. In order to be considered essentially permanent
in duration, sufficient evidence must indicate that the foreign subsidiary has invested or will invest its undistributed earnings
indefinitely, or that earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are
included in income tax benefit or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. For additional information on our income
taxes, see note 11.

  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

     The reporting currency of our company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign operations generally is the
applicable local currency for each foreign subsidiary and equity method investee. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
(including intercompany balances for which settlement is not anticipated in the foreseeable future) are translated at the spot rate
in effect at the applicable reporting date. With the exception of certain material transactions, the amounts reported in our consolidated
statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized
cumulative translation adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss in our consolidated statements of equity. With the exception of certain material transactions, the cash flows from
our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the applicable period in our consolidated statements of
cash flows. The impacts of material transactions generally are recorded at the applicable spot rates in our consolidated statements
of operations and cash flows. The effect of exchange rates on cash balances held in foreign currencies are separately reported in
our consolidated statements of cash flows.

     Transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are recorded based on exchange
rates at the time such transactions arise. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance
sheets related to these non-functional currency transactions result in transaction gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated
statements of operations as unrealized (based on the applicable period end exchange rates) or realized upon settlement of the
transactions.

  Revenue Recognition

     Service Revenue — Cable Networks. We recognize revenue from the provision of video, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services over our cable network to customers in the period the related services are provided. Installation revenue
(including reconnect fees) related to services provided over our cable network is recognized as revenue in the period during which
the installation occurs to the extent these fees are equal to or less than direct selling costs, which costs are expensed as incurred.
To the extent installation revenue exceeds direct selling costs, the excess revenue is deferred and amortized over the average
expected subscriber life.

    Sale of Multiple Products and Services. We sell video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets,
mobile services to our customers in bundled packages at a rate lower than if the customer purchased each product on a standalone
basis. Revenue from bundled packages generally is allocated proportionally to the individual services based on the relative
standalone price for each respective service.

     Mobile Revenue — General. Consideration from mobile contracts is allocated to the airtime service element and the handset
service element based on the relative standalone prices of each element. The amount of consideration allocated to the handset is
limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of future airtime services. Certain of our operations that provide

                                                                 II-113

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


mobile services offer handsets under a subsidized contract model, whereby upfront revenue recognition is limited to the upfront
cash collected from the customer as the remaining monthly fees to be received from the customer, including fees that may be
associated with the handset, are contingent upon delivering future airtime services. At certain of our operations, mobile customers
may choose to enter into two distinct contractual relationships: (i) a mobile handset contract and (ii) a mobile airtime services
contract (a Split-contract Program). Under the mobile handset contract, the customer takes full title to the handset upon delivery
and typically has the option to either (a) pay for the handset in cash upon delivery or (b) pay for the handset in installments over
a contractual period. Under these arrangements, the handset installment payments are not contingent upon delivering future airtime
services and the consideration allocated to the handset is not limited to the upfront cash collected.

     Mobile Revenue — Airtime Services. We recognize revenue from mobile services in the period the related services are provided.
Revenue from pre-pay customers is recorded as deferred revenue prior to the commencement of services and revenue is recognized
as the services are rendered or usage rights expire.

     Mobile Revenue — Handset Revenue. Arrangement consideration allocated to handsets is recognized as revenue when the
goods have been delivered and title has passed. For customers under a mobile handset installment contract that is independent of
a mobile airtime services contract, revenue is recognized upon delivery only if collectibility is reasonably assured. Our assessment
of collectibility is based principally on internal and external credit assessments as well as historical collection information for
similar customers. To the extent that collectibility of installment payments from the customer is not reasonably assured upon
delivery of the handset, handset revenue is recognized on a cash basis as customer payments are received.

    B2B Revenue. We defer upfront installation and certain nonrecurring fees received on B2B contracts where we maintain
ownership of the installed equipment. The deferred fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
arrangement or the expected period of performance.

     Promotional Discounts. For subscriber promotions, such as discounted or free services during an introductory period, revenue
is recognized only to the extent of the discounted monthly fees charged to the subscriber, if any.

    Subscriber Advance Payments and Deposits. Payments received in advance for the services we provide are deferred and
recognized as revenue when the associated services are provided.

    Sales, Use and Other Value-Added Taxes (VAT). Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales, use and other value-added taxes.

  Share-based Compensation

     We recognize all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee share-based incentive awards, based on
their grant-date fair values and our estimates of forfeitures. We recognize the grant-date fair value of outstanding awards as a
charge to operations over the vesting period. The cash benefits of tax deductions in excess of deferred taxes on recognized share-
based compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow. Payroll taxes incurred in connection with the vesting or exercise
of our share-based incentive awards are recorded as a component of share-based compensation expense in our consolidated
statements of operations.

    We use the straight-line method to recognize share-based compensation expense for our outstanding share awards that do not
contain a performance condition and the accelerated expense attribution method for our outstanding share awards that contain a
performance condition and vest on a graded basis.

      The grant date fair values for options, share appreciation rights (SARs) and performance-based share appreciation rights
(PSARs) are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the grant date fair values for restricted share units
(RSUs) and performance-based restricted share units (PSUs) are based upon the closing share price of Liberty Global ordinary
shares on the date of grant. We calculate the expected life of options and SARs granted by Liberty Global to employees based on
historical exercise trends. The expected volatility for options and SARs related to Liberty Global Shares is generally based on a
combination of (i) historical volatilities of Liberty Global Shares for a period equal to the expected average life of the awards and
(ii) volatilities implied from publicly-traded options for Liberty Global Shares. The expected volatility for options and SARs
related to LiLAC Shares is generally based on a combination of (a) historical volatilities of LiLAC Shares for a period equal to
the expected average life of the award and, if this data is unavailable, historical volatilities of ordinary shares of a relevant peer


                                                               II-114

group for a period equal to the expected average life of the award, and (b) volatilities implied from publicly-traded options for
LiLAC Shares where available.

    We generally issue new Liberty Global ordinary shares when Liberty Global options or SARs are exercised and when RSUs
and PSUs vest. Although we repurchase Liberty Global ordinary shares from time to time, the parameters of our share purchase
and redemption activities are not established solely with reference to the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation plans.

      For additional information regarding our share-based compensation, see note 13.

  Litigation Costs

      Legal fees and related litigation costs are expensed as incurred.

  Earnings or Loss per Share

    Basic earnings or loss per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings or loss per share presents the dilutive effect, if any, on a per share basis of potential
shares (e.g., options, SARs, PSARs, RSUs and convertible securities) as if they had been exercised, vested or converted at the
beginning of the periods presented.

  Weighted average ordinary shares (diluted EPS computation)..........................................................................                     899,969,654

     We reported a loss from continuing operations attributable to holders of Liberty Global Shares for the period from July 1,
2015 through December 31, 2015. Therefore, the potentially dilutive effect at December 31, 2015 of the following items was not
included in the computation of diluted loss per share attributable to holders of Liberty Global Shares because their inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive to the computation or, in the case of certain PSUs and performance grant units (PGUs), because such
awards had not yet met the applicable performance criteria: (i) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding
options, SARs, PSARs and RSUs of approximately 43.3 million, (ii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to PSUs
and PGUs of approximately 4.5 million and (iii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to obligations that may be
settled in cash or shares of approximately 2.7 million.

     We reported losses from continuing operations attributable to holders of Old Liberty Global Shares for the period from January
1, 2015 through June 30, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, the potentially dilutive effect at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014 of the following items was not included in the computation of diluted loss per share attributable to holders
of Old Liberty Global Shares because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the computation or, in the case of certain

(4)       Acquisitions

  Pending Acquisitions

     SFR BeLux. On December 22, 2016, a subsidiary of Telenet entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Coditel Brabant
sprl, operating under the SFR brand (SFR BeLux), for €400.0 million ($421.9 million) on a cash and debt free basis. SFR BeLux
provides cable services to households and businesses in Brussels, Wallonia and Luxembourg and offers mobile services in Belgium
through a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with BASE, as defined and described below. Telenet intends to
finance the acquisition of SFR BeLux through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents and available liquidity under
its revolving credit facilities. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval from the relevant
competition authorities, and is expected to close during the second half of 2017.

     Multimedia. On October 18, 2016, our subsidiary UPC Polska SP Z.o.o. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the
cable business of Multimedia Polska S.A. (Multimedia), the third-largest cable operator in Poland, for cash consideration of PLN
3.0 billion ($718.2 million), which is equal to the enterprise value assigned to Multimedia for purposes of this transaction. We
intend to finance the acquisition of Multimedia with existing liquidity. The final purchase price is subject to potential downward
adjustments for the operational and financial performance of Multimedia prior to closing. The transaction is subject to customary
closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to close in late 2017 or early 2018.

      2016 Acquisitions

     CWC. On May 16, 2016, we acquired CWC for shares of Liberty Global (the CWC Acquisition). Under the terms of the
transaction, CWC shareholders received in the aggregate: 31,607,008 Class A Liberty Global Shares, 77,379,774 Class C Liberty
Global Shares, 3,648,513 Class A LiLAC Shares and 8,939,316 Class C LiLAC Shares. Further, immediately prior to the acquisition,
CWC declared a special cash dividend (the Special Dividend) to its shareholders in the amount of £0.03 ($0.04 at the transaction
date) per CWC share. The Special Dividend was paid to CWC shareholders promptly following the closing and the payment,

                                                                          II-117

together with fees and expenses related to the acquisition, was funded with CWC liquidity, including incremental debt borrowings,
and LiLAC Group corporate liquidity. We acquired CWC in order to achieve certain financial, operational and strategic benefits
through the integration of CWC with our existing operations in the LiLAC Group.

     The CWC Acquisition triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which CWC operates. The
regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Seychelles and
the Cayman Islands, have not completed their review of the CWC Acquisition or granted their approval. While we expect to receive
all outstanding approvals, such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on
CWC’s operations and financial condition.

    For accounting purposes, the CWC Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of CWC by Liberty Global. In this regard, the
equity and cash consideration paid to acquire CWC is set forth below (in millions):

Class A Liberty Global Shares (a)........................................................................................................................ $                   1,167.2
Class C Liberty Global Shares (a)........................................................................................................................                     2,803.5

Class C LiLAC Shares (a) ....................................................................................................................................                   375.3
Special Dividend (b).............................................................................................................................................               193.8
   Total................................................................................................................................................................. $   4,683.9
_______________

(a)      Represents the fair value of the 31,607,008 Class A Liberty Global Shares, 77,379,774 Class C Liberty Global Shares,
         3,648,513 Class A LiLAC Shares and 8,939,316 Class C LiLAC Shares issued to CWC shareholders in connection with
         the CWC Acquisition. These amounts are based on the market price per share at closing on May 16, 2016 of $36.93, $36.23,
         $39.50 and $41.98, respectively.

(b)      Represents the Special Dividend of £0.03 ($0.04 at the transaction date) per CWC share paid pursuant to the scheme of
         arrangement based on 4,433,222,313 outstanding shares of CWC on May 16, 2016.

     We have accounted for the CWC Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price
was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of CWC based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. The preliminary opening balance
sheet is subject to adjustment based on our final assessment of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities.
Although most items in the valuation process remain open, the items with the highest likelihood of changing upon finalization of
the valuation process include property and equipment, goodwill, customer relationships, trademarks, noncontrolling interests and
income taxes. A summary of the purchase price and the preliminary opening balance sheet of CWC at the May 16, 2016 acquisition
date is presented in the following table (in millions):

Cash and cash equivalents.................................................................................................................................... $             210.8

    Total purchase price (d) .................................................................................................................................. $        4,683.9
_______________

(a)      The goodwill recognized in connection with the CWC Acquisition is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take advantage
         of CWC’s existing terrestrial and sub-sea networks to gain immediate access to potential customers and (ii) synergies that
         are expected to be achieved through the integration of CWC with other operations in the LiLAC Group.

(b)      Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. At May 16, 2016, the preliminary assessment
         of the weighted average useful life of CWC’s intangible assets was approximately eight years.

(c)      Represents the estimated aggregate fair value of the noncontrolling interests in CWC’s subsidiaries as of May 16, 2016.

(d)      Excludes direct acquisition costs of $132.0 million, including $118.5 million incurred during 2016, which are included in
         impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.

     Following completion of the CWC Acquisition, we attributed CWC to the LiLAC Group, with the Liberty Global Group
being granted an inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group representing the fair value (as determined by our board of directors) of
the Liberty Global Shares issued as part of the purchase consideration. On July 1, 2016, we distributed (as a bonus issue) 117,430,965
LiLAC Shares to Liberty Global Group shareholders on a pro-rata basis (the LiLAC Distribution), thereby eliminating the Liberty
Global Group's inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group. The LiLAC Distribution was accounted for prospectively effective July
1, 2016.

     BASE. On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired Telenet Group BVBA, formerly known as BASE Company NV (BASE), for
a cash purchase price of €1,318.9 million ($1,494.3 million at the transaction date) (the BASE Acquisition). BASE is the third-
largest mobile network operator in Belgium. We expect that the BASE Acquisition will provide Telenet with cost-effective long-
term mobile access to effectively compete for future growth opportunities in the Belgium mobile market. The BASE Acquisition
was funded through a combination of €1.0 billion ($1.1 billion at the transaction date) of new debt facilities and existing liquidity
of Telenet. The acquisition was approved by the European Commission subject to Telenet’s agreement to divest both the JIM
Mobile prepaid customer base and BASE’s 50% stake in Viking Co NV (Viking) to MEDIALAAN NV. In February 2016, Telenet
completed the sale of its stake in Viking. The divestiture of the JIM Mobile prepaid customer base is expected to occur during the
third quarter of 2017.

     We have accounted for the BASE Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price
was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of BASE based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of the purchase
price and the opening balance sheet of BASE at the February 11, 2016 acquisition date is presented in the following table. The

  2015 Acquisition

     On June 3, 2015, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with the parent of Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Company Inc.,
dba Choice Cable TV (Choice) and following regulatory approval, one of our subsidiaries, together with investment funds affiliated
with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, Searchlight), acquired 100% of Choice (the Choice Acquisition). Choice is
a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico. We acquired Choice in order to achieve certain financial, operational and
strategic benefits through the integration of Choice with Liberty Puerto Rico. The combined business is 60.0%-owned by our
company and 40.0%-owned by Searchlight.

     The purchase price for Choice of $276.4 million was funded through (i) Liberty Puerto Rico’s incremental debt borrowings,
net of discount and fees, of $259.1 million, (ii) cash of $10.5 million and (iii) an equity contribution from Searchlight of $6.8
million.




                                                                                         II-120

     2014 Acquisition

     On November 11, 2014 (the Ziggo Acquisition Date), pursuant to a merger protocol (the Ziggo Merger Protocol) with
respect to an offer to acquire all of the shares of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo) that we did not already own (the Ziggo Offer), we
gained control of Ziggo through the acquisition of 136,603,794 additional Ziggo shares, which increased our ownership interest
in Ziggo to 88.9% (the Ziggo Acquisition). From November 12, 2014 through November 19, 2014, we acquired 18,998,057
additional Ziggo shares, further increasing our ownership interest in Ziggo to 98.4% (the Ziggo NCI Acquisition). Ziggo is a
provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands. We acquired Ziggo in order
to achieve certain financial, operational and strategic benefits through the integration of Ziggo with with our then-existing operations
in the Netherlands and our other European operations.

       On December 31, 2016, our operations in the Netherlands were contributed to the Dutch JV, as defined and described in note
5.

     Pursuant to the Ziggo Merger Protocol, Ziggo shareholders who tendered their Ziggo shares received an offer price of (i)
0.2282 Class A Old Liberty Global Shares, (ii) 0.5630 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (iii) €11.00 ($13.71 at the applicable
rates) in cash for each Ziggo share that they tendered. In connection with the completion of the Ziggo Acquisition and the Ziggo
NCI Acquisition, we (a) issued an aggregate of 35,508,342 Class A and 87,603,842 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (b)
paid aggregate cash consideration of €1,711.6 million ($2,133.6 million at the applicable rates) to holders of Ziggo ordinary shares.

    On December 3, 2014, we initiated a statutory squeeze-out procedure in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code (the Statutory
Squeeze-out) in order to acquire the remaining 3,162,605 Ziggo shares not tendered through November 19, 2014. Under the
Statutory Squeeze-out, which was completed during the second quarter of 2015, Ziggo shareholders other than Liberty Global
received cash consideration of €39.78 ($44.91 at the applicable rates) per share, plus interest, for an aggregate of €125.9 million
($142.2 million at the applicable rates). This amount was approved in April 2015 by the Enterprise Court in the Netherlands.

                                                                                         II-121

                                                            December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


   For accounting purposes, (i) the Ziggo Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of Ziggo by Liberty Global and (ii) the Ziggo
NCI Acquisition and the Statutory Squeeze-out were treated as the acquisitions of a noncontrolling interest.

     In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator filed an appeal against the European Commission regarding
its decision to approve the Ziggo Acquisition. We are not a party to the appeal and we do not expect that the filing of this appeal
will have any impact on the ongoing integration and development of our operations in the Netherlands.

    For accounting purposes, the Ziggo Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of Ziggo by Liberty Global. In this regard, the
equity and cash consideration paid to acquire Ziggo plus the fair value of our pre-existing investment in Ziggo on the Ziggo
Acquisition Date is set forth below (in millions):

Class A Old Liberty Global Shares (a)................................................................................................................. $                      1,448.7

(a)      Represents the value assigned to the 31,172,985 Class A and 76,907,936 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares issued to Ziggo
         shareholders in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition through the Ziggo Acquisition Date. These amounts are based on
         (i) the exchange ratios specified by the Ziggo Merger Protocol, (ii) the applicable closing per share prices of Class A and
         Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (iii) 136,603,794 ordinary shares of Ziggo tendered in the Ziggo Offer through the
         Ziggo Acquisition Date.

(b)      Represents the cash consideration paid in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition.

(c)      Represents the fair value of the 41,329,850 shares of Ziggo held by Liberty Global and its subsidiaries immediately prior
         to the Ziggo Acquisition.

     We have accounted for the Ziggo Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price
was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of Ziggo based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of the purchase
price and the opening balance sheet for the Ziggo Acquisition as of the Ziggo Acquisition Date is presented in the following table.
The opening balance sheet presented below reflects our final purchase price allocation (in millions):

(b)     The goodwill recognized in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition was primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take
        advantage of Ziggo’s existing advanced broadband communications network to gain immediate access to potential customers
        and (ii) synergies that were expected to be achieved through the integration of Ziggo with our then-existing operations in
        the Netherlands and our other European operations.

(c)     Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. As of the Ziggo Acquisition Date, the weighted
        average useful life of Ziggo’s intangible assets was approximately ten years.

(d)     Represents the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in Ziggo as of the Ziggo Acquisition Date.

(e)     Excludes direct acquisition costs of $84.1 million incurred through December 31, 2014, which are included in impairment,
        restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statement of operations.

     We have accounted for the Ziggo NCI Acquisition as an equity transaction, with the carrying amount of the noncontrolling
interest adjusted to reflect the change in ownership of Ziggo. The difference between the fair value of consideration paid and the
amount by which the noncontrolling interest was adjusted has been recognized as additional paid-in capital in our consolidated
statement of equity. The impact of the Ziggo NCI Acquisition is summarized in the following table (in millions):

Reduction of noncontrolling interests .................................................................................................................. $        927.2
Additional paid-in capital.....................................................................................................................................    23.5
  Fair value of consideration paid (a) ................................................................................................................ $         950.7

(a)     Represents (i) the value assigned to the 4,335,357 Class A and 10,695,906 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares issued to
        Ziggo shareholders and (ii) cash consideration of €209.0 million ($260.7 million at the applicable rates) paid to Ziggo
        shareholders, based on the 18,998,057 ordinary shares of Ziggo tendered in connection with the Ziggo NCI Acquisition.

    The cash consideration paid in the Ziggo Acquisition and the Ziggo NCI Acquisition was funded with a combination of debt
and our existing liquidity.

(5)        Dutch JV Transaction and Discontinued Operation

  Dutch JV Transaction

     On December 31, 2016, pursuant to a Contribution and Transfer Agreement with Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone) and one
of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, we and Liberty Global Europe Holding B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary, contributed Ziggo
Group Holding and its subsidiaries (including Liberty Global Netherlands Content B.V., referred to herein as “Ziggo Sport”) to
VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., a newly-formed 50:50 joint venture (referred to herein as the “Dutch JV”). Ziggo Sport,
which became a subsidiary of Ziggo Group Holding during the fourth quarter of 2016, operates premium sports channels in the
Netherlands. The Dutch JV combined Ziggo Group Holding with Vodafone’s mobile businesses in the Netherlands (Vodafone
NL) to create a national unified communications provider in the Netherlands with complementary strengths across video,
broadband, mobile and B2B services (the Dutch JV Transaction). As a result of the Dutch JV Transaction, effective December
31, 2016 we no longer consolidate Ziggo Group Holding. For additional information regarding our investment in the Dutch JV,
see note 6.

     On January 4, 2017, in connection with the completion of the Dutch JV Transaction, our company received cash of €2.2 billion
($2.3 billion at the transaction date) comprising (i) our 50% share of the €2.8 billion ($2.9 billion at the transaction date) of net
proceeds from the various debt financing arrangements entered into by certain subsidiaries of Ziggo Group Holding during the
third quarter of 2016, which proceeds were held in escrow through December 31, 2016, and (ii) an equalization payment from

                                                                                           II-125
                                                               LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                               Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                           December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


Vodafone of €802.9 million ($840.8 million at the transaction date) that is subject to post-closing adjustments. Our right to receive
this cash is reflected in our December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet as a current receivable from the Dutch JV.

     In connection with the Dutch JV Transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $520.8 million, net of the recognition of a
cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $714.5 million. This gain, which was calculated by deducting the carrying value
of Ziggo Group Holding (including the related foreign currency translation loss) from the sum of (i) the fair value assigned to our
50% interest in the Dutch JV and (ii) the cash received pursuant to the equalization payment, includes $260.4 million related to
the remeasurement of our retained investment in Ziggo Group Holding. For information regarding our approach to the valuation
of our interest in the Dutch JV, see note 8.

    Our consolidated statements of operations include aggregate earnings (loss) before income taxes attributable to Ziggo Group
Holding and Ziggo Sport of ($276.4 million), ($534.5 million) and $270.2 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
December 31, 2016 carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities associated with Ziggo Group Holding, which
was contributed into the Dutch JV, are summarized below (in millions):

Assets:
 Cash and cash equivalents ................................................................................................................................. $                  6.1

  Discontinued Operation

     On January 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the Chellomedia Disposal Group to AMC Networks Inc. for €750.0 million
($1,013.1 million at the applicable rate) in cash. Accordingly, the Chellomedia Disposal Group is reflected as a discontinued
operation in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for 2014. The assets disposed of pursuant to the Chellomedia
Transaction exclude Chellomedia’s premium sports and film channels in the Netherlands. In connection with the sale of the
Chellomedia Disposal Group, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $342.2 million. This pre-tax gain is net of a $64.0 million cumulative
foreign currency translation loss, which was reclassified to net loss from accumulated other comprehensive earnings. The associated
income tax expense of $9.5 million differs from the amount computed by applying the U.K. statutory income tax rate in effect at
the time of 21.5% primarily due to the fact that (i) the transaction was not subject to taxation in the U.K. and (ii) most elements
of the transaction were not subject to taxation in the Netherlands or the U.S. The net after-tax gain of $332.7 million is included
in gain on disposal of discontinued operation, net of taxes, in our consolidated statement of operations.

     Certain of our broadband communications operations will continue to receive programming services from the Chellomedia
Disposal Group through contracts that were negotiated as part of the disposal. As such, Liberty Global will have continuing cash
outflows associated with the Chellomedia Disposal Group through at least 2017. However, our involvement as an ongoing customer
of the Chellomedia Disposal Group does not disqualify discontinued operations classification because (i) the ongoing cash outflows
are not considered significant to the Chellomedia Disposal Group and (ii) Liberty Global does not possess any rights within the
ongoing contractual arrangements that would allow us to exert influence over the Chellomedia Disposal Group.

                                                                                          II-126

                                                            December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


  Equity Method Investments

     Dutch JV. On December 31, 2016, we completed the Dutch JV Transaction. Each of Liberty Global and Vodafone (each a
“Shareholder”) holds 50% of the issued share capital of the Dutch JV. The Shareholders intend for the Dutch JV to be funded
solely from its net cash flow from operations and third-party financing. We account for our 50% interest in the Dutch JV, which
has been attributed to the Liberty Global Group, as an equity method investment. We consider the Dutch JV to be a related party.
For additional information regarding the formation of the Dutch JV, see note 5.

     In connection with the formation of the Dutch JV, the Shareholders entered into a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders
Agreement). The Shareholders Agreement contains customary provisions for the governance of a 50:50 joint venture that result
in Liberty Global and Vodafone having joint control over decision making with respect to the Dutch JV.

     The Shareholders Agreement also provides (i) for a dividend policy that requires the Dutch JV to distribute all unrestricted
cash to the Shareholders every two months (subject to the Dutch JV maintaining a minimum amount of cash and complying with
the terms of its financing arrangements) and (ii) that the Dutch JV will be managed with a leverage ratio of between 4.5 and 5.0
times EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to its existing financing arrangements) with the Dutch JV undertaking periodic
recapitalizations and/or refinancings accordingly.

     Each Shareholder has the right to initiate an initial public offering (IPO) of the Dutch JV after the third anniversary of the
closing, with the opportunity for the other Shareholder to sell shares in the IPO on a pro rata basis. Subject to certain exceptions,
the Shareholders Agreement prohibits transfers of interests in the Dutch JV to third parties until the fourth anniversary of the
closing. After the fourth anniversary, each Shareholder will be able to initiate a sale of all of its interest in the Dutch JV to a third
party and, under certain circumstances, initiate a sale of the entire Dutch JV; subject, in each case, to a right of first offer in favor
of the other Shareholder.

     Pursuant to an agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Dutch JV (the Framework Agreement), Liberty
Global will provide certain services to the Dutch JV on a transitional or ongoing basis (collectively, the Dutch JV Services).
Pursuant to the terms of the Framework Agreement, the ongoing services will be provided for a period of four to six years depending
on the type of service, while transitional services will be provided for a period of not less than 12 months after which both parties
shall be entitled to terminate based on specified notice periods. The Dutch JV Services provided by Liberty Global will consist
primarily of (i) technology and other services and (ii) capital-related expenditures for assets that will be used by or will otherwise
benefit the Dutch JV. Liberty Global will charge both fixed and variable fees to the Dutch JV for the Dutch JV Services it provides
during the term of the Framework Agreement, including estimated total fees of approximately €120 million ($127 million) during
2017 and minimum fees of approximately €100 million ($105 million) and €75 million ($79 million) during 2018 and 2019,
respectively. The estimated fees for the Dutch JV Services during 2017 include approximately €23 million ($24 million) of costs
that were related to goods and services that were centrally purchased by a Liberty Global corporate subsidiary and passed through
to our Netherlands segment, which in turn reported these costs as operating expenses in 2016. Beginning in 2017, these costs will
remain in Liberty Global's operating expenses and will therefore offset a portion of the fees for the Dutch JV Services. The charges
for the Dutch JV Services will be included in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.

      The summarized financial condition of the Dutch JV as of December 31, 2016 is set forth below (in millions):

Current assets ........................................................................................................................................................... $    3,589.8

(a)      Amount includes a $21.0 million payable to Liberty Global for services provided to Ziggo Group Holding through
         December 31, 2016. We have included the corresponding receivable amount in other current assets in our consolidated
         balance sheet.

  Fair Value Investments

     ITV. At December 31, 2016, we owned 398,515,510 shares of ITV plc (ITV), a commercial broadcaster in the U.K. Our ITV
shares represented less than 10.0% of the total outstanding shares of ITV as of June 30, 2016, the most current publicly-available
information. The aggregate purchase price paid to acquire our investment in ITV was financed through borrowings under secured
borrowing agreements (the ITV Collar Loan). All of the ITV shares we hold are subject to a share collar (the ITV Collar) and
pledged as collateral under the ITV Collar Loan. Under the terms of the ITV Collar, the counterparty has the right to re-use all of
the pledged ITV shares. For additional information regarding the ITV Collar, see note 7.

    Sumitomo. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we owned 45,652,043 shares of Sumitomo Corporation (Sumitomo) common
stock. Our Sumitomo shares represented less than 5% of Sumitomo’s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2016, the most
current publicly-available information. These shares secure the Sumitomo Collar Loan and the Sumitomo Share Loan, each as
defined and described in note 7.

    ITI Neovision. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we owned a 17.0% interest in ITI Neovision S.A. (ITI Neovision), a privately-
held direct-to-home (DTH) operator in Poland.

     Lionsgate. On November 12, 2015, we acquired an aggregate of 5.0 million shares of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.
(Lionsgate) common stock, at a price of $39.02 per share, for an investment of $195.1 million. The aggregate purchase price of
the Lionsgate shares was financed using working capital, including $70.9 million of cash received pursuant to a variable prepaid
forward transaction with respect to 2.5 million Lionsgate shares (the Lionsgate Forward). The Lionsgate Forward has economic
characteristics similar to a collar plus a loan that is collateralized by a pledge of the aforementioned 2.5 million shares (the Lionsgate
Loan). Under the terms of the Lionsgate Forward, the counterparty does not have the right to re-use the pledged Lionsgate shares
without permission from Liberty Global. On December 8, 2016, Lionsgate acquired Starz, LLC in a cash and stock transaction.
Under the terms of the transaction, the existing share capital of Lionsgate was restructured such that each share of previously-
existing Lionsgate common stock was converted into 0.5 newly-issued voting shares and 0.5 newly-issued non-voting shares. As
a result, our original 5.0 million shares of Lionsgate were converted into 2.5 million shares of Lionsgate voting stock and 2.5
million shares of Lionsgate non-voting stock. The terms of the Lionsgate Forward were also amended to include both classes of
shares. Our Lionsgate shares represented less than 5% of the total outstanding shares of Lionsgate as of November 1, 2016, the
most current publicly available information. For additional information regarding the Lionsgate Forward, see note 7.

(7)      Derivative Instruments

     In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against (i) increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate
debt, (ii) foreign currency movements, particularly with respect to borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency of the borrowing entity and (iii) decreases in the market prices of certain publicly traded securities that we own.
In this regard, through our subsidiaries, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and
foreign currency exposure with respect to the U.S. dollar ($), the euro (€), the British pound sterling (£), the Swiss franc (CHF),
the Chilean peso (CLP), the Czech koruna (CZK), the Hungarian forint (HUF), Indian rupee (INR), the Jamaican dollar (JMD),
the Philippine peso (PHP), the the Polish zloty (PLN) and the Romanian lei (RON).

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


_______________

(a)   Our current derivative liabilities, long-term derivative assets and long-term derivative liabilities are included in other current
      and accrued liabilities, other assets, net, and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.

(b)   We consider credit risk in our fair value assessments. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, (i) the fair values of our cross-
      currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented assets have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments
      aggregating $93.1 million and $64.0 million, respectively, and (ii) the fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate
      derivative contracts that represented liabilities have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating
      $71.5 million and $86.5 million, respectively. The adjustments to our derivative assets relate to the credit risk associated
      with counterparty nonperformance, and the adjustments to our derivative liabilities relate to credit risk associated with our
      own nonperformance. In all cases, the adjustments take into account offsetting liability or asset positions within a given
      contract. Our determination of credit risk valuation adjustments generally is based on our and our counterparties’ credit risks,
      as observed in the credit default swap market and market quotations for certain of our subsidiaries’ debt instruments, as
      applicable. The changes in the credit risk valuation adjustments associated with our cross-currency and interest rate derivative
      contracts resulted in net losses of $16.4 million, $9.3 million and $120.9 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
      These amounts are included in realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net, in our consolidated statements
      of operations. For further information regarding our fair value measurements, see note 8.

(c)   Our equity-related derivative instruments primarily include the fair value of (i) the ITV Collar (ii) the share collar with respect
      to the shares of Sumitomo held by our company (the Sumitomo Collar), (iii) the Lionsgate Forward and (iv) at December
      31, 2015, Virgin Media’s conversion hedges with respect to Virgin Media’s 6.50% convertible senior notes (the Virgin Media
      Capped Calls). The fair values of the ITV Collar, the Sumitomo Collar and the Lionsgate Forward do not include credit risk
      valuation adjustments as we assume that any losses incurred by our company in the event of nonperformance by the respective
      counterparty would be, subject to relevant insolvency laws, fully offset against amounts we owe to such counterparty pursuant
      to the related secured borrowing arrangements.

  Counterparty Credit Risk

     We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default
on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and
concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is
spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. With the exception of a limited number of
instances where we have required a counterparty to post collateral, neither party has posted collateral under the derivative instruments
of our subsidiary borrowing groups. At December 31, 2016, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with
an aggregate fair value of $2,424.6 million.

     Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each
counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such
derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative
instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar
arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups.

      Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination
payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly,
it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially
or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though
it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so
will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured
creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we
have obtained from that counterparty.

                                                                                         II-133

     In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may
be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without
any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty
or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

Details of our Derivative Instruments

     In the following tables, we present the details of the various categories of our subsidiaries’ derivative instruments. For each
subsidiary with multiple derivative instruments that mature within the same calendar month, the notional amounts are shown in the

        derivative instruments are interest payments and receipts.

  Equity-related Derivative Instruments

    ITV Collar and Secured Borrowing. The ITV Collar comprises (i) purchased put options exercisable by Liberty Global
Incorporated Limited (Liberty Global Limited), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and (ii) written call options exercisable by the
counterparty. The ITV Collar effectively hedges the value of our investment in ITV shares from losses due to market price decreases
below the put option price while retaining a portion of the gains from market price increases up to the call option price. The fair
value of the ITV Collar as of December 31, 2016 was a net asset of $311.9 million, which is classified as non-current in our
consolidated balance sheet. For additional information regarding our investment in ITV, see note 6. The ITV Collar has settlement
dates ranging from October 2017 through May 2019.

      The ITV Collar and related agreements also provide Liberty Global Limited with the ability to effectively finance the purchase
of its ITV shares pursuant to the ITV Collar Loan. In July 2014 and in connection with our initial investment in ITV, Liberty Global
Limited borrowed £446.9 million ($764.5 million at the transaction date) under the ITV Collar Loan. In July 2015 and in connection
with an additional investment in ITV (the Additional ITV Investment), Liberty Global Limited (i) modified the purchased put
option and written call option strike prices within the ITV Collar and (ii) increased its borrowings under the ITV Collar Loan,
resulting in net cash received of $92.0 million. The amount received in connection with the Additional ITV Investment includes
$77.5 million of cash borrowings under the ITV Collar Loan that were not required to fund the Additional ITV Investment and
$14.5 million related to the ITV Collar Loan modifications. Immediately prior to the completion of these modifications, the fair
value of the ITV Collar was a $270.5 million liability. In connection with the ITV Collar modifications, this liability was effectively
transferred on a non-cash basis to the principal amount of the ITV Collar Loan.

     At December 31, 2016, borrowings under the ITV Collar Loan were secured by all 398,515,510 of our ITV shares, which have
been placed into a custody account. The ITV Collar Loan was issued at a discount with a zero coupon rate and has an average
implied yield of 139 basis points (1.39%). The ITV Collar Loan, which has maturity dates consistent with the ITV Collar and
contains no financial covenants, provides for customary representations and warranties, events of default and certain adjustment
and termination events. Under the terms of the ITV Collar, the counterparty has the right to re-use the pledged ITV shares held in
the custody account, but we have the right to recall the shares that are re-used by the counterparty subject to certain costs. In addition,
the counterparty retains dividends on the ITV shares that the counterparty would need to borrow from the custody account to hedge
its exposure under the ITV Collar (an estimated 390 million shares at December 31, 2016).

     Sumitomo Collar and Secured Borrowing. The Sumitomo Collar comprises purchased put options exercisable by Liberty
Programming Japan LLC (Liberty Programming Japan), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and written call options exercisable by
the counterparty with respect to a portion of the Sumitomo shares owned by Liberty Programming Japan. At December 31, 2016,
the Sumitomo Collar effectively hedges the value of 27,391,305, or 60%, of our Sumitomo shares from losses due to market price
decreases below the put strike price. The Sumitomo Collar provides for a projected gross cash ordinary dividend to be paid per
Sumitomo share during the term of the Sumitomo Collar. If the actual dividend paid does not exactly match the projected dividend,
then an adjustment amount shall be payable between the parties to the Sumitomo Collar depending on the dividend actually paid
by Sumitomo. The Sumitomo Collar may, at the option of Liberty Programming Japan, be settled in Sumitomo shares or in cash.
The Sumitomo Collar also includes a purchased fair value put option, which effectively provides Liberty Programming Japan with
the ability to sell the Sumitomo shares when the market price is trading between the put and call strike prices. The fair value of the
Sumitomo Collar as of December 31, 2016 was a net asset of $179.9 million, which is classified as non-current in our consolidated
balance sheet.

     The Sumitomo Collar and related agreements also provide Liberty Programming Japan with the ability to borrow funds on a
secured basis. Borrowings under these agreements (the Sumitomo Collar Loan) are secured by 60% of our Sumitomo shares and
bear interest at 1.883%. The pledge arrangement entered into by Liberty Programming Japan provides that Liberty Programming
Japan will be able to exercise all voting and consensual rights and, subject to the terms of the Sumitomo Collar, receive dividends
on the Sumitomo shares. Borrowings under the Sumitomo Collar Loan are included in our long-term debt and capital lease obligations
in our consolidated balance sheets. For additional information, see note 10.

    The Sumitomo Collar and the Sumitomo Collar Loan each mature in five equal semi-annual installments, the first and second
of which became due on May 22, 2016 and November 22, 2016. In May and November 2016, Liberty Programming Japan borrowed

                                                                 II-139

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


shares of Sumitomo pursuant to a securities lending arrangement (the Sumitomo Share Loan) to settle the first and second
installments due on the Sumitomo Collar Loan. The Sumitomo Share Loan, which we have elected to account for at fair value,
bears interest at 1.10% and matures on the fifth anniversary of the respective borrowing dates. The Sumitomo Share Loan, together
with the Sumitomo Collar, effectively hedge 100% of our Sumitomo shares from losses due to market price decreases. The Sumitomo
Share Loan is secured by 40% of our Sumitomo shares. These shares were released from the Sumitomo Collar Loan after settlement
of the first and second installments.

     Lionsgate Forward and Secured Borrowing. The Lionsgate Forward has the economic equivalent of (i) purchased put options
exercisable by Liberty Global Limited and (ii) written call options exercisable by the counterparty. The Lionsgate Forward effectively
hedges the value of 2.5 million of our Lionsgate shares from losses due to market price decreases below the put option price while
retaining a portion of the gains from market price increases up to the call option price. The fair value of the Lionsgate Forward as
of December 31, 2016 was a net asset of $23.6 million, which is classified as non-current in our consolidated balance sheet. For
additional information regarding our investment in Lionsgate, see note 6. The Lionsgate Forward has settlement dates ranging from
July 2019 through March 2022.

     The Lionsgate Forward and related agreements also provide Liberty Global Limited with the ability to effectively finance a
portion of the purchase of its Lionsgate shares pursuant to the Lionsgate Loan. In November 2015, Liberty Global Limited borrowed
$69.7 million under the Lionsgate Loan. At December 31, 2016, borrowings under the Lionsgate Loan were secured by 2.5 million
of our Lionsgate shares, which have been placed into a custody account. The Lionsgate Loan was issued at a discount with a zero
coupon rate and an average implied yield of 350 basis points (3.5%). The Lionsgate Loan, which has maturity dates consistent with
the Lionsgate Forward and contains no financial covenants, provides for customary representations and warranties, events of default
and certain adjustment and termination events. Under the terms of the Lionsgate Forward, the counterparty does not have the right
to re-use the pledged Lionsgate shares without permission from Liberty Global. In addition, Liberty Global Limited is obligated to
share with the counterparty the economic benefit of any dividends paid during the term of the pledge based on a formula that takes
into account a theoretical hedging position by the counterparty under the Lionsgate Forward (an estimated 1.7 million shares at
December 31, 2016).

     Ziggo Collar and Secured Borrowing. During 2013, Liberty Global Limited entered into a share collar (the Ziggo Collar) and
secured borrowing arrangement (the Ziggo Collar Loan) with respect to the then owned 24,957,000 Ziggo shares. The Ziggo Collar
was comprised of (i) purchased put options exercisable by Liberty Global Limited and (ii) sold call options exercisable by the
counterparty. Prior to the Ziggo Acquisition, the Ziggo Collar effectively hedged the value of a portion of our investment in Ziggo
shares from significant losses due to market price decreases below the put option price while retaining a portion of the gains from
market price increases up to the call option price. The Ziggo Collar and related agreements also provided Liberty Global Limited
with the ability to effectively finance the purchase of certain of its Ziggo shares pursuant to the Ziggo Collar Loan. Upon completion
of the Ziggo Acquisition (see note 4), the Ziggo Collar was terminated and the Ziggo Collar Loan was settled.

     Virgin Media Capped Calls. During 2010, Virgin Media entered into the Virgin Media Capped Calls in order to offset a portion
of the dilutive effects associated with the exchange of certain exchangeable notes of Virgin Media. During 2013, and in connection
with the exchange of certain exchangeable notes of Virgin Media, we settled 93.8% of the notional amount of the Virgin Media
Capped Calls. During 2016, the remaining outstanding notional amount of the Virgin Media Capped Calls was settled for cash
proceeds of $36.2 million.

        dates within the disclosed range of maturity dates. We account for these contracts using hedge accounting.

(8)        Fair Value Measurements

     We use the fair value method to account for (i) certain of our investments, (ii) our derivative instruments, (iii) certain instruments
that we classify as debt and (iv) the Sumitomo Share Loan. The reported fair values of these investments and instruments as of
December 31, 2016 likely will not represent the value that will be paid or received upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of
these assets and liabilities. In the case of the investments that we account for using the fair value method, the values we realize
upon disposition will be dependent upon, among other factors, market conditions and the forecasted financial performance of the
investees at the time of any such disposition. With respect to our derivative and certain debt instruments, we expect that the values
realized generally will be based on market conditions at the time of settlement, which may occur at the maturity of the derivative
instrument or at the time of the repayment or refinancing of the underlying debt instrument.

     U.S. GAAP provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting
entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within

                                                                                   II-141

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability. We record transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during
which the transfer occurred. During 2016, no such transfers were made.

     All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures, swap rates and certain of the inputs for our weighted average cost of capital
calculations) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These
inputs, or interpolations or extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves,
forward interest and currency rates and weighted average cost of capital rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market
value assessments from the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal
valuations and investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values
of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our internal valuations.

     For our investments in ITV, Sumitomo and Lionsgate, the recurring fair value measurements are based on the quoted closing
price of the respective shares at each reporting date. Accordingly, the valuations of these investments fall under Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy. Our other investments that we account for at fair value are privately-held companies, and therefore, quoted market
prices are unavailable. The valuation technique we use for such investments is a combination of an income approach (discounted
cash flow model based on forecasts) and a market approach (market multiples of similar businesses). With the exception of certain
inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used to value these
investments are based on unobservable inputs derived from our assumptions. Therefore, the valuation of our privately-held
investments falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Any reasonably foreseeable changes in assumed levels of unobservable
inputs for the valuations of our Level 3 investments would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

     During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into the Sumitomo Share Loan. As the primary input for this recurring fair
value measurement is the quoted market price of the borrowed shares of Sumitomo, we believe this valuation falls under Level 1
of the fair value hierarchy.

     The recurring fair value measurement of our equity-related derivative instruments are based on binomial option pricing models,
which require the input of observable and unobservable variables such as exchange-traded equity prices, risk-free interest rates,
dividend yields and forecasted volatilities of the underlying equity securities. The valuations of our equity-related derivative
instruments are based on a combination of Level 1 inputs (exchange traded equity prices), Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures and
swap rates) and Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities). As changes in volatilities could have a significant impact on the overall
valuations over the terms of the derivative instruments, we have determined that these valuations fall under Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. At December 31, 2016, the valuations of the ITV Collar, the Sumitomo Collar and the Lionsgate Forward were
not significantly impacted by forecasted volatilities.

     In order to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk, we have entered into (i) various derivative instruments
and (ii) certain instruments that we classify as debt, as further described in notes 7 and 10, respectively. The recurring fair value
measurements of these instruments are determined using discounted cash flow models. With the exception of the inputs for the
U.S. dollar to Jamaican dollar cross-currency swaps (the Sable Currency Swap) held by Sable, most of the inputs to these
discounted cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable Level 2 data for substantially the full term of these
instruments. This observable data mostly includes interest rate futures and swap rates, which are retrieved or derived from available
market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we do not otherwise alter this data in performing our valuations.
We incorporate a credit risk valuation adjustment in our fair value measurements to estimate the impact of both our own
nonperformance risk and the nonperformance risk of our counterparties. Our and our counterparties’ credit spreads represent our
most significant Level 3 inputs, and these inputs are used to derive the credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to these
instruments. As we would not expect changes in our or our counterparties’ credit spreads to have a significant impact on the
valuations of these instruments, we have determined that these valuations (other than the Sable Currency Swap valuation) fall
under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Due to the lack of Level 2 inputs for the Sable Currency Swap valuation, we believe this
valuation falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our cross-currency
and interest rate swaps are quantified and further explained in note 7.

     Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment
assessments, acquisition accounting and the accounting for our initial investment in the Dutch JV. These nonrecurring valuations
include the valuation of reporting units, customer relationship and other intangible assets, property and equipment, the implied

                                                                II-142
                                                              LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC

                                                          December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


value of goodwill and the valuation of our initial investment in the Dutch JV. The valuation of private reporting units and our
initial investment in the Dutch JV is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses. With the exception of certain inputs
for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used in
our discounted cash flow analyses, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our assumptions. The valuation of customer
relationships is primarily based on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess
earnings methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the customer relationship, considering such
factors as estimated customer life, the revenue expected to be generated over the life of the customer relationship, contributory
asset charges and other factors. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering
factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence. The implied
value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if
the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, with the residual amount allocated to goodwill. All of our
nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During
2016, 2015 and 2014, we performed nonrecurring valuations for the purpose of determining (i) the acquisition accounting for the
CWC Acquisition, the BASE Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and the Ziggo Acquisition and (ii) the valuation of our initial
investment in the Dutch JV. The weighted average discount rates used in the preliminary valuation of the customer relationships
acquired as a result of the CWC Acquisition ranged from 8.8% to 12.8%. None of the valuations for the BASE Acquisition had a
significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet. We used discount rates of (a) 11.75% and 12.25% for our respective valuations
of the customer relationships and cable television franchise rights acquired as a result of the Choice Acquisition and (b) 8.50%
for our valuation of the customer relationships acquired as a result of the the Ziggo Acquisition. The weighted average cost of
capital used to value our initial investment in the Dutch JV was 7.0%. For information regarding our acquisitions, see note 4. For
information regarding our investment in the Dutch JV, see note 6.

     A summary of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis is as follows:

(a)     Represents goodwill associated with Ziggo Group Holding, which was contributed to the Dutch JV on December 31, 2016.
        For additional information, see note 5.

(b)     Represents enterprise-level goodwill that is allocated to our Puerto Rico segment for purposes of our impairment tests.

    Based on the results of our October 1, 2016 goodwill impairment test, a hypothetical decline of 20% or more in the fair value
of any of CWC’s reporting units could result in the need to record a goodwill impairment charge. At December 31, 2016, the
aggregate goodwill associated with the CWC reporting units was $5.5 billion. If, among other factors, (i) the equity values of the
LiLAC Group were to remain depressed or decline further or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or
other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods


                                                                                II-146

that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived
assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

    At December 31, 2016 and 2015 and based on exchange rates as of those dates, our accumulated goodwill impairments were
$180.4 million and $186.8 million, respectively. These amounts represent accumulated impairments related to our broadband
communications operations in Romania, which operations are included within the European Division’s Central and Eastern Europe
segment.

(a)     Represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2016 for all borrowings outstanding pursuant to
        each debt instrument, including any applicable margin. The interest rates presented represent stated rates and do not include
        the impact of derivative instruments, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees,
        all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums
        or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs, our weighted average interest rate on our
        aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness was 5.0% (including 4.7% for the Liberty Global Group and 6.8% for the
        LiLAC Group) at December 31, 2016. For information regarding our derivative instruments, see note 7.

                                                      December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


(b)   Unused borrowing capacity represents the maximum availability under the applicable facility at December 31, 2016 without
      regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. At December 31, 2016, based on
      the applicable leverage covenants, the full amount of unused borrowing capacity was available to be borrowed under each
      of the respective subsidiary facilities and there were no restrictions on the respective subsidiary's ability to make loans or
      distributions from this availability to Liberty Global or its subsidiaries or other equity holders, except as shown in the table
      below. In the following table, for each facility that is subject to limitations on borrowing availability, we present (i) the
      actual borrowing availability under the respective facility and (ii) for each subsidiary where the ability to make loans or
      distributions from this availability is limited, the amount that can be loaned or distributed to Liberty Global or its subsidiaries
      or other equity holders. The amounts presented below assume no changes from December 31, 2016 borrowing levels and
      are based on the applicable covenant and other limitations in effect within each borrowing group at December 31, 2016,
      both before and after considering the impact of the completion of the December 31, 2016 compliance requirements. For
      information concerning certain refinancing transactions completed subsequent to December 31, 2016 that could have an
      impact on unused borrowing capacity and/or the availability to be borrowed, loaned or distributed, see note 20.

(c)   The estimated fair values of our debt instruments are determined using the average of applicable bid and ask prices (mostly
      Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy) or, when quoted market prices are unavailable or not considered indicative of fair value,
      discounted cash flow models (mostly Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The discount rates used in the cash flow models
      are based on the market interest rates and estimated credit spreads of the applicable entity, to the extent available, and other
      relevant factors. For additional information regarding fair value hierarchies, see note 8.

(d)   The VM Revolving Facility (as defined and described under VM Credit Facilities below) is a multi-currency revolving
      facility with maximum borrowing capacity equivalent to £675.0 million ($833.3 million).

(e)   Represents amounts owed pursuant to interest-bearing vendor financing arrangements that are used to finance certain of
      our property and equipment additions and, to a lesser extent, certain of our operating expenses, including amounts associated
      with Ziggo Group Holding at December 31, 2015. These obligations are generally due within one year and include VAT
      that was paid on our behalf by the vendor. Repayments of vendor financing obligations are included in repayments and
      repurchases of debt and capital lease obligations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

(f)   On December 31, 2016, we completed the Dutch JV Transaction. For additional information, see note 5.

(g)   During 2016, the first two tranches of the Sumitomo Collar Loan were settled, resulting in a loss on debt modification and
      extinguishment, net, of $9.6 million. For information regarding the Sumitomo Collar Loan, see note 7.

(h)   Represents amounts associated with certain derivative-related borrowing instruments, including $128.9 million carried at
      fair value. For information regarding fair value hierarchies, see note 8.

(j)   The VTR Credit Facility is the senior secured credit facility of VTR and certain of its subsidiaries and comprises a $160.0
      million facility (the VTR Dollar Credit Facility) and a CLP 22.0 billion ($32.8 million) facility (the VTR Peso Credit
      Facility), each of which were undrawn at December 31, 2016. The VTR Dollar Credit Facility and the VTR Peso Credit
      Facility have fees on unused commitments of 1.1% and 1.34% per year, respectively. The interest rate for the VTR Dollar
      Credit Facility is LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The interest rate for the VTR Peso Credit Facility is the applicable interbank
      offered rate for Chilean pesos in the relevant interbank market plus a margin of 3.35%. Borrowings under the VTR Dollar

      (1)      Primarily represents Unitymedia’s obligations under duct network lease agreements with Telekom Deutschland
               GmbH (Deutsche Telekom), an operating subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG, as the lessor. The original contracts
               were concluded in 2000 and 2001 and have indefinite terms, subject to certain mandatory statutory termination rights
               for either party after a term of 30 years. With certain limited exceptions, the lessor generally is not entitled to terminate
               these leases. For information regarding litigation involving these duct network lease agreements, see note 17.

      (2)      At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Telenet’s capital lease obligations included €341.2 million ($359.9 million) and
               €329.3 million ($347.3 million), respectively, associated with Telenet’s lease of the broadband communications
               network of the four associations of municipalities in Belgium, which we refer to as the pure intercommunalues or
               the “PICs.” All capital expenditures associated with the PICs network are initiated by Telenet, but are executed and
               financed by the PICs through additions to this lease that are repaid over a 15-year term. These amounts do not include
               Telenet’s commitment related to certain operating costs associated with the PICs network. For additional information
               regarding this commitment, see note 17.

  General Information

    At December 31, 2016, most of our outstanding debt had been incurred by one of our seven primary "borrowing groups."
These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within Virgin Media, Unitymedia, UPC
Holding, Telenet, CWC, VTR Finance and Liberty Puerto Rico.

     Credit Facilities. Each of our borrowing groups has entered into one or more credit facility agreements with certain financial
institutions. Each of these credit facilities contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

                                                                                       II-152
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


    •    Our credit facilities contain certain consolidated net leverage ratios, as specified in the relevant credit facility, which are
         required to be complied with on an incurrence and/or maintenance basis;

    •    Our credit facilities contain certain restrictions which, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the
         relevant borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and
         acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets, in each case, subject to certain customary and agreed
         exceptions and (iv) make certain restricted payments to their direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to
         Liberty Global) through dividends, loans or other distributions, subject to compliance with applicable covenants;

    •    Our credit facilities require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums
         payable under the relevant credit facility and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their
         shares or, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable
         thereunder;

    •    In addition to certain mandatory prepayment events, the instructing group of lenders under the relevant credit facility
         may cancel the commitments thereunder and declare the loans thereunder due and payable after the applicable notice
         period following the occurrence of a change of control (as specified in the relevant credit facility);

    •    Our credit facilities contain certain customary events of default, the occurrence of which, subject to certain exceptions
         and materiality qualifications, would allow the instructing group of lenders to (i) cancel the total commitments, (ii)
         accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments thereunder and/or (iii) declare that all or part of the
         loans be payable on demand;

    •    Our credit facilities require members of the relevant borrowing group to observe certain affirmative and negative
         undertakings and covenants, which are subject to certain materiality qualifications and other customary and agreed
         exceptions; and

    •    In addition to customary default provisions, our credit facilities generally include certain cross-default and cross-
         acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness of members of the relevant borrowing group, subject to agreed
         minimum thresholds and other customary and agreed exceptions.

     Senior and Senior Secured Notes. Certain of our borrowing groups have issued senior and/or senior secured notes. In general,
our senior and senior secured notes (i) are senior obligations of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group that
rank equally with all of the existing and future senior debt of such issuer and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt
of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group, (ii) contain, in most instances, certain guarantees from other members
of the relevant borrowing group (as specified in the applicable indenture) and (iii) with respect to our senior secured notes, are
secured by certain pledges or liens over the assets and/or shares of certain members of the relevant borrowing group. In addition,
the indentures governing our senior and senior secured notes contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

    •    Our notes contain certain customary incurrence-based covenants. In addition, our notes provide that any failure to pay
         principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace period, or any acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of the
         issuer or certain subsidiaries, over agreed minimum thresholds (as specified under the applicable indenture), is an event
         of default under the respective notes;

    •    Our notes contain certain restrictions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the relevant borrowing
         group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii) create
         certain security interests over their assets, in each case, subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions and (iv) make
         certain restricted payments to its direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to Liberty Global) through
         dividends, loans or other distributions, subject to compliance with applicable covenants;

    •    If the relevant issuer or certain of its subsidiaries (as specified in the applicable indenture) sell certain assets, such issuer
         must offer to repurchase the applicable notes at par, or if a change of control (as specified in the applicable indenture)
         occurs, such issuer must offer to repurchase all of the relevant notes at a redemption price of 101%; and



                                                                 II-153
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


    •    Our senior secured notes contain certain early redemption provisions including the ability to, during each 12-month period
         commencing on the issue date for such notes until the applicable call date, redeem up to 10% of the principal amount of
         the notes to be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus
         accrued and unpaid interest.

     SPE Notes. From time to time, we create special purpose financing entities (SPEs), which are 100% owned by third parties,
for the primary purpose of facilitating the offering of senior and senior secured notes, which we collectively refer to as the "SPE
Notes." In this regard, SPE Notes have been issued, and are outstanding at December 31, 2016, by UPCB Finance IV Limited
(UPCB Finance IV, the UPCB SPE), and Telenet Finance V Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance V) and Telenet Finance VI
Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance VI), collectively the "Telenet SPEs."

    The SPEs used the proceeds from the issuance of SPE Notes to fund term loan facilities under their respective borrowing
group (as further described below), each a “Funded Facility” and collectively the “Funded Facilities.” Each SPE is dependent
on payments from the relevant borrower under the applicable Funded Facility in order to service its payment obligations under
each respective SPE Note. Although none of the respective borrowing entities under the Funded Facilities have any equity or
voting interest in any of the relevant SPEs, each of the Funded Facility term loans creates a variable interest in the respective SPE
for which the relevant borrowing entity is the primary beneficiary. As such, each borrowing entity under the relevant Funded
Facility and its parent entities, including Liberty Global, are required to consolidate the relevant SPEs. As a result, the amounts
outstanding under the Funded Facilities are eliminated in the respective borrowing group’s and Liberty Global’s consolidated
financial statements.

     Pursuant to the respective indentures for the SPE Notes (the SPE Indentures) and the respective accession agreements for
the Funded Facilities, the call provisions, maturity and applicable interest rate for each Funded Facility are the same as those of
the related SPE Notes. The SPEs, as lenders under the relevant credit facility for each respective borrowing group, are treated the
same as the other lenders under the respective credit facility, with benefits, rights and protections similar to those afforded to the
other lenders. Through the covenants in the applicable SPE Indentures and the applicable security interests over (i) all of the issued
shares of the relevant SPE and (ii) the relevant SPE’s rights under the applicable Funded Facility granted to secure the relevant
SPE’s obligations under the relevant SPE Notes, the holders of the SPE Notes are provided indirectly with the benefits, rights,
protections and covenants granted to the SPEs as lenders under the respective credit facility. The SPEs are prohibited from incurring
any additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions under the SPE Indentures.

(a)   Except as described in (d) below, amounts represent total third-party facility amounts at December 31, 2016.

(b)   At December 31, 2016, our availability under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility was limited to €676.0 million
      ($713.0 million). When the relevant December 31, 2016 compliance reporting requirements have been completed, and
      assuming no changes from the December 31, 2016 borrowing levels, we anticipate that the full amount of unused borrowing
      capacity under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility will be available to be borrowed. UPC Facility AM has a fee on
      unused commitments of 1.1% per year.

(c)   Amounts are net of discounts and deferred financing costs, where applicable.

(d)   As further discussed in the above description of the UPCB SPE Notes, the amounts borrowed by UPC Financing Partnership
      (UPC Financing) outstanding under UPC Facilities AK and AL are eliminated in Liberty Global’s consolidated financial
      statements.

      2016 Refinancing Transactions. In August 2016, UPC Broadband Holding entered into UPC Facility AN. UPC Facility AN
was issued at 99.5% of par and is subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.0%. The net proceeds from UPC Facility AN were used to prepay
(i) in full the $1,305.0 million outstanding principal amount under UPC Facility AH, (ii) in full the $675.0 million outstanding
principal amount under UPC Facility AC, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium, to UPCB
Finance V Limited (UPCB Finance V) and, in turn, UPCB Finance V used such proceeds to fully redeem the $675.0 million
principal amount of its 7.250% senior secured notes and (iii) 10% of the $750.0 million original principal amount under UPC
Facility AD, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium, to UPCB Finance VI Limited (UPCB
Finance VI) and, in turn, UPCB Finance VI used such proceeds to redeem 10% of its $750.0 million original principal amount
of 6.875% senior secured notes due January 15, 2022 (the UPCB Finance VI Notes). The redemption price for the UPCB Finance
VI Notes was 103% of the applicable redeemed principal amount. In connection with these transactions, UPC Holding recognized
a loss on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $48.8 million. This loss includes (a) the payment of $34.2 million of
redemption premium, (b) the write-off of $11.0 million of deferred financing costs and (c) the write-off of unamortized discount
of $3.6 million.

      In November 2016, UPC Financing entered into UPC Facility AO. UPC Facility AO was issued at 99.75% of par and is subject
to a EURIBOR floor of 0.0%. The net proceeds from UPC Facility AO, in conjunction with existing cash, were used to prepay in
full the remaining $600.0 million outstanding principal amount under UPC Facility AD, together with accrued and unpaid interest
and the related prepayment premium to UPCB Finance VI and, in turn, UPCB Finance VI used such proceeds to redeem the
remaining $600.0 million outstanding principal amount of the UPCB Finance VI Notes. The redemption price for the UPCB
Finance VI Notes was 103% of the applicable redeemed principal amount. In connection with these transactions, UPC Holding
recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $28.3 million. This loss includes (i) the payment of $23.0
million of redemption premium and (ii) the write-off of $5.3 million of deferred financing costs.

Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see note 20.

     2015 and 2014 Refinancing Transactions. During 2015 and 2014, UPC Holding completed a number of refinancing transactions
that generally resulted in lower interest rates or extended maturities under the the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. In
connection with these transactions, UPC Holding recognized losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $76.9 million
and $16.5 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. These losses include (i) the payment of $53.5 million of redemption premium
in 2015, (ii) the write-off of deferred financing costs of $18.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively, and (iii) the write-off of
unamortized discounts of $4.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively.

      Ziggo Group Holding Debt

     2016 Financing Transactions. During 2016, prior to the completion of the Dutch JV Transaction, Ziggo Group Holding and
certain of its subsidiaries completed the below financing transactions.

     In August 2016, (i) Ziggo Secured Finance B.V. (Ziggo Secured Finance), a special purpose financing entity owned 100%
by a third-party, entered into a €2,598.2 million ($2,740.4 million) term loan facility (Ziggo Facility C) and (ii) Ziggo Secured
Finance Partnership, a subsidiary of Ziggo Secured Finance, entered into a $1,000.0 million term loan facility (Ziggo Facility D).
Ziggo Facility C and Ziggo Facility D were each issued at 99.5% of par and mature on August 31, 2024. Ziggo Facility C bears
interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 3.75% and is subject to a EURIBOR floor of 0.0%. Ziggo Facility D bears interest at a rate of
LIBOR plus 3.00% and is subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.0%. The net proceeds from Ziggo Facility C were used, in conjunction
with existing cash, to prepay in full (a) the €664.2 million ($700.6 million) outstanding principal amount under an existing Ziggo
Group Holding credit facility that was due on March 31, 2021 and (b) the €1,925.0 million ($2,030.4 million) outstanding principal
amount under the Ziggo Euro Facility, and the net proceeds from Ziggo Facility D were used, in conjunction with existing cash,
to prepay $1,000.0 million of the $2,350.0 million outstanding principal amount under the Ziggo Dollar Facility, which bears
interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% and matures on January 15, 2022. Except as noted above, these transactions were completed
as non-cash refinancings. In connection with these transactions, Ziggo Group Holding recognized losses on debt modification and
extinguishment, net, of $15.9 million. These losses include (1) the the write-off of net unamortized discounts of $8.7 million and
(2) the write-off of $7.2 million of deferred financing costs.

     In September 2016, (i) Ziggo Secured Finance issued (a) $2,000.0 million principal amount of 5.50% senior secured notes
(the Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes) and (b) €775.0 million ($817.4 million) of 4.25% senior secured notes (together
with the Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes, the Ziggo 2027 Senior Secured Notes), each due January 15, 2027, and (ii)

                                                                                             II-168

Ziggo Bond Finance B.V., a special purpose finance entity owned 100% by a third party, issued $625.0 million principal amount
of 6.00% senior notes due January 15, 2027 (the Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes). Ziggo Secured Finance used $300.0 million of the
net proceeds from the Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes to fund a senior secured proceeds loan (the Ziggo Dollar Senior
Secured Proceeds Loans) under a term loan facility agreement. The Ziggo Dollar Senior Secured Proceeds Loans were used to
prepay $300.0 million of the principal amount outstanding under the Ziggo Dollar Facility.

     The remaining net proceeds from the Ziggo 2027 Senior Secured Notes and the Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes were placed into
certain escrow accounts (the Escrowed Proceeds). Upon completion of the Dutch JV Transaction, on January 4, 2017, the Escrowed
Proceeds were used to fund a distribution to Liberty Global and Vodafone. As a result of the Dutch JV Transaction, effective
December 31, 2016, we no longer consolidate Ziggo Group Holding. For information regarding the Dutch JV Transaction and
cash proceeds received on January 4, 2017, see note 5.

(a)     The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 20.0% for 2016 and 2015 and 21.0% for 2014.

(b)     Country jurisdictions giving rise to income tax benefits are grouped together and shown separately from country jurisdictions
        giving rise to income tax expenses.

(c)     During 2015, the U.K. enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of 20.0% to
        19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020. Substantially all of the impact of these rate changes on our deferred tax
        balances was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the change in law was enacted. During the third quarter of 2016,
        the U.K. enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from 18.0% to 17.0%.
        Substantially all of the impact of this rate change on our deferred tax balances was recorded during the third quarter of
        2016.

(d)     Amounts reflect adjustments (either a benefit or expense) to the “expected” tax benefit (expense) for statutory rates in
        jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the U.K.

     Our deferred income tax valuation allowance decreased $380.2 million in 2016. This decrease reflects the net effect of (i)
business acquisitions, (ii) the net tax benefit related to our continuing operations of $888.7 million, including a tax benefit of $1.1
billion recognized in the Netherlands upon the release of valuation allowances in the fourth quarter of 2016, (iii) foreign currency
translation adjustments, (iv) the effect of enacted tax law and rate changes and (v) other individually insignificant items. The
release of valuation allowances in the Netherlands is attributable to a significant improvement in our forecast of taxable income
in the Netherlands, due to, among other factors, the impact of contributing Ziggo Group Holding to the Dutch JV on December
31, 2016, as further described in note 5.

     Virgin Media had property and equipment on which future U.K. tax deductions can be claimed of $17.9 billion and $21.0

capital allowances over the related financial reporting bases are included in the 2016 and 2015 deferred tax assets related to property
and equipment, net, in the above table.

     At December 31, 2016, our unrecognized excess tax benefits aggregated $139.0 million. These excess tax benefits, which
represent tax deductions in excess of the financial reporting expense for share-based compensation, have not been recognized for
financial reporting purposes as these tax benefits have not been realized as a reduction of income taxes payable. The tax effects
of these unrecognized excess tax benefits are not included in the above table. For additional information regarding the adoption
of ASU 2016-09, which will impact the accounting for unrecognized excess tax benefits beginning January 1, 2017, see note 2.

     Our tax loss carryforwards within each jurisdiction combine all companies’ tax losses (both capital and ordinary losses) in
that jurisdiction, however, certain tax jurisdictions limit the ability to offset taxable income of a separate company or different tax
group with the tax losses associated with another separate company or group. Further, tax jurisdictions restrict the type of taxable
income that the above losses are able to offset. The majority of the tax losses shown in the above table are not expected to be
realized, including certain losses that are limited in use due to change in control or same business tests.

     We have taxable outside basis differences on certain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We intend to indefinitely reinvest
earnings from these non-U.S. operations. At December 31, 2016, income and withholding taxes for which a net deferred tax liability
might otherwise be required have not been provided on an estimated $6.9 billion of cumulative temporary differences (including,
for this purpose, any difference between the aggregate tax basis in stock of a consolidated subsidiary and the corresponding amount
of the subsidiary’s net equity, including cumulative translation adjustments, determined for financial reporting purposes) on non-
U.S. entities. The determination of the additional withholding tax that would arise upon a reversal of these temporary differences
is impractical to estimate as it is subject to offset by available foreign tax credits and subject to certain limitations.

    In general, a U.K. or U.S. corporation may claim a foreign tax credit against its income tax expense for foreign income taxes
paid or accrued. A U.S. corporation may also claim a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued on the earnings of a foreign
corporation paid to the U.S. corporation as a dividend.

     Our ability to claim a foreign tax credit for dividends received from our foreign subsidiaries or foreign taxes paid or accrued
is subject to various significant limitations under U.S. tax laws, including a limited carry back and carry forward period. Some of
our operating companies are located in countries with which the U.K. or U.S. does not have income tax treaties. Because we lack
treaty protection in these countries, we may be subject to high rates of withholding taxes on distributions and other payments from
                                                                                           II-178

these operating companies and may be subject to double taxation on our income. Limitations on the ability to claim a foreign tax
credit, lack of treaty protection in some countries and the inability to offset losses in one jurisdiction against income earned in
another jurisdiction could result in a high effective tax rate on our earnings. Since a significant portion of our revenue is generated
outside of the U.K. and substantially all of our revenue is generated outside the U.S., including in jurisdictions that do not have
tax treaties with the U.K. or U.S., these risks are greater for us than for companies that generate most of their revenue in the U.K.
or U.S. or in jurisdictions that have these treaties.

     Through our subsidiaries, we maintain a presence in many countries. Many of these countries maintain highly complex tax
regimes that differ significantly from the system of income taxation used in the U.K. and the U.S. We have accounted for the effect
of these taxes based on what we believe is reasonably expected to apply to us and our subsidiaries based on tax laws currently in
effect and reasonable interpretations of these laws. Because some jurisdictions do not have systems of taxation that are as well
established as the system of income taxation used in the U.K., U.S. or tax regimes used in other major industrialized countries, it
may be difficult to anticipate how other jurisdictions will tax our and our subsidiaries’ current and future operations.

     We and our subsidiaries file consolidated and standalone income tax returns in various jurisdictions. In the normal course of
business, our income tax filings are subject to review by various taxing authorities. In connection with such reviews, disputes
could arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain income tax rules related to our business in
that tax jurisdiction. Such disputes may result in future tax and interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities. The
ultimate resolution of tax contingencies will take place upon the earlier of (i) the settlement date with the applicable taxing authorities
in either cash or agreement of income tax positions or (ii) the date when the tax authorities are statutorily prohibited from adjusting
the company’s tax computations.

     In general, tax returns filed by our company or our subsidiaries for years prior to 2008 are no longer subject to examination
by tax authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently involved in income tax examinations in various jurisdictions in which
we operate, including Austria (2012 through 2014), Chile (2011 through 2015), the Czech Republic (2013), Germany (2008 through
2014), the Netherlands (2015 through 2016), Panama (2013 through 2015), Poland (2010 and 2013), Trinidad and Tobago (2006
through 2009), the U.S. (2009 through 2011 and 2016) and certain other jurisdictions within the Caribbean and Latin America.
Except as noted below, any adjustments that might arise from the foregoing examinations are not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In the U.S., we have received notices of adjustment from
the Internal Revenue Service with respect to our 2010 and 2009 income tax returns, and have entered into the appeals process with
respect to the 2010 and 2009 matters. In Chile, adjustments received from the tax authorities for the tax years 2011 and 2012 are
in dispute. We have appealed these adjustments to the Chilean tax court. Also in Chile, we recorded an income tax receivable in
connection with the expected utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards upon the completion of a merger transaction
of two indirect subsidiaries of Liberty Global. We are engaged in an ongoing examination by tax authorities in Chile in connection
with this receivable and were notified during the third quarter of 2016 that approximately 48% of our claim has been agreed by
the tax authorities. We intend to pursue the payment of the remaining portion of this receivable through available method. While
we believe that the ultimate resolution of these proposed adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows, no assurance can be given that this will be the case given the amounts involved and
the complex nature of the related issues.

       The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits are summarized below:

       No assurance can be given that any of these tax benefits will be recognized or realized.

    As of December 31, 2016, our unrecognized tax benefits included $438.3 million of tax benefits that would have a favorable
impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by
valuation allowances and other factors.

     During 2017, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of ongoing examinations by tax authorities as well as expiration of
statutes of limitation could result in reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken as of December 31,
2016. Other than the potential impacts of these ongoing examinations and the expected expiration of certain statutes of limitation,
we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2017. No assurance can be given as to the nature
or impact of any changes in our unrecognized tax positions during 2017.

    During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the income tax benefit (expense) of our continuing operations includes net income tax benefit
(expense) of $15.7 million, ($10.3 million) and ($10.9 million), respectively, representing the net benefit (accrual) of interest and
penalties during the period. Our other long-term liabilities include accrued interest and penalties of $50.1 million at December 31,
2016.

     Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding class of our preference shares, the holders of Liberty Global Shares and
LiLAC Shares are entitled to dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors from funds available
therefore. Such dividends may be declared in favor of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares, in equal or unequal amounts, or
only in favor of the Liberty Global Shares or the LiLAC Shares. There are currently no contractual restrictions on our ability to
pay dividends in cash or shares.

     In the event of our liquidation, dissolution and winding up, after payment or provision for payment of our debts and liabilities
and subject to the prior payment in full of any preferential amounts to which our preference shareholders, if any, may be entitled,
the holders of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares will be entitled to receive their proportionate interests, expressed in
liquidation units, in any assets available for distribution to our ordinary shares regardless of whether such assets are then attributed
to the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group. Pursuant to the terms of our Articles of Association, the liquidation units for
each Liberty Global Share and each LiLAC Share are 1 and 0.94893, respectively.

     On January 26, 2014, our board of directors approved a share split in the form of a share dividend (the 2014 Share Dividend),
which constituted a bonus issue under our articles of association and English law, of one Liberty Global Class C ordinary share
on each outstanding Liberty Global Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary share as of the February 14, 2014 record date. The
distribution date for the 2014 Share Dividend was March 3, 2014. All Liberty Global share and per share amounts presented herein
give retrospective effect to the 2014 Share Dividend.

  Share Repurchase Programs

     As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our “Distributable
Reserves.” Distributable Reserves, which are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount, may be created through the earnings
of the U.K. parent company and, among other methods, through a reduction in share premium approved by the English Companies
Court. Based on the amounts set forth in our 2015 U.K. Companies Act Report dated April 25, 2016, which are our most recent
“Relevant Accounts” for the purposes of determining our Distributable Reserves under U.K. law, our Distributable Reserves were
$27.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. This amount does not reflect earnings, share repurchases or other activity that occurred in
2016, each of which impacts the amount of our Distributable Reserves.

   Our board of directors has approved share repurchase programs for our Liberty Global Shares and, effective November 2016,
our LiLAC Shares. Under these plans, we receive authorization to acquire up to the specified amount (before direct acquisition
costs) of Class A and Class C Liberty Global Shares or LiLAC Shares, or other authorized securities, from time to time through
open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include derivative transactions. The most recent authorizations provide
for the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion and $300.0 million of Liberty Global and LiLAC Class A and/or Class C shares, respectively.
The timing of the repurchase of shares or other securities pursuant to our equity repurchase programs, which may be suspended
or discontinued at any time, is dependent on a variety of factors, including market conditions. As of December 31, 2016, the
remaining amount authorized for repurchases of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares was $1,943.4 million and $278.6 million,
respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our board of directors increased the amount authorized under the share repurchase
program for our Liberty Global Shares by $1.0 billion.

        Global Shares from July 1 through December 31, 2015.

(c)     Amounts relate to repurchases of Old Liberty Global Shares.

  Call Option Contracts

     From time to time, we enter into call option contracts pursuant to which we contemporaneously (i) sell call options on shares
of Liberty Global ordinary shares and (ii) purchase call options on an equivalent number of Liberty Global ordinary shares with
an exercise price of zero. These contracts can result in the receipt of cash or Liberty Global ordinary shares. Shares acquired
through the exercise of the call options are included in our share repurchases and the net gain on cash settled contracts is recorded
as an increase to additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of equity.

  LiLAC Distribution

      For information regarding the LiLAC Distribution, see note 4.

  Acquisition of Interests in VTR and VTR Wireless

     On March 14, 2014, a subsidiary of VTR Finance acquired each of the noncontrolling ownership interests in VTR and VTR
Wireless SpA (VTR Wireless) from Inversiones Corp Comm 2 SpA (the VTR NCI Acquisition), formerly known as Corp Comm
S.A. (the VTR NCI Owner). VTR Wireless was an indirect subsidiary of Liberty Global that was merged with a subsidiary of
VTR in December 2014. The consideration for the VTR NCI Acquisition was satisfied by the allotment and issuance of 10,091,178
Old Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares to the VTR NCI Owner. The VTR NCI Acquisition has been accounted for as an equity
transaction, the net effect of which was to record the issued Old Liberty Global Class C shares at the $185.4 million carrying value
of the acquired noncontrolling interests.

  Subsidiary Distributions

     From time to time, Telenet, VTR, CWC and certain other of our subsidiaries make cash distributions to their respective
shareholders. Our share of these distributions is eliminated in consolidation and the noncontrolling interest owners’ share of these
distributions is reflected as a charge against noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of equity.

  Restricted Net Assets

     The ability of certain of our subsidiaries to distribute or loan all or a portion of their net assets to our company is limited by
the terms of applicable debt facilities. At December 31, 2016, substantially all of our net assets represented net assets of our
subsidiaries that were subject to such limitations.

(13)        Share-based Compensation

    Our share-based compensation expense primarily relates to the share-based incentive awards issued by Liberty Global to its
employees and employees of its subsidiaries. A summary of the aggregate share-based compensation expense that is included in
our other operating and SG&A expenses is set forth below:

_______________

(a)      Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i) Liberty Global PSUs, including amounts resulting from the 2016
         PSUs, as described and defined below, (ii) a challenge performance award plan for certain executive officers and key
         employees (the Challenge Performance Awards) and (iii) PGUs to our Chief Executive Officer, as described below. The
         Challenge Performance Awards include PSARs and PSUs.

(b)      In connection with the LiLAC Transaction, our compensation committee approved modifications to our outstanding share-
         based incentive awards (the 2015 Award Modifications) in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive plans. The
         objective of our compensation committee was to ensure a relatively unchanged intrinsic value of outstanding equity awards
         before and after the bonus issuance of the LiLAC Shares. The mechanism to modify outstanding share-based incentive
         awards, as approved by our compensation committee, utilized the volume-weighted average price of the respective shares
         for the five days prior to and the five days following the bonus issuance (Modification VWAPs). In order to determine if
         any incremental share-based compensation expense should be recorded as a result of the 2015 Award Modifications, we
         were required to measure the changes in the fair values of the then outstanding share-based incentive awards using market
         prices immediately before and immediately after the 2015 Award Modifications. Due to declines in the share prices of our
         Class A and Class C Liberty Global Shares following the bonus issuance, the exercise prices of options, SARs and PSARs
         determined using the Modification VWAPs were lower than the exercise prices that would have resulted if the market prices
         immediately before and after the 2015 Award Modifications had been used. Accordingly, the Black-Scholes fair values of

                                                                                          II-184

                                            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

        our options, SARs and PSARs increased as a result of the 2015 Award Modifications, resulting in incremental share-based
        compensation of $99.3 million, including $16.1 million and $69.3 million recognized during 2016 and 2015, respectively,
        and $13.9 million that will be recognized in future periods through 2019 as the related awards vest.

(c)     Represents the share-based compensation expense associated with Telenet’s share-based incentive awards, which, at
        December 31, 2016, included (i) warrants and employee stock options (2,473,404 awards outstanding at a weighted average
        exercise price of €43.70 ($46.09)), (ii) performance-based specific stock option plans for the Chief Executive Officer
        (745,000 awards outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of €40.60 ($42.82)), (iii) performance-based share awards
        (173,640 awards outstanding) and (iv) performance-based specific stock option plans for employees (18,750 awards
        outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of €48.83 ($51.50)).

     As of December 31, 2016, $450.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our Liberty Global share-based
compensation awards is expected to be recognized as an expense by our company in the future over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.5 years.

  Share Incentive Plans — Liberty Global Ordinary Shares

  Incentive Plans

     As of December 31, 2016, we are authorized to grant incentive awards under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan and the
Liberty Global 2014 Nonemployee Director Incentive Plan. Generally, we may grant non-qualified share options, SARs, restricted
shares, RSUs, cash awards, performance awards or any combination of the foregoing under either of these incentive plans
(collectively, awards). Ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards made under these incentive plans will be made available from
either authorized but unissued shares or shares that have been issued but reacquired by our company. Awards may be granted at

Plan is 105 million (of which no more than 50.25 million shares may consist of Class B ordinary shares) and 10.5 million,
respectively, in each case, subject to anti-dilution and other adjustment provisions in the respective plan. As of December 31, 2016,

and expire seven years after the grant date. RSUs vest on the date of the first annual general meeting of shareholders following
the grant date. These awards may be granted at or above fair value in any class of ordinary shares.

Global 2005 Director Incentive Plan or the VM Incentive Plan.

  Performance Awards

    The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions with respect to our performance-based awards for certain
executive officers and key employees.

    Liberty Global PSUs

      Equity awards are granted to executive officers and key employees based on a target annual equity value for each executive
and key employee, of which approximately two-thirds would be delivered in the form of PSUs and approximately one-third in
the form of an annual award of SARs. Each currently-outstanding PSU represents the right to receive one Liberty Global or LiLAC
Class A or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, subject to performance and vesting. Although PSUs are generally granted on an
annual basis, no PSUs will be granted in 2017 to recipients of the 2016 PSUs, as defined and described below.

     In March 2015, our compensation committee approved the grant of PSUs to executive officers and key employees (the 2015
PSUs). The performance plan for the 2015 PSUs covered a two-year period ending December 31, 2016 and included a performance
target based on the achievement of a specified compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in a consolidated Adjusted OIBDA metric
(as defined in note 18). The performance target was adjusted for events such as acquisitions, dispositions and changes in foreign
currency exchange rates that affect comparability (Adjusted OIBDA CAGR), and the participant’s annual performance ratings
during the two-year performance period. A performance range of 75% to 125% of the target Adjusted OIBDA CAGR will result
in award recipients earning 50% to 150% of their respective PSUs, subject to reduction or forfeiture based on individual
performance. The percentage of the 2015 PSUs that has been earned by participants has not been finalized. The 2015 PSUs will
vest 50% on each of April 1 and October 1 of 2017.

     In February 2016, our compensation committee approved the grant of PSUs to executive officers and key employees (the
2016 PSUs) pursuant to a performance plan that is based on the achievement of a specified Adjusted OIBDA CAGR during the
three-year period ended December 31, 2018. The 2016 PSUs require delivery of a compound annual growth rate of our consolidated
Adjusted OIBDA CAGR of 6.0% during the three-year performance period, with over- and under-performance payout opportunities
should the Adjusted OIBDA CAGR exceed or fail to meet the target, as applicable. The performance payout may be adjusted at
the compensation committee’s discretion for events that may affect comparability, such as changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and accounting principles or policies. A performance range of 75% to 167.5% of the target Adjusted OIBDA CAGR will
generally result in award recipients earning 75% to 300% of their target 2016 PSUs, subject to reduction or forfeiture based on
individual performance. The earned 2016 PSUs will vest 50% on each of April 1, 2019 and October 1, 2019.



                                                               II-186

                                               Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                           December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


     Liberty Global Performance Grant Award

     Effective April 30, 2014, our compensation committee authorized the grant of PGUs to our Chief Executive Officer, comprising
a total of one million PGUs with respect to Class A Old Liberty Global Shares and one million PGUs with respect to Class B Old
Liberty Global Shares. The PGUs, which were subject to a performance condition that was achieved in 2014, vest in three equal
annual installments, the first of which occurred on March 15, 2015. Our Chief Executive Officer also received 41,589 PGUs with
respect to each Class A and Class B LiLAC Shares as a result of the LiLAC Distribution in 2016 and 33,333 PGUs with respect
to each Class A and Class B LiLAC Shares as a result of the LiLAC Transaction in 2015. Each of these additional distributions
vest over the same period as the May 1, 2014 award grant described above.

     Liberty Global Challenge Performance Awards

     Effective June 24, 2013, our compensation committee approved the Challenge Performance Awards, which consisted solely
of PSARs for our senior executive officers and a combination of PSARs and PSUs for our other executive officers and key
employees. Each PSU represented the right to receive one Liberty Global or LiLAC Class A or Class C ordinary share, as
applicable. The performance criteria for the Challenge Performance Awards was based on the participant’s performance and
achievement of individual goals in each of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. As a result of satisfying performance conditions, 100%
of the then outstanding Challenge Performance Awards vested and became fully exercisable on June 24, 2016. The PSARs have
a term of seven years and base prices equal to the respective market closing prices of the applicable class on the grant date.

  LiLAC Distribution

     In connection with the LiLAC Distribution, our compensation committee approved modifications to our outstanding share-
based incentive awards (the 2016 Award Modification) in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive plans. The
objective of our compensation committee was to ensure a relatively unchanged intrinsic value of outstanding equity awards before
and after the LiLAC Distribution. The mechanism to modify outstanding share-based incentive awards, as approved by our
compensation committee, utilized an analysis of the prices of the respective shares before and after the share issuance. Based upon
this approach, we determined the incremental value associated with the 2016 Award Modification was immaterial. As a result, we
did not recognize any incremental share-based compensation expense associated with the 2016 Award Modification. The impact
of the LiLAC Distribution is separately presented in the below tables.

     Our restructuring charges during 2016 included employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization
and integration activities of $59.3 million in Germany, $26.1 million in U.K./Ireland, $20.4 million in the European Division’s
central operations, $11.6 million in Chile and $10.8 million in the Netherlands. Our restructuring charges during 2016 also included
contract termination and other costs related to (i) contract termination charges of $15.0 million included in the European Division’s
central operations, $7.7 million in the corporate and other category and $5.5 million in Chile and (ii) a charge of $11.6 million
resulting from the write-off by Liberty Puerto Rico of a prepaid indefeasible right of use for telecommunications capacity due to
the abandonment of this capacity in favor of capacity on CWC’s network.

     Prior to March 31, 2014, Telenet operated a DTT business that served a limited number of subscribers. The DTT network was
accessed by Telenet pursuant to third-party capacity contracts that were accounted for as operating agreements. On March 31,
2014, Telenet discontinued the provision of DTT services and, accordingly, recorded an $86.1 million restructuring charge during
the three months ended March 31, 2014. This charge was equal to the then fair value of the remaining payments due under the
DTT capacity contracts.

    Our restructuring charges during 2014 also included $17.5 million, $11.2 million, $10.7 million, $10.1 million and $9.8 million
of employee severance and termination costs related to reorganization and integration activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the
Netherlands, Germany, Chile and the European Division’s central operations, respectively.

(15)        Defined Benefit Plans

     Certain of our subsidiaries maintain various funded and unfunded defined benefit plans for their employees. A significant
portion of these defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants and existing participants do not accrue any additional benefits.

       The table below provides summary information on our defined benefit plans:

                                                                                                                                          Year ended December 31,

Projected benefit obligation........................................................................................... $             3,200.3   $   1,188.3   $   1,247.6
Fair value of plan assets (a) ........................................................................................... $           3,108.7   $   1,092.6   $   1,122.7

_______________

(a)      The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2016 includes $1,707.4 million, $199.1 million and $1,202.2 million of assets
         that are valued based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, respectively, of the fair value hierarchy (as further described
         in note 8). Our plan assets comprise investments in debt securities, equity securities, hedge funds, insurance contracts and
         certain other assets (including $1,018.3 million of investments valued using Level 3 inputs that are held by the CWSF, as
         defined and described below).
(b)      The 2016 and 2015 amounts exclude aggregate curtailment gains of $1.4 million and $7.9 million, respectively, which are
         included in impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.

     At December 31, 2016, the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund (the CWSF), which is CWC’s largest defined benefit
plan, had (i) a projected benefit obligation of $1,675.7 million, (ii) fair value of plan assets of $1,666.0 million and (iii) a funded
status deficit of $9.7 million. During the period from April 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, CWC made cash contributions
to the CWSF of $44.3 million (including $1.1 million of contributions made subsequent to the completion of the CWC Acquisition),
which was based in part on the triennial actuarial funding valuation as of March 31, 2013. CWC’s acquisition of Columbus
constituted a “change of control” under the contingent funding agreement (the Contingent Funding Agreement) between CWC
and the trustee of the CWSF and, therefore, the trustee of the CWSF has the right to drawdown on the $123.5 million letters of
credit that were put in place in connection with the acquisition of Columbus pursuant to the terms of the Contingent Funding
Agreement. Based on the pending outcome of the triennial actuarial valuation as of March 31, 2016, which is expected to be
completed during the second quarter of 2017, CWC’s contributions necessary to fund the CWSF by April 2019 are currently
expected to range from nil to $28.4 million per year during 2017, 2018 and 2019. CWC is currently in negotiations with the trustee
of the CWSF with respect to the future funding requirements of the CWSF and the outstanding letters of credit with a view to
addressing the remaining deficit through future contributions over a period of time similar in structure to prior triennial period
contribution schedules. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of such negotiations.

    Based on December 31, 2016 exchange rates and information available as of that date, our subsidiaries’ contributions to their
respective defined benefit plans in 2017 are expected to aggregate $88.2 million, including $29.6 million attributable to the CWSF.

(17)      Commitments and Contingencies

  Commitments

     In the normal course of business, we have entered into agreements that commit our company to make cash payments in future
periods with respect to network and connectivity commitments, programming contracts, purchases of customer premises and other
equipment and services, non-cancellable operating leases and other items. The following table sets forth the U.S. dollar equivalents
of such commitments as of December 31, 2016:
                                                                                Payments due during:

   Total (a) ....................................... $ 3,197.1   $ 1,628.2     $ 1,018.2   $    625.8    $    391.8   $ 1,295.0    $ 8,156.1
_______________

(a)    The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our December 31, 2016 consolidated
       balance sheet.

     Network and connectivity commitments include (i) Telenet’s commitments for certain operating costs associated with its
leased network, (ii) commitments associated with our MVNO agreements and (iii) service commitments associated with our
network extension projects, primarily in the U.K. Telenet’s commitments for certain operating costs are subject to adjustment
based on changes in the network operating costs incurred by Telenet with respect to its own networks. These potential adjustments
are not subject to reasonable estimation and, therefore, are not included in the above table. The amounts reflected in the above
table with respect to certain of our MVNO commitments represent fixed minimum amounts payable under these agreements and,
therefore, may be significantly less than the actual amounts we ultimately pay in these periods.

     Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming, studio output and sports rights
contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual
number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose
of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. In addition, programming
commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are
not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the
amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented
a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods. In this regard,
our total programming and copyright costs aggregated $2,449.4 million (including $2,104.5 million for the Liberty Global Group
and $344.9 million for the LiLAC Group), $2,313.9 million (including $2,066.6 million for the Liberty Global Group and $247.3
million for the LiLAC Group) and $2,160.0 million (including $1,928.0 million for the Liberty Global Group and $232.0 million
for the LiLAC Group) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.



                                                                            II-201
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


    Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) the purchase of customer premises
and other equipment and (ii) certain service-related commitments, including call center, information technology and maintenance
services.
    Commitments arising from acquisition agreements are not reflected in the above table. For information regarding our
commitments under acquisition agreements, see note 4.

     In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments
and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For
information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, see note 7. For information regarding our defined benefit plans, see note 15.

     We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities and municipalities,
which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts or to upgrade, rebuild or extend
portions of our broadband communication systems. Such amounts are not included in the above table because they are not fixed
or determinable.

     Rental expense under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements amounted to $250.6 million (including $205.2 million
for the Liberty Global Group and $45.4 million for the LiLAC Group), $219.0 million (including $204.7 million for the Liberty
Global Group and $14.3 million for the LiLAC Group) and $268.3 million (including $252.0 million for the Liberty Global Group
and $16.3 million for the LiLAC Group) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. It is expected that in the normal course of
business, operating leases that expire generally will be renewed or replaced by similar leases.

     We have established various defined contribution benefit plans for our and our subsidiaries’ employees. Our aggregate expense
for matching contributions under the various defined contribution employee benefit plans was $76.8 million (including $70.4
million for the Liberty Global Group and $6.4 million for the LiLAC Group), $76.7 million (including $75.0 million for the Liberty
Global Group and $1.7 million for the LiLAC Group) and $63.2 million (including $61.7 million for the Liberty Global Group
and $1.5 million for the LiLAC Group) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

  Guarantees and Other Credit Enhancements

     In the ordinary course of business, we may provide (i) indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain other parties
and (ii) performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors. Historically, these arrangements
have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments
in the future.

  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies

     Interkabel Acquisition. On November 26, 2007, Telenet and the PICs announced a non-binding agreement-in-principle to
transfer the analog and digital television activities of the PICs, including all existing subscribers to Telenet. Subsequently, Telenet
and the PICs entered into a binding agreement (the 2008 PICs Agreement), which closed effective October 1, 2008. Beginning
in December 2007, Proximus NV/SA (Proximus), the incumbent telecommunications operator in Belgium, instituted several
proceedings seeking to block implementation of these agreements. Proximus lodged summary proceedings with the President of
the Court of First Instance of Antwerp to obtain a provisional injunction preventing the PICs from effecting the agreement-in-
principle and initiated a civil procedure on the merits claiming the annulment of the agreement-in-principle. In March 2008, the
President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of Proximus in the summary proceedings, which ruling was
overturned by the Court of Appeal of Antwerp in June 2008. Proximus brought this appeal judgment before the Cour de Cassation
(the Belgian Supreme Court), which confirmed the appeal judgment in September 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Court of First
Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of the PICs and Telenet in the civil procedure on the merits, dismissing Proximus’s request for
the rescission of the agreement-in-principle and the 2008 PICs Agreement. On June 12, 2009, Proximus appealed this judgment
with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. In this appeal, Proximus is now also seeking compensation for damages should the 2008
PICs Agreement not be rescinded. While these proceedings were suspended indefinitely, other proceedings were initiated, which
resulted in a ruling by the Belgian Council of State in May 2014 annulling (i) the decision of the PICs not to organize a public
market consultation and (ii) the decision from the PICs’ board of directors to approve the 2008 PICs Agreement. In December
2015, Proximus resumed the civil proceedings pending with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp seeking to have the 2008 PICs
Agreement annulled and claiming damages of €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion).

                                                                II-202

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


     Telenet intends to defend itself vigorously in the resumed proceedings and does not expect an outcome before the end of 2017.
No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these or other proceedings. However, an unfavorable outcome of existing or future
proceedings could potentially lead to the annulment of the 2008 PICs Agreement and/or to an obligation of Telenet to pay
compensation for damages, subject to the relevant provisions of the 2008 PICs Agreement, which stipulate that Telenet is responsible
for damages in excess of €20.0 million ($21.1 million). We do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material
impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. No amounts have been accrued by us with respect to this
matter as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable.

     Deutsche Telekom Litigation. On December 28, 2012, Unitymedia filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Telekom in which
Unitymedia asserts that it pays excessive prices for the co-use of Deutsche Telekom’s cable ducts in Unitymedia’s footprint. The
Federal Network Agency approved rates for the co-use of certain ducts of Deutsche Telekom in March 2011. Based in part on
these approved rates, Unitymedia is seeking a reduction of the annual lease fees (approximately €76 million ($80 million) for
2012) by approximately two-thirds and the return of similarly calculated overpayments from 2009 through the ultimate settlement
date, plus accrued interest. In October 2016, the first instance court dismissed this action. We have appealed this decision, however,
the resolution of this matter may take several years and no assurance can be given that Unitymedia’s claims will be successful.
Any recovery by Unitymedia will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition
of this matter has been reached.

      Liberty Puerto Rico Matter. In November 2012, we completed a business combination that resulted in, among other matters,
the combination of our then operating subsidiary in Puerto Rico with San Juan Cable, LLC dba OneLink Communications
(OneLink). In connection with this transaction (the OneLink Acquisition), Liberty Puerto Rico, as the surviving entity, became
a party to certain claims previously asserted by the incumbent telephone operator (PRTC) against OneLink based on alleged
conduct of OneLink that occurred prior to the OneLink Acquisition (the PRTC Claim). The PRTC Claim includes an allegation
that OneLink acted in an anticompetitive manner in connection with a series of legal and regulatory proceedings it initiated against
PRTC in Puerto Rico beginning in 2009. In March 2014, a separate class action claim was filed in Puerto Rico (the Class Action
Claim) containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted in the PRTC Claim, but alleging ongoing injury on behalf of
a consumer class (as opposed to harm to a competitor). In July 2016, the judge presiding over the PRTC Claim in the United States
District Court for the District of Maine (the District Court) granted OneLink summary judgment that dismissed the PRTC Claim
in its entirety. PRTC filed an appeal of the District Court’s decision with the United States First Circuit Court of Appeals. Based
on our assessment of the PRTC Claim on appeal and the Class Action Claim, we have determined that the possibility of loss is
remote. As a result, we will not report on this matter in future filings. In connection with the July 2016 decision, we have released
our previously-recorded provision and related indemnification asset associated with the PRTC Claim, resulting in a $5.1 million
reduction to our SG&A expenses during the third quarter of 2016. In December 2016, we received $7.5 million related to the
reimbursement of legal fees we incurred in connection with the PRTC Claim, resulting in a reduction to our SG&A expenses
during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the release of the former owners of OneLink from their obligations under the indemnification
agreement entered into in connection with the OneLink Acquisition.

     Belgium Regulatory Developments. In December 2010, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicatie and the regional
regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) published their respective draft decisions
reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium.

     The Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the July 2011 Decision) with some minor
revisions. The regulatory obligations imposed by the July 2011 Decision include (i) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail
minus’’ of the cable analog package available to third party operators (including Proximus), (ii) an obligation to grant third-party
operators (except Proximus) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at “retail minus,”
and (iii) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital
television access obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except
Proximus).

     In February 2012, Telenet submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above, and the Belgium
Regulatory Authorities published the final decision on September 9, 2013. Telenet has implemented the access obligations as
described in its reference offers and, on March 1, 2016, Orange Belgium NV (Orange Belgium), formerly known as Mobistar
SA, launched a commercial offer combining a cable TV package and broadband internet access for certain of their mobile customers.
In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014,
Proximus submitted a request to Telenet to commence access negotiations. Telenet contests this request and has asked the Belgium

                                                                II-203

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


Regulatory Authorities to assess the reasonableness of the Proximus request. The timing for a decision regarding this assessment
by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities is not known.

     On December 14, 2015, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft decision, which amended previously-issued
decisions and sets forth the “retail minus” tariffs of minus 26% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and
minus 18% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services during an initial two-year period. Following this
two-year period, the tariffs would change to minus 15% and 7%, respectively. The draft decision was notified to the European
Commission and a final decision was adopted on February 19, 2016. A “retail minus” method of pricing involves a wholesale
tariff calculated as the retail price for the offered service by Telenet, excluding VAT and copyrights, and further deducting the
retail costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing and sales).

     Telenet filed an appeal against the July 2011 Decision with the Brussels Court of Appeal. On November 12, 2014, the Brussels
Court of Appeal rejected Telenet’s appeal of the July 2011 Decision and accepted Proximus’s claim that Proximus should be
allowed access to Telenet’s, among other operators, digital television platform and the resale of bundles of digital video and
broadband internet services. On November 30, 2015, Telenet filed an appeal of this decision with the Belgian Supreme Court. In
2014, Telenet and wireless operator Orange Belgium each filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the initial
retail minus decisions. These appeals are still pending. On April 25, 2016, Telenet also filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of
Appeal challenging the February 19, 2016 retail minus decision. There can be no certainty that Telenet’s appeals will be successful.

     The July 2011 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access
to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in
developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (i) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet
to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (ii) adversely impact Telenet’s ability
to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the
extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to Telenet’s network and other competitive factors
or market developments.

     Financial Transactions Tax. Certain countries in the European Union (E.U.), including Germany, Austria and Slovakia, are
participating in an enhanced cooperation procedure to introduce a financial transactions tax (the FTT). Under the draft language
of the FTT proposal, a wide range of financial transactions could be taxed at rates of at least 0.01% for derivative transactions
based on the notional amount and 0.1% for other covered financial transactions based on the underlying transaction price. Each
of the individual countries would be permitted to determine an exact rate, which could be higher than the proposed rates of 0.01%
and 0.1%. Any implementation of the FTT could have a global impact because it would apply to all financial transactions where
a financial institution is involved (including unregulated entities that engage in certain types of covered activity) and either of the
parties (whether the financial institution or its counterparty) is in one of the participating countries. Although there continues to
be ongoing discussions in the relevant countries around the FTT, uncertainty remains as to if and when the FTT will be implemented
and the breadth of its application. Based on our understanding of the current status of the potential FTT, we do not expect that any
implementation of the FTT would occur before 2018. Any imposition of the FTT could increase banking fees and introduce taxes
on internal transactions that we currently perform. Due to the uncertainty regarding the FTT, we are currently unable to estimate
the financial impact that the FTT could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

     Virgin Media VAT Matters. Virgin Media’s application of VAT with respect to certain revenue generating activities has been
challenged by the U.K. tax authorities. Virgin Media has estimated its maximum exposure in the event of an unfavorable outcome
to be £46.6 million ($57.5 million) as of December 31, 2016. No portion of this exposure has been accrued by Virgin Media as
the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. A court hearing was held at the end of September 2014 in relation to the
U.K. tax authorities’ challenge and the timing of the court’s decision is uncertain.

     On March 19, 2014, the U.K. government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection
with prompt payment discounts such as those that we offer to our fixed-line telephony customers. This change, which took effect
on May 1, 2014, impacted our company and some of our competitors. The U.K. tax authority issued a decision in the fourth quarter
of 2015 challenging our application of the prompt payment discount rules prior to the May 1, 2014 change in legislation. We have
appealed this decision. As part of the appeal process, we were required to make aggregate payments of £67.0 million ($99.1 million
at the respective transaction dates), which included the challenged amount of £63.7 million and related interest of £3.3 million.
The aggregate amount paid does not include penalties, which could be significant in the unlikely event that penalties were to be
assessed. This matter will likely be subject to court proceedings that could delay the ultimate resolution for an extended period of

                                                                II-204

time. No portion of this potential exposure has been accrued by our company as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be
probable.

     Hungary VAT Matter. In February 2016, our DTH operations in Luxembourg received a second instance decision from the
Hungarian tax authorities as a result of an audit with respect to VAT payments that the Hungarian tax authorities conducted for
the years 2010 through 2012. The Hungarian tax authorities assessed our DTH operations with an obligation to pay VAT for the
years audited of HUF 5,413.2 million ($18.5 million), excluding interest and penalties, which could be significant. We believe
that our DTH operations have operated in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and interpretations thereof, including
a binding tax ruling that we received from the Hungarian government in 2010. In October 2016, a Budapest court disagreed with
the tax authorities and dismissed the assessment. On February 2, 2017, the Hungarian tax authorities appealed the Budapest court
decision to the Hungarian Supreme Court. No portion of this exposure has been accrued by us as the likelihood of loss is not
considered to be probable.

     Other Regulatory Issues. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are
regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some
significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the E.U. Adverse regulatory
developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition
or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types
of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may
restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other
access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with
current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

     We have been notified of a fourfold increase in the rateable value of our network and other assets in the U.K. that is scheduled
to become effective on April 1, 2017. This increase will affect the amount we pay for network infrastructure charges as the annual
amount payable to the U.K. government is calculated by applying a percentage multiplier to the rateable value of assets. This
proposed change, together with a similar proposed change in Ireland, would result in significant increases in our network
infrastructure charges. We estimate that the aggregate amount of these increases will be approximately £30 million ($37 million)
during 2017 and will build to a maximum aggregate increase of up to £120 million ($148 million) in 2021. We believe that the
proposed increases are excessive, and we will challenge the underlying methodology and assumptions.

     In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business
including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving VAT and wage, property, withholding and other tax issues and (iii) disputes
over interconnection, programming, copyright and channel carriage fees. While we generally expect that the amounts required to
satisfy these contingencies will not materially differ from any estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that
the resolution of one or more of these contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial position in any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack
of a clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows that might
result from any unfavorable outcomes.

(18)     Segment Reporting

     We generally identify our reportable segments as those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more of our revenue,
Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets. In certain cases, we may elect to include an operating segment in our segment
disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions
about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. In
addition, we review non-financial measures such as subscriber growth, as appropriate.

     Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA) is the primary measure used by our
chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance. Adjusted OIBDA is also a key factor that is used by
our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our
management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, Adjusted OIBDA is defined as
operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to
significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains and losses
on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and

                                                               II-205

                                             December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014


dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains
and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted OIBDA is a meaningful
measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure
and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between
segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. A
reconciliation of total segment Adjusted OIBDA to our earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes is presented
below.

    As of December 31, 2016, our reportable segments are as follows:

    •    European Division:
           •    U.K./Ireland
           •    Belgium
           •    The Netherlands (through the completion of the Dutch JV Transaction)
           •    Germany
           •    Switzerland/Austria
           •    Central and Eastern Europe

    •    LiLAC Division:
           •    CWC
           •    Chile
           •    Puerto Rico

    On December 31, 2016, we completed the Dutch JV Transaction, whereby we contributed Ziggo Group Holding (including
Ziggo Sport) to the Dutch JV. Accordingly, our results of operations include the operations of Ziggo Group Holding and Ziggo
Sport for all periods presented while our December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet excludes such entities. In our segment
presentation, Ziggo Group Holding (exclusive of Ziggo Sport, which became a subsidiary of Ziggo Group Holding in October
2016) is separately reported as “The Netherlands” and Ziggo Sport is included in our “Corporate and Other” category. Beginning
with the first quarter of 2017, we expect to present the Dutch JV as a reportable segment. For additional information regarding
the Dutch JV Transaction, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

     All of the reportable segments set forth above derive their revenue primarily from residential and B2B services, including
video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and, with the exception of Puerto Rico, mobile services. At
December 31, 2016, our operations in the European Division provided residential and B2B services in 11 European countries and
DTH services to customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through a Luxembourg-based organization
that we refer to as “UPC DTH.” In addition to UPC DTH, our Central and Eastern Europe segment includes our broadband
communications operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. The European Division’s central and
other category includes (i) costs associated with certain centralized functions, including billing systems, network operations,
technology, marketing, facilities, finance and other administrative functions, and (ii) intersegment eliminations within the European
Division. In addition, our LiLAC Division provides residential and B2B services in (a) 18 countries, all but one of which are
located in Latin America and the Caribbean, through CWC, (b) Chile through VTR and (c) Puerto Rico through Liberty Puerto
Rico. CWC also provides (1) B2B services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (2) wholesale services
over its sub-sea and terrestrial networks that connect over 30 markets in that region. The corporate and other category for the
Liberty Global Group includes less significant consolidated operating segments that provide programming and other services,
including Ziggo Sport through December 31, 2016. Intersegment eliminations primarily represent the elimination of intercompany
transactions between our broadband communications and programming operations. Inter-group eliminations represent the
elimination of intercompany transactions between the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group.

  Performance Measures of Our Reportable Segments

     The amounts presented below represent 100% of each of our reportable segment’s revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. As we have
the ability to control Telenet, Liberty Puerto Rico and certain subsidiaries of CWC that are not wholly owned, we consolidate
100% of the revenue and expenses of these entities in our consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that third parties
own significant interests in these entities. The noncontrolling owners’ interests in the operating results of Telenet, Liberty Puerto

_______________

(a)     Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
        fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(b)     Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $313.4 million, $212.7 million and $245.0 million
        during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included
        in other revenue.

(c)     B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium
        to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain small or home office
        (SOHO) subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband
        internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our
        residential subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in subscription revenue, aggregated $491.8
        million, $319.2 million and $216.5 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(d)     Other revenue includes, among other items, interconnect fees, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fees and installation
        fees.

                                            Notes to Attributed Financial Information
                                               December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014
                                                           (unaudited)


(1)    Attributed Financial Information

     The terms “LiLAC Group” and “Liberty Global Group” do not represent separate legal entities, rather they represent those
businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each group. The LiLAC Group comprises our businesses, assets and
liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed to it (i) LGE Coral and its subsidiaries, which include CWC, (ii)
VTR Finance and its subsidiaries, which include VTR, (iii) Lila Chile Holding, which is the parent entity of VTR Finance, (iv)
LiLAC Communications and its subsidiaries, which include Liberty Puerto Rico and (v) prior to July 1, 2015, the LiLAC Corporate
Costs. Effective July 1, 2015, LiLAC Corporate Costs were transferred to LiLAC Communications. The Liberty Global Group
comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities not attributed to the LiLAC Group, including Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding
(through December 31, 2016), Unitymedia, Telenet, UPC Holding, our corporate entities (excluding LiLAC Communications)
and certain other less significant entities. Accordingly, the accompanying attributed financial information for the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group includes the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of the respective entities within
each group. Any business that we may acquire in the future that we do not attribute to the LiLAC Group will be attributed to the
Liberty Global Group.

     Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to either the
Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group to the other group, without the approval of any of our shareholders, and may use the
liquidity of one group to fund the liquidity and capital resource requirements of the other group. Accordingly, shareholders may
have difficulty evaluating the future prospects and liquidity and capital resources of each group.

(2)    Income Taxes

     We generally have accounted for income taxes for the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group in the accompanying
attributed financial information on a separate return basis, as adjusted to reflect the consolidated view of the tax asset, liability,
benefit or expense (tax attribute) of each group. Accordingly, except as otherwise noted below, any tax attribute associated with
an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group has been allocated to the Liberty Global Group and any tax attribute associated
with an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group has been allocated to the LiLAC Group.

     Liberty Global owns consolidated interests in a number of entities that are included in combined or consolidated tax returns,
including tax returns in the Netherlands (the Dutch Fiscal Unity), the U.K. (the U.K. Tax Group) and the U.S. (the U.S. Tax
Group). Different members of the Liberty Global Group file combined tax returns for the Dutch Fiscal Unity and U.K. tax returns,
where sharing of certain tax attributes is permitted, and consolidated tax returns for the U.S. Tax Group. Certain entities included
in the Dutch Fiscal Unity, the U.K. Tax Group and the U.S. Tax Group are attributed to the LiLAC Group. As a result, we record
inter-group tax allocations to recognize changes in the tax attributes of certain members of the LiLAC Group that are included in
the Dutch Fiscal Unity, the U.K. Tax Group or the U.S. Tax Group. Prior to July 1, 2015, the inter-group tax allocations reflected
in the attributed financial information were not cash settled and were not the subject of tax sharing agreements. Accordingly, inter-
group tax allocations prior to July 1, 2015 are reflected in the attributed financial information as adjustments of equity. Following
the adoption of the tax sharing policy described below, certain inter-group tax allocations are expected to be cash settled.

     Effective July 1, 2015 (the date we distributed the LiLAC Shares), the allocation of tax attributes between the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group is based on a tax sharing policy. This tax sharing policy, which may be changed in future periods at
the discretion of the board of directors of Liberty Global, generally results in the allocation of Liberty Global’s tax attributes to
the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group based on the tax attributes of the legal entities attributed to each of the groups.
Nevertheless, to the extent that Liberty Global management concludes the actions or results of one group give rise to changes in
the tax attributes of the other group, the change in those tax attributes are generally allocated to the group whose actions or results
gave rise to such changes. Similarly, in cases where legal entities in one group join in a common tax filing with members of the
other group, changes in the tax attributes of the group that includes the filing entity that are the result of the actions or financial
results of one or more members of the other group are allocated to the group that does not include the filing entity. In addition, the
allocation of any taxes and losses resulting from the ultimate tax treatment of Liberty Global tax attributes related to the distribution
of the LiLAC Shares are allocated in proportion to each group’s respective number of “liquidation units.” Pursuant to the terms
of our articles of association, the liquidation units for each Liberty Global Share and each LiLAC Share are 1 and 0.94893,
respectively. For periods beginning on and after July 1, 2015, we will record non-interest bearing inter-group payables and
receivables in connection with the allocation of tax attributes to the extent that tax assets are utilized or taxable income is included
in the return for the applicable tax year. These inter-group payables and receivables are expected to be cash settled annually within
90 days following the filing of the relevant tax return.

(a)        The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 20.0% for 2016 and 2015 and 21.0% for 2014.

(b)        During 2015, the U.K. enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of 20.0% to
           19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020. Substantially all of the impact of these rate changes on the Liberty Global
           Group’s deferred tax balances was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the change in law was enacted. During the
           third quarter of 2016, the U.K. enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from
           18.0% to 17.0%. Substantially all of the rate impact of this rate change on the Liberty Global Group’s deferred tax balances
           was recorded during the third quarter of 2016.

(c)        Amounts reflect adjustments to the “expected” tax benefit (expense) for statutory rates in jurisdictions in which we operate
           outside of the U.K.

(a)        The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 20.0% for 2016 and 2015 and 21.0% for 2014.

(b)        Amounts reflect adjustments to the “expected” tax benefit (expense) for statutory rates in jurisdictions in which we operate
           outside of the U.K.

(c)        During 2015, the U.K. enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of 20.0% to
           19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020. Substantially all of the impact of these rate changes on the LiLAC Group’s
           deferred tax balances was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the change in law was enacted. During the third
           quarter of 2016, the U.K. enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from 18.0%
           to 17.0%. Substantially all of the rate impact of this rate change on the LiLAC Group’s deferred tax balances was recorded
           during the third quarter of 2016.

        The components of the LiLAC Group’s deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

  Chilean Tax Law Changes

     In September 2014, the Chilean President signed into law an extensive tax reform bill, including changes to the corporate tax
rate, changes to the thin capitalization rules, taxation of certain Chilean investments abroad and changes to the stamp tax rate,
among other relevant changes. The impacts of the tax law changes that are currently in effect are reflected in the attributed financial
information. Accordingly, the corporate tax rate during 2015 of 22.5% increased to 24% during 2016. Beginning in 2017, there
are two income tax regimes: the “attributed system” and the “partially integrated system.” Under the “partially integrated system,”
which the LiLAC Group’s Chilean operations are required to use based on legislation that was enacted on February 1, 2016, the
corporate tax rate will be 25.5% in 2017 and 27% in 2018 and future years, and the 35% withholding tax will be paid only upon
actual distributions to shareholders. However, under this partially integrated system, only 65% of the corporate tax paid by a
Chilean company can be used as a credit against the withholding tax imposed on non-Chilean resident shareholders, which implies
a final tax burden of 44.45%. In the case of shareholders resident in countries that have tax treaties in force with Chile, there will
be a full credit for the corporate tax paid, which implies a final tax burden of 35% for such shareholders. Currently, there are no
tax treaties between Chile and the U.S.

(3)    Allocated Expenses

     Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not allocate any of the costs of the Liberty Global Group’s corporate functions to the LiLAC
Group. Following the July 1, 2015 distribution of the LiLAC Shares, we began to allocate a portion of these costs, excluding share-
based compensation expense, to the LiLAC Group based primarily on the estimated percentage of time spent by corporate personnel
providing services for each group. The allocated costs, which are cash settled and are periodically re-evaluated, are presented as
inter-group fees and allocations in the attributed statements of operations information. The portion of the Liberty Global Group’s
corporate costs that were allocated to the LiLAC Group was $4.3 million and $8.5 million during the six months ended December
31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Effective January 1, 2017, the costs to be allocated to the LiLAC
Group increased to $12.0 million annually.

     The share-based compensation expense reflected in the accompanying attributed statements of operations information is based
on the share incentive awards held by the employees of the respective entities comprising the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC
Group.

    The income tax benefit and expense of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group includes inter-group tax allocations.
For additional information concerning our inter-group tax allocations, see note 2 to this attributed financial information.

     While we believe that our allocation methodologies are reasonable, we may elect to change these allocation methodologies
or the percentages used to allocate operating and SG&A expenses in the future.

(4)    Inter-group Transactions

  Inter-group Interests

    On May 16, 2016, we competed the CWC Acquisition. Under the terms of the transaction, CWC shareholders received in the
aggregate: 31,607,008 Class A Liberty Global Shares, 77,379,774 Class C Liberty Global Shares, 3,648,513 Class A LiLAC Shares
and 8,939,316 Class C LiLAC Shares. Further, in accordance with the scheme of arrangement and immediately prior to the
acquisition, CWC declared the Special Dividend to its shareholders in the amount of £0.03 ($0.04 at the transaction date) per CWC
share. The Special Dividend was paid to CWC shareholders promptly following the closing and the payment, together with fees
and expenses related to the acquisition, was funded with CWC liquidity, including incremental debt borrowings, and LiLAC Group
corporate liquidity.

     Following completion of the CWC Acquisition, we attributed CWC to the LiLAC Group, with the Liberty Global Group being
granted an inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group representing the fair value (as determined by our board of directors) of the
Liberty Global Shares issued as part of the purchase consideration. During the period from May 16, 2016 through June 30, 2016,
we recorded the Liberty Global Group’s 67.5% share of the LiLAC Group’s loss during this period in Liberty Global Group’s
attributed statement of operations information with a corresponding offsetting amount recorded in the LiLAC Group’s attributed
statement of operations information. Liberty Global Group's inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group was $3.9 billion as of June
30, 2016. On July 1, 2016, we completed the LiLAC Distribution, thereby eliminating the Liberty Global Group's inter-group
interest in the LiLAC Group. The LiLAC Distribution was accounted for prospectively effective July 1, 2016.

  Capital Contributions

     On June 3, 2015, in connection with the Choice Acquisition, an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group made a $10.2
million cash capital contribution to an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group to partially fund the purchase price for Choice.

    On June 30, 2015, an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group made a $100.0 million cash capital contribution to LiLAC
Communications in order to provide liquidity to fund, among other things, the LiLAC Group’s ongoing operating costs and
acquisitions.

  Lila Chile Note

     On July 11, 2014, Lila Chile Holding and Liberty Global Holding B.V. (Liberty Global Holding), an entity attributed to the
Liberty Global Group, entered into a loan agreement (the Lila Chile Note). During the fourth quarter of 2016, the outstanding
principal and interest on the Lila Chile Note was cash settled. At December 31, 2015, Liberty Global Holding owed Lila Chile
Holding $1.1 million in principal pursuant to the Lila Chile Note. The Lila Chile Note bore interest at 5.9% per annum. The
December 31, 2015 principal and accrued interest on the Lila Chile Note are included in the LiLAC Group’s other assets, net, and
the Liberty Global Group’s long-term debt and capital lease obligations in the attributed balance sheet information. The net decrease
in the Lila Chile Note during 2016 includes (i) cash repayments of $8.3 million, (ii) cash loans of $6.8 million and (iii) the transfer
of $0.4 million in non-cash accrued interest to the principal balance. The net decrease in the Lila Chile Note during 2015 includes
(a) cash repayments of $10.0 million, (b) cash loans of $1.4 million and (c) the transfer of $0.3 million in non-cash accrued interest
to the principal balance.

  VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes

     On January 24, 2014, VTR Finance issued the VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes. The use of proceeds from the VTR Finance
Senior Secured Notes to repay debt of UPC Holding has been reflected as a non-cash transaction in this attributed financial
information.

  Related-party Advance

     During 2013, VTR Chile Holdings SpA (VTR Chile Holdings), an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group, made a $600.0
million non-interest bearing advance to UPC Holding, which was repaid in full during 2014. This advance is reflected in inter-
group receipts (payments), net, in the attributed statement of cash flows information. The proceeds received from the repayment
of this advance were used to fund (i) the $435.1 million consideration paid by VTR Chile Holdings to acquire the VTR NCI
Owner’s 20.0% ownership interests in VTR and VTR Wireless, (ii) a $128.5 million distribution to an entity attributed to the
Liberty Global Group, which represented a return of capital, and (iii) the settlement of certain derivative instruments of VTR.

  UPC Broadband France Loan

     The UPC Broadband France Loan, as amended, represented amounts owed by VTR to UPC Broadband France SAS (UPC
Broadband France), an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group. The UPC Broadband France Loan bore interest at the
Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the UPC Broadband France Loan agreement) plus 2.0%. In January 2014, a parent of UPC Broadband
France made a capital contribution in the amount of $444.9 million to the parent of VTR, which was used to acquire the corresponding
loan receivable from UPC Broadband France and pay related accrued interest. Accordingly, the UPC Broadband France Loan was
effectively settled within the LiLAC Group. The cash outflow related to Liberty Global Group’s capital contribution has been
reflected in inter-group receipts (payments), net, in financing activities in the attributed statement of cash flows information and
the cash inflow to the Liberty Global Group related to the sale of the loan receivable has been reflected in inter-group receipts, net
in investing activities in the attributed statement of cash flows information. The cash effects of these transactions for the LiLAC
Group are reflected in inter-group receipts (payments), net, in financing activities in the attributed statement of cash flows
information. During 2014, VTR incurred related-party interest expense on the UPC Broadband France Loan of $0.3 million.

  UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan

     Prior to December 31, 2011, Liberty Global Europe Holding BV, an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group, had loaned
an aggregate of $99.4 million (the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan) to an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group. The interest
rate on the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan was 9.39% in 2014. In January 2014, the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan
was settled through a non-cash capital contribution by Liberty Global Europe to an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group. During
2014, VTR incurred related-party interest expense on the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan of $0.3 million.
