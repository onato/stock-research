Executing on mission to create and unlock value for
Liberty shareholders
Denver, Colorado: August 1, 2025 - Liberty Global Ltd. announces its Q2 2025 financial results.

CEO Mike Fries stated, “In the second quarter, we continued to execute across our strategic pillars –
Liberty Growth, Liberty Telecom and Liberty Services & Corporate, with an unwavering focus on
creating and delivering value to shareholders. We are encouraged to see our strategy to unlock value
succeeding, with Sunrise continuing to trade higher post-spin, particularly when factoring in its inaugural
dividend payment which was paid in May.

•   Our Liberty Telecom operations remain focused on improving commercial momentum against the
    continued backdrop of intense competition. At VodafoneZiggo, we saw early signs of improving
    fixed-line performance under its new strategic plan. Telenet delivered another solid quarter, with
    positive broadband growth and a return to mobile postpaid additions. VMO2 is nearing the
    completion of its acquisition of the B2B business Daisy, bolstering our growth ambitions in this
    segment, whilst continuing to deliver Adj. EBITDA3 growth in Q2.

•   Strategically we continue to invest in our network positions with VMO2 set to benefit
    significantly over time through the acquisition of spectrum from Vodafone/3, which will take our total
    spectrum share to ~30% in the UK. Ireland remains on track with its accelerated FTTH upgrade
    program, including the addition of a new wholesale customer during the quarter. Wyre and
    Proximus have strongly progressed to reach an agreement in principle regarding the fixed network
    sharing initiative and anticipate the start of a market test in September.

•   Our Liberty Growth portfolio FMV increased to $3.4 billion1 during the quarter, with the top six
    investments2 now comprising over 80% of the overall portfolio's value. Formula E hosted its flagship
    race quarter, including stops in Monaco, Miami and Tokyo, with cumulative viewership for season 11
    now expected to surpass 500 million. Lastly, we exited our Vodafone collar position and continue to
    target $500-750m of non-core asset disposals this year.

•   Our Liberty Services platforms in Finance and Tech continue making progress, with new client
    wins at Liberty Blume, our financial services business, during the second quarter.

•   Finally, following the successful spin-off of Sunrise in November 2024, we are currently
    working on opportunities to separate our remaining core operating units and/or assets to unlock the
    conglomerate discount in our stock. The unique structure of our balance sheet and holdings
    provides us with the flexibility to pursue additional spin-offs, tracking stocks, IPOs and other
    transactions, in multiple combinations. The specific timing of these transactions is to be determined,
    but we are targeting completion of one or more in the next 12 to 24 months. It’s also important to
    note that none of these potential transactions are dependent on M&A in any of our existing markets.

                                                                                                                 1
We are reconfirming all guidance metrics for our Liberty Telecom operations while raising Telenet's Adj.
EBITDAaL outlook4. In addition, we now expect an improved outlook for Liberty Services & Corporate
Adj. EBITDA of negative ~$175m for 20254, driven by cost optimization initiatives."

Virgin Media O2 continues growth in Adjusted EBITDA3 and
executing on network upgrade plans
VMO2 maintained Adj. EBITDA growth during the second quarter supported by a stable core
revenue performance and cost efficiencies. Commercially, the UK market remains very
competitive, impacting volumes across both broadband and mobile postpaid. Nonetheless, we
executed on price adjustments during the quarter and remain focused on improving commercial
momentum and retention through a range of initiatives. VMO2 remains on track to deliver 2025
guidance for growth across core revenues and Adj. EBITDA.

Highlights for Q2
•   Advancing commercial initiatives: Customer service transformation has more than halved Virgin
    Media complaints year-over-year; proposition enhancements include data rollover on O2 premium
    plans and multi-SIM capability for the converged Volt proposition
•   Combined full fiber footprint: Over 7 million7 fiber premises, executing fixed network upgrade and
    rollout on behalf of nexfibre
•   Spectrum Acquisition: VMO2 to acquire 78.8 MHz of spectrum for an investment of £343 million,
    bringing total mobile spectrum share to approximately 30%. Spectrum transfer is expected to begin
    in H2 2025, with 2025 investment funded by the minority stake sale of Cornerstone in 2024

Q2 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP, as reported by Liberty Global)8
•   Revenue of $3,373.5 million, -0.1% YoY on a reported basis and -5.5% YoY on a rebased9 basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by the net effect of (i) lower B2B fixed revenue as a result of lower rental
        revenues and (ii) lower construction revenue from nexfibre, with each revenue category as
        defined and reported by the VMO2 JV
•   Adjusted EBITDA10 of $1,172.3 million, +3.5% YoY on a reported basis and -2.1% on a rebased
    basis

     ◦     Q2 2025 included the benefit of £105.8 million of U.S. GAAP/IFRS differences, primarily related
           to (i) the VMO2 JV's investment in CTIL and (ii) leases
•    Adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of nexfibre construction of £985.9 million, +1.1% YoY on a
     reported and rebased basis
•    The drivers of these IFRS changes are largely consistent with those under U.S. GAAP as detailed

VodafoneZiggo executing on new strategic plan with signs of
commercial improvement
VodafoneZiggo's second quarter results saw the anticipated impact of the new strategic plan
including new front book tariffs implemented during the first quarter. Encouragingly, as the
second quarter progressed, we saw growing commercial momentum in fixed broadband as
churn improved. For the remainder of the year, we are committed to further commercial
initiatives and the implementation of a new agile operating model. We remain on track to deliver
guidance for 2025 as revised at Q1.

Highlights for Q2
•   Improving commercial performance: Improved broadband trend through the second quarter
    following the implementation of new front book pricing and proactive customer migrations to those
    tariffs from March; successful start to Ziggo brand repositioning with new marketing campaigns,
    including WiFi Guarantee
•   Fixed network expansion: Announced fiber wholesale deal with Delta Fiber, expanding reach to
    600k homes in off-net areas; commercial launch expected in 2026
•   Operating efficiency: New operating model implemented July 1, creating a leaner and more agile
    operating structure

Q2 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP)
•   Revenue of $1,123.3 million, +2.9% YoY on a reported basis and -2.4% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) a decline in the consumer fixed base, (ii) front book repricing impact and
        (iii) lower B2B mobile revenue, partially offset by (a) growth in B2B fixed and (b) growth in Ziggo
        Sport Totaal revenue
•   Adjusted EBITDA of $496.7 million, -4.2% YoY on a reported basis and -9.1% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) the aforementioned decrease in revenue, (ii) higher programming costs
        related to the UEFA broadcast, and (iii) higher marketing costs, partially offset by cost control
        measures
•   Cash flows from operating activities of $251.7 million, cash flows from investing activities of -$118.8
    million and cash flows from financing activities of -$134.5 million

Q2 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP) in local currency
•   Revenue of €989.9 million, -2.4% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of €438.0 million, -9.1% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis

Q2 Operating Highlights
•   Broadband net losses of 27,500 improved sequentially and as the quarter progressed, reflecting
    improvements in churn following the new front book and proactive customer migrations
•   Postpaid net losses of 8,400, driven by low-margin B2B port outs, as Consumer remained positive
•   Fixed ARPU increased 0.9% YoY, as the benefit of the prior year's price adjustment was impacted
    by the proactive right-pricing of the new front book
•   Successful WiFi Guarantee campaign launched in May and ongoing CPE swaps


                                                                                                              7

Telenet delivered growth in broadband and postpaid during the
second quarter resulting in an improved outlook for the year
Telenet continued to deliver strong results during the second quarter, supported by the earlier
annual price adjustment and improved commercial momentum in broadband and postpaid.
Strategically, expansion in the South of Belgium continues to gain momentum, with BASE also
compensating for the heightened competitive environment in mobile. Following the strong
overall first half performance, Telenet now expects a 'low-single digit decline' in Adj. EBITDAaL4,
at the top-end of the previous outlook range, notwithstanding the upcoming tough Q3
comparator as previously highlighted.

Highlights for Q2
•   Broadband and postpaid growth: Despite the competitive environment, Telenet delivered growth
    in the subscriber base, with BASE continuing its solid growth since launch last year
•   Price adjustment: Implemented price adjustment from April of ~3% across the Telenet brand,
    benefiting the quarter from earlier implementation as compared to the prior year
•   FTTH sharing: Proximus, Fiberklaar, Telenet and Wyre have strongly progressed to reach an
    agreement in principle on the terms of a future collaboration to accelerate the deployment of fiber
    networks across Flanders. Parties are working closely with the BCA and BIPT and anticipate the
    start of a market test in September

Q2 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP, as consolidated by Liberty Global)
•   Revenue of $801.0 million, +6.1% YoY on a reported basis and +0.6% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) higher fixed revenue supported by the April price rise and (ii) higher
        programming revenue, partially offset by (a) lower interconnect revenue and (b) lower handset
        sales
•   Adjusted EBITDA of $337.9 million, +8.3% YoY on a reported basis and +2.8% on a rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDAaL of $337.7 million, +8.3% YoY on a reported basis and +2.8% on a rebased
    basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by (i) the increase in revenue, (ii) lower labor costs and (iii) lower sales and
        marketing costs, partially offset by (a) higher IT costs and (b) higher costs related to
        professional services and outsourced labor
•   Property and equipment additions of $269.3 million, +33.8% YoY on a reported basis and +27.2%
    on a rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of $68.6 million, -38.0% YoY on a reported basis and -41.3%
    on a rebased basis
•   Cash flows from operating activities of $290.0 million, cash flows from investing activities of -$262.4
    million and cash flows from financing activities of -$40.9 million

Q2 Financial Highlights (in IFRS, as guided to and aligned with bondholder covenants)11
•   Revenue of €705.9 million, +0.6% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of €341.5 million, +3.6% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis




                                                                                                              9
    ◦   Q2 2025 included the benefit of €43.7 million of U.S. GAAP/IFRS differences, primarily related
        to (i) sports and film broadcasting rights and (ii) leases
•   Adjusted EBITDAaL of €322.1 million, +4.0% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   The drivers of these IFRS changes are largely consistent with those under U.S. GAAP as detailed
    above

Q2 Operating Highlights
•   Broadband returned to modest growth, with net adds of 900, supported by reduced churn and
    continued expansion of BASE FMC in the South
•   Postpaid mobile also returned to growth, with net adds of 1,300 as BASE mitigated the impact of
    heightened competition in the Belgian market
•   Fixed ARPU grew by 3.1% YoY, supported by the price adjustment of ~3% from April on the Telenet
    brand, which took effect earlier than in the prior year

2025 Telenet guidance (in IFRS)4
•   We are confirming:
    ◦   Broadly stable revenue (FY 2024: €2,851.4 million)
    ◦   P&E Additions as a percentage of revenue of around 38%

Virgin Media Ireland continues to expand full fiber network and
wholesale customer base
Virgin Media Ireland's second quarter results were impacted by intense competition in the
market which drove a decline in revenue and Adj. EBITDA. While the competitive landscape
remains challenging, Virgin Media Ireland continues to make progress against its strategic
targets, which include rolling out FTTH, increasing wholesale penetration and driving
commercial momentum in mobile.

Highlights for Q2
•   Network upgrade: Fiber rollout continuing at pace, with over 550,000 premises upgraded to full
    fiber at the end of Q2; 80% targeted by end of 2025 and remain on track to complete program in
    2026
•   Speed leadership: Launched Ireland's first 5 gigabit fiber broadband service
•   Wholesale: Announced a wholesale access deal with Digiweb in June and continued to grow the
    wholesale customer base

Q2 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP)
•   Revenue of $122.8 million, +2.3% YoY on a reported basis and -3.0% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily driven by lower fixed and mobile revenue resulting from the intense competitive
        environment, partially offset by continued strong growth in B2B wholesale revenue
•   Adjusted EBITDA of $41.4 million, -9.4% YoY on a reported basis and -14.1% on a rebased basis
    ◦   Primarily due to the aforementioned revenue decline and the impact of lower wholebuy and
        content costs in Q2 2024
•   Cash flows from operating activities of $46.3 million, cash flows from investing activities of -$61.3
    million, and cash flows from financing activities of $14.8 million

Q2 Financial Highlights (in U.S. GAAP) in local currency
•   Revenue of €108.2 million, -3.0% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis
•   Adjusted EBITDA of €36.5 million, -14.1% YoY on both a reported and rebased basis

Q2 Operating Highlights
•   Broadband net losses of 3,900 were impacted by continued competitive intensity in the market
•   Postpaid net adds of 2,200 continued to improve both sequentially and YoY, primarily due to launch
    of new mobile offer during the quarter
•   Over 1.5 million addressable homes, including off-net footprint
•   Over 13% of the broadband base now on fiber




                                                                                                        11

Footnotes for Operating Data and Subscriber Variance Tables:

 (i)
          In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. The mobile subscriber count for the VMO2 JV includes IoT connections, which are
          Machine-to-Machine contract mobile connections, including Smart Metering contract connections. The mobile subscriber count presented above for the VMO2 JV excludes wholesale mobile
          connections of approximately 10,151,900 that are included in the total mobile subscriber count as defined and presented by the VMO2 JV.
 (ii)
          Fixed-line counts for the VodafoneZiggo JV include certain B2B customers and subscribers.

Additional General Notes to Tables:

Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide broadband, telephony, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a
premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with broadband, video or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers.
All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our
broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from
a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception
of our B2B SOHO subscribers and mobile subscribers at medium and large enterprises, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the
nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process.
We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to
time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.

The condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows of Liberty Global are in
our 10-Q.

Rebase Information
Rebase growth percentages, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a
comparable basis. For purposes of calculating rebase growth rates on a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned
during 2025, we have adjusted our historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2024 to (i) include the pre-acquisition revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions to the
same extent these entities are included in our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, (ii) exclude from our
rebased amounts the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of entities disposed of to the same extent these entities
are excluded in our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, (iii) include in our rebased amounts the impact
to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of activity between our continuing and discontinued operations related to the Tech
Framework that previously eliminated within our consolidated results, (iv) include in our rebased amounts the revenue and
costs for the temporary elements of transitional and other services provided to iliad, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise,
to reflect amounts related to these services equal to those included in our results for the three and six months ended June 30,
2025 and (v) reflect the translation of our rebased amounts at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that
were used to translate our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. For entities we have acquired during
2024, we have reflected the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of these acquired entities in our 2024 rebased
amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-
acquisition financial statements), as adjusted for the estimated effects of (a) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP
and local generally accepted accounting principles, (b) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (c) any
significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and (d) other items we deem
appropriate. We do not adjust pre-acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any
changes in estimates that might be implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired
businesses during the pre-acquisition periods, no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to
present the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of these entities on a basis that is
comparable to the corresponding post-acquisition amounts that are included in our results or that the pre-acquisition financial
statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors. In addition, the rebase growth percentages are not
necessarily indicative of the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions that would have occurred if
these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue,
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions that will occur in the future. Investors should view rebase growth
as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of performance included in our condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

          In addition to our acquisitions and dispositions, these rebase adjustments include amounts related to agreements to provide transitional
          and other services to iliad, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise. These adjustments result in an equal amount of fees in both the

          and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered, and as repayments of debt when the related principal is repaid.

     period to period.
5    Consolidated intercompany eliminations amounts for the six months ended June 30, 2024 within the Financial Highlights tables primarily
     relate to (i) revenue and Adjusted EBITDA within our T&I Function of ($63 million) and ($44 million), respectively, related to Tech
     Framework revenues and eliminations with Sunrise prior to the Spin-off and (ii) transactions between our continuing and discontinued
     operations. For additional information on the Tech Framework, see the Glossary.

12   VMO2 guidance presented on an IFRS basis as guided by the VMO2 JV. US GAAP guidance for the VMO2 JV cannot be provided
     without unreasonable efforts, as the VMO2 JV reports under IFRS and does not have U.S. GAAP forecasts for all components of their
     IFRS guidance.
13   VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF excludes financing and investing cash flows related to potential acquisitions and mobile spectrum auction
     fees.
14   For purposes of calculating our average tenor, total third-party debt excludes vendor financing, certain debt obligations that we assumed
     in connection with various acquisitions, debt collateralized by certain trade receivables of Telenet and liabilities related to Telenet's
     acquisition of mobile spectrum licenses. The percentage of debt not due until 2029 or thereafter includes all of these amounts.
15   Liquidity refers to cash and cash equivalents and investments held under separately managed accounts plus the maximum undrawn
     commitments under subsidiary borrowing facilities, without regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to
     borrowing.
16   Our aggregate unused borrowing capacity of $0.9 billion represents the maximum availability under the applicable facilities at June 30,
     2025 without regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. Upon completion of the relevant
     June 30, 2025 compliance reporting requirements for our credit facilities, and assuming no further changes from quarter-end borrowing
     levels, we anticipate that the full unused borrowing capacity will continue to be available under each of the respective subsidiary facilities.
     Our above expectations do not consider any actual or potential changes to our borrowing levels or any amounts loaned or distributed
     subsequent to June 30, 2025, or the full impact of additional amounts that may be available to borrow, loan or distribute under certain
     defined baskets within each respective facility.

See Reconciliations section of the Appendix below for applicable non-GAAP reconciliations.

10-Q or 10-K: As used herein, the terms 10-Q and 10-K refer to our most recent quarterly or annual report as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as applicable.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and Property and Equipment Additions (P&E Additions):

•    Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating
     performance and is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii)
     evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term,
     Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before net income tax benefit (expense), other non-operating
     income or expenses, net share of results of affiliates, net gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, net realized and unrealized gains
     (losses) due to changes in fair values of certain investments, net foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net gains (losses) on
     derivative instruments, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision
     releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains
     and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions
     and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains
     and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure
     because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows
     management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3)
     identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our consolidated Adjusted
     EBITDA measure, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance
     with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to
     similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDA of our Liberty Growth strategic platform and our Liberty Services
     strategic platform, together with our corporate functions, are each non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed
     as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our
     condensed consolidated statements of operations.

•    Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions: We define Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions, which is a non-GAAP measure, as Adjusted
     EBITDA less P&E Additions on an accrual basis. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions is a meaningful measure because it provides (i) a
     transparent view of Adjusted EBITDA that remains after our capital spend, which we believe is important to take into account when
     evaluating our overall performance and (ii) a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies. Our
     Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions measure may differ from how other companies define and apply their definition of similar measures.
     Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a
     substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

•    P&E Additions: Includes capital expenditures, including capitalized software, on an accrual basis, amounts financed under vendor
     financing or finance lease arrangements and other non-cash additions.

Adjusted EBITDA after leases (Adjusted EBITDAaL): We define Adjusted EBITDAaL as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to include finance
lease related depreciation and interest expense. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDAaL is a meaningful measure because it
represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that includes recurring lease expenses necessary to operate our
business. We believe Adjusted EBITDAaL, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing
our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly
comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDAaL should be viewed as a measure of operating
performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF) & Distributable Cash Flow:

•    Adjusted FCF: We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related
     vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor
     payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash
     payments in the period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors
     and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and
     intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (iii) principal payments on
     finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our condensed consolidated
     statements of cash flows with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. Net cash provided by
     operating activities of our continuing operations includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and
     unsuccessful acquisition and dispositions of $1.1 million and $5.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024,
     respectively.

     For purposes of the statements of cash flows, operating-related vendor financing additions represent operating-related expenses
     financed by an intermediary that are treated as constructive operating cash outflows and constructive financing cash inflows when the
     intermediary settles the liability with the vendor. When the financing intermediary is paid, a financing cash outflow is recorded in the
     statements of cash flows. For purposes of Adjusted FCF, we (i) add in the constructive financing cash inflow when the intermediary settles




                                                                                                                                             41
     the liability with the vendor as our actual net cash available at that time is not affected and (ii) subsequently deduct the related financing
     cash outflow when we actually pay the financing intermediary, reflecting the actual reduction to our cash available to service debt or fund
     new investment opportunities.

•    Distributable Cash Flow: We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted FCF plus any dividends received from our equity affiliates that
     are funded by activities outside of their normal course of operations, including, for example, those funded by recapitalizations (referred to
     as “Other Affiliate Dividends”).

•    VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF: VodafoneZiggo defines Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities, plus (i) operating-
     related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to actual cash available as a result of extending vendor
     payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities) and (ii) interest
     payments on shareholder loans, less (a) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures (excluding spectrum payments), (b)
     principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in
     the period to actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended
     vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (c) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the
     period to actual cash available).

     We believe our presentation of Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF, each of which is a non-GAAP
     measure, provides useful information to our investors because these measures can be used to gauge our ability to (i) service debt and (ii)
     fund new investment opportunities after consideration of all actual cash payments related to our working capital activities and expenses
     that are capital in nature, whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which
     case we typically pay in less than 365 days). Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF should not be
     understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including
     debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at these amounts. Investors should view Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and
     VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF as supplements to, and not substitutes for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our condensed
     consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF may differ
     from how other companies define and apply their definition of Adjusted FCF or other similar measures.

ARPU: Average Revenue Per Unit is the average monthly subscription revenue per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber,
as applicable. ARPU per average fixed-line customer relationship is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from
residential fixed and SOHO services by the average number of fixed-line customer relationships for the period. ARPU per average mobile
subscriber is calculated by dividing mobile subscription revenue for the indicated period by the average number of mobile subscribers for the
period. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber is not adjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per
RGU refers to average monthly revenue per average RGU, which is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from
residential and SOHO services for the indicated period, by the average number of the applicable RGUs for the period. Unless otherwise noted,
ARPU in this release is considered to be ARPU per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Fixed-line
customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs of entities acquired during the period are normalized. In addition, for purposes of
calculating the percentage change in ARPU on a rebased basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, we adjust the prior-year subscription revenue,
fixed-line customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs, as applicable, to reflect acquisitions, dispositions and FX on a comparable
basis with the current year, consistent with how we calculate our rebased growth for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, as further described in the
body of this release.

ARPU per Consumer Postpaid Mobile Subscriber: Our ARPU per consumer postpaid mobile subscriber calculation refers to the average
monthly postpaid mobile subscription revenue per average consumer postpaid mobile subscriber and is calculated by dividing the average
monthly postpaid mobile subscription revenue (excluding handset sales and late fees) for the indicated period, by the monthly average of the
opening and closing balances of consumer postpaid mobile subscribers in service for the period.

Blended, fully-swapped debt borrowing cost (or WACD): The weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate
indebtedness (excluding finance leases and including vendor financing obligations), including the effects of derivative instruments, original
issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs. The weighted average interest rate calculation
includes principal amounts outstanding associated with all of our secured and unsecured borrowings.

Broadband Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that
we service through a partner network.

B2B: Business-to-Business.

Costs to capture: Costs to capture generally include incremental, third-party operating and capital related costs that are directly associated
with integration activities, restructuring activities and certain other costs associated with aligning an acquiree to our business processes to
derive synergies. These costs are necessary to combine the operations of a business being acquired (or joint venture being formed) with ours
or are incidental to the acquisition. As a result, costs to capture may include certain (i) operating costs that are included in Adjusted EBITDA,
(ii) capital-related costs that are included in property and equipment additions and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and (iii) certain
integration-related restructuring expenses that are not included within Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions. Given the
achievement of synergies occurs over time, certain of our costs to capture are recurring by nature, and generally incurred within a few years of
completing the transaction.

Customer Churn: The rate at which customers relinquish their subscriptions. The annual rolling average basis is calculated by dividing the
number of disconnects during the preceding 12 months by the average number of customer relationships. For the purpose of computing churn,




                                                                                                                                                42
a disconnect is deemed to have occurred if the customer no longer receives any level of service from us and is required to return our
equipment. A partial product downgrade, typically used to encourage customers to pay an outstanding bill and avoid complete service
disconnection, is not considered to be disconnected for purposes of our churn calculations. Customers who move within our footprint and
upgrades and downgrades between services are also excluded from the disconnect figures used in the churn calculation.

Fixed-Line Customer Relationships: The number of customers who receive at least one of our broadband, video or telephony services that we
count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on
a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that
individual generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer
Relationships.

Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC): Fixed-mobile convergence penetration represents the number of customers who subscribe to both a fixed
broadband service and postpaid mobile telephony service, divided by the total number of customers who subscribe to our fixed broadband
service.

Homes Passed: Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially
extending the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to
the data or from new census results.

Homes Serviceable: As defined by VMO2, this includes homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to
VMO2's networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services (including broadband, video and telephony services) or
partner networks with which VMO2 has a service agreement, where customers can request and receive services, without materially extending
the distribution plant. Certain of VMO2's Homes Serviceable counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to
the data or from new census results.

Liberty Growth: Represents certain investments in technology, media, sports and digital infrastructure companies that we view as scalable
businesses. Our Liberty Growth strategic platform is included in the "all other category" in the 10-Q.

Liberty Services & Corporate: Includes our Liberty Services strategic platform and certain corporate activities, each of which is included in the
“all other category” in the 10-Q. While certain of these functions provide services to investments included in our Liberty Growth strategic
platform, we have not allocated these costs or cash flows in our internal management reporting or external disclosures.

Mobile Subscriber Count: For residential and business subscribers, the number of active SIM cards in service rather than services provided.
For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively,
a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers. In
a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. Customers who do not pay a recurring
monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry
standards within the respective country. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VMO2 JV's and the VodafoneZiggo JV's mobile
subscriber counts after a period of inactivity of three months and nine months, respectively.

MVNO: Mobile Virtual Network Operator.

RGU: A Revenue Generating Unit is separately a Broadband Subscriber, Video Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential
multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer subscribed to our broadband
service, video service and fixed-line telephony service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Broadband, Video
and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premise does not count as more than
one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a
vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled broadband, video or telephony service is counted as a
separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their
free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without
charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include
subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported
postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

SIM: Subscriber Identification Module.

SOHO: Small or Home Office Subscribers.

Tech Framework: Our centrally-managed technology and innovation function (our T&I Function) provides, and allocates charges for, certain
products and services to our consolidated reportable segments (the Tech Framework). These products and services include CPE hardware
and related essential software, maintenance, hosting and other services. Our consolidated reportable segments capitalize the combined cost
of the CPE hardware and essential software as property and equipment additions and the corresponding amounts charged by our T&I
Function are reflected as revenue when earned.

Telephony Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we
service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers.




                                                                                                                                              43
Video Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or
through a partner network.
