Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and Property and Equipment Additions (P&E Additions):

•   Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance and is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision
    makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, Adjusted EBITDA is
    defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before net income tax benefit (expense), other non-operating income or expenses, net share of results of affiliates, net gains (losses) on debt extinguishment,
    net realized and unrealized gains (losses) due to changes in fair values of certain investments, net foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net interest expense,
    depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include
    (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees,
    as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure
    because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical
    comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
    measure, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our
    measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDA of our Liberty Growth strategic platform and our Liberty Services strategic platform, together with
    our corporate functions, are each non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP
    measures of income included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

•   Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions: We define Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions, which is a non-GAAP measure, as Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions on an accrual basis. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E
    Additions is a meaningful measure because it provides (i) a transparent view of Adjusted EBITDA that remains after our capital spend, which we believe is important to take into account when evaluating our overall
    performance and (ii) a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions measure may differ from how other companies define and
    apply their definition of similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of
    income included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

•   P&E Additions: Includes capital expenditures, including capitalized software, on an accrual basis, amounts financed under vendor financing or finance lease arrangements and other non-cash additions.

Adjusted EBITDA after leases (Adjusted EBITDAaL): We define Adjusted EBITDAaL as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to include finance lease related depreciation and interest expense. Our internal
decision makers believe Adjusted EBITDAaL is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that includes recurring lease expenses necessary to operate our
business. We believe Adjusted EBITDAaL, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or
similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted EBITDAaL should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a
supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF) & Distributable Cash Flow:

•   Adjusted FCF: We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to
    our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash payments in the
    period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a
    result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (iii) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a
    decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations.
    Net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisition and dispositions of $1.1 million and
    $5.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        21
    For purposes of the statements of cash flows, operating-related vendor financing additions represent operating-related expenses financed by an intermediary that are treated as constructive operating cash
    outflows and constructive financing cash inflows when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor. When the financing intermediary is paid, a financing cash outflow is recorded in the statements of cash
    flows. For purposes of Adjusted FCF, we (i) add in the constructive financing cash inflow when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor as our actual net cash available at that time is not affected and (ii)
    subsequently deduct the related financing cash outflow when we actually pay the financing intermediary, reflecting the actual reduction to our cash available to service debt or fund new investment opportunities.

•   Distributable Cash Flow: We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted FCF plus any dividends received from our equity affiliates that are funded by activities outside of their normal course of operations,
    including, for example, those funded by recapitalizations (referred to as “Other Affiliate Dividends”).

•   VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF: VodafoneZiggo defines Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities, plus (i) operating-related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period
    to actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities) and (ii) interest payments on
    shareholder loans, less (a) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures (excluding spectrum payments), (b) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and
    intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the
    normal payment terms), and (c) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to actual cash available).

•   We believe our presentation of Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, provides useful information to our investors because these
    measures can be used to gauge our ability to (i) service debt and (ii) fund new investment opportunities after consideration of all actual cash payments related to our working capital activities and expenses that are
    capital in nature, whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which case we typically pay in less than 365 days). Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash
    Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that
    are not deducted to arrive at these amounts. Investors should view Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF as supplements to, and not substitutes for, U.S. GAAP measures of
    liquidity included in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our Adjusted FCF, Distributable Cash Flow and VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF may differ from how other companies define and
    apply their definition of Adjusted FCF or other similar measures.

ARPU: Average Revenue Per Unit is the average monthly subscription revenue per average fixed customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. ARPU per average fixed-line customer relationship is
calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from residential fixed and SOHO services by the average number of fixed-line customer relationships for the period. ARPU per average mobile
subscriber is calculated by dividing mobile subscription revenue for the indicated period by the average number of mobile subscribers for the period. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per fixed customer relationship
or mobile subscriber is not adjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per RGU refers to average monthly revenue per average RGU, which is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from
residential and SOHO services for the indicated period, by the average number of the applicable RGUs for the period. Unless otherwise noted, ARPU in this release is considered to be ARPU per average fixed
customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Fixed-line customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs of entities acquired during the period are normalized. In addition, for purposes of calculating
the percentage change in ARPU on a rebased basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, we adjust the prior-year subscription revenue, fixed-line customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs, as applicable, to
reflect acquisitions, dispositions and FX on a comparable basis with the current year, consistent with how we calculate our rebased growth for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, as further described in the body of this
release.

ARPU per Consumer Postpaid Mobile Subscriber: Our ARPU per consumer postpaid mobile subscriber calculation refers to the average monthly postpaid mobile subscription revenue per average consumer
postpaid mobile subscriber and is calculated by dividing the average monthly postpaid mobile subscription revenue (excluding handset sales and late fees) for the indicated period, by the monthly average of the
opening and closing balances of consumer postpaid mobile subscribers in service for the period.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                              22
Blended, fully-swapped debt borrowing cost (or WACD): The weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness (excluding finance leases and including vendor financing
obligations), including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs. The weighted average interest rate calculation
includes principal amounts outstanding associated with all of our secured and unsecured borrowings.

Broadband Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network.

B2B: Business-to-Business.

Cost to capture: Costs to capture generally include incremental, third-party operating and capital related costs that are directly associated with integration activities, restructuring activities and certain other costs
associated with aligning an acquiree to our business processes to derive synergies. These costs are necessary to combine the operations of a business being acquired (or joint venture being formed) with ours or are
incidental to the acquisition. As a result, costs to capture may include certain (i) operating costs that are included in Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) capital-related costs that are included in property and equipment additions
and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions and (iii) certain integration-related restructuring expenses that are not included within Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions. Given the achievement of
synergies occurs over time, certain of our costs to capture are recurring by nature, and generally incurred within a few years of completing the transaction.

Customer Churn: The rate at which customers relinquish their subscriptions. The annual rolling average basis is calculated by dividing the number of disconnects during the preceding 12 months by the average
number of customer relationships. For the purpose of computing churn, a disconnect is deemed to have occurred if the customer no longer receives any level of service from us and is required to return our
equipment. A partial product downgrade, typically used to encourage customers to pay an outstanding bill and avoid complete service disconnection, is not considered to be disconnected for purposes of our churn
calculations. Customers who move within our footprint and upgrades and downgrades between services are also excluded from the disconnect figures used in the churn calculation.
Fixed-Line Customer Relationships: The number of customers who receive at least one of our broadband, video or telephony services that we count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they
subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that
individual generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer Relationships.

Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC): Fixed-mobile convergence penetration represents the number of customers who subscribe to both a fixed broadband service and postpaid mobile telephony service, divided by
the total number of customers who subscribe to our fixed broadband service.

Homes Passed: Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are
based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results.

Homes Serviceable: As defined by VMO2, this includes homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to VMO2's networks that are technologically capable of providing two-
way services (including broadband, video and telephony services) or partner networks with which VMO2 has a service agreement, where customers can request and receive services, without materially extending the
distribution plant. Certain of VMO2's Homes Serviceable counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results.

Liberty Growth: Represents certain investments in technology, media, sports and digital infrastructure companies that we view as scalable businesses. Our Liberty Growth strategic platform is included in the "all
other category" in the 10-Q.

Liberty Services & Corporate: Includes our Liberty Services strategic platform and certain corporate activities, each of which is included in the “all other category” in the 10-Q. While certain of these functions provide
services to investments included in our Liberty Growth strategic platform, we have not allocated these costs or cash flows in our internal management reporting or external disclosures.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                          23
Mobile Subscriber Count: For residential and business subscribers, the number of active SIM cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a
smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers. In a
number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after
periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VMO2 JV's and the VodafoneZiggo JV's mobile subscriber
counts after a period of inactivity of three months and nine months, respectively.

MVNO: Mobile Virtual Network Operator.

RGU: A Revenue Generating Unit is separately a Broadband Subscriber, Video Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For
example, if a residential customer subscribed to our broadband service, video service and fixed-line telephony service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Broadband, Video and
Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premise does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives
one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled broadband, video or telephony service is counted as a separate
RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to
disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions
to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

SIM: Subscriber Identification Module.

SOHO: Small or Home Office Subscribers.

Tech Framework: Our centrally-managed technology and innovation function (our T&I Function) provides, and allocates charges for, certain products and services to our consolidated reportable segments (the Tech
Framework). These products and services include CPE hardware and related essential software, maintenance, hosting and other services. Our consolidated reportable segments capitalize the combined cost of the
CPE hardware and essential software as property and equipment additions and the corresponding amounts charged by our T&I Function are reflected as revenue when earned.

Telephony Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude
mobile telephony subscribers.

Video Subscriber: A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                      24
Rebase growth percentages, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis. For purposes of calculating rebase growth rates on a comparable basis
for all businesses that we owned during 2025, we have adjusted our historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to (i) include
the pre-acquisition revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions to the same extent these entities are included in our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, (ii) exclude from our rebased
amounts the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E Additions of entities disposed of to the same extent these entities are excluded in our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, (iii) include in our
rebased amounts the impact to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of activity between our continuing and discontinued operations related to the Tech Framework that previously eliminated within our consolidated
results, (iv) include in our rebased amounts the revenue and costs for the temporary elements of transitional and other services provided to iliad, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise, to reflect amounts
related to these services equal to those included in our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and (v) reflect the translation of our rebased amounts at the applicable average foreign currency
exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. For entities we have acquired during 2024, we have reflected the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and P&E
Additions of these acquired entities in our 2024 rebased amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-acquisition financial statements), as
adjusted for the estimated effects of (a) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP and local generally accepted accounting principles, (b) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (c) any
significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and (d) other items we deem appropriate. We do not adjust pre-acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to
give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired businesses during the pre-acquisition periods, no
assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions of these entities on a basis that is comparable to the
corresponding post-acquisition amounts that are included in our results or that the pre-acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors. In addition, the rebase growth
percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for
purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions that will occur in the future. Investors should view rebase growth as a supplement to, and
not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of performance included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                  25
The following table provides adjustments made to 2024 amounts (i) for our consolidated continuing operations and (ii) for the nonconsolidated VMO2 JV and VodafoneZiggo JV to derive our rebased growth rates:




(i)    In addition to our acquisitions and dispositions, these rebase adjustments include amounts related to agreements to provide transitional and other services to iliad, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Sunrise.
       These adjustments result in an equal amount of fees in both the 2025 and 2024 periods for those services that are deemed to be temporary in nature.
(ii)   Amounts reflect 100% of the adjustments made related to the VMO2 JV's and the VodafoneZiggo JV's revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions, which we do not consolidate, as
       we hold a 50% noncontrolling interest in the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                  26

Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF) & Distributable Cash Flow:

• Adjusted FCF: We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related vendor financed
  expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment
  terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal
  payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual
  cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal
  payment terms), and (iii) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported
  in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. Net cash
  provided by operating activities of our continuing operations includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful
  acquisition and dispositions of $1.1 million and $5.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

• Distributable Cash Flow: We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted FCF plus any dividends received from our equity affiliates that are funded by
  activities outside of their normal course of operations, including, for example, those funded by recapitalizations (referred to as “Other Affiliate Dividends”).




                                                                                                                                                                      33

We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by the operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of
extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating-
and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended
vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms), and (iii) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows
with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. Net cash provided by operating activities includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisition and
dispositions of $1.1 million and $5.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted FCF plus any dividends received from our equity affiliates that are funded by
activities outside of their normal course of operations, including, for example, those funded by recapitalizations (referred to as “Other Affiliate Dividends”).

The following table provides a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations to Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the indicated period. In addition, in order to provide information regarding our
Adjusted Attributed Free Cash Flow and Attributed Distributable Cash Flow, which are used for internal management reporting and capital allocation purposes and are consistent with the way in which our chief operating decision maker
evaluates our operating segments, we have provided a reconciliation of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow to our Adjusted Attributed Free Cash Flow and Attributed Distributable Cash Flow, which incorporate adjustments related to (i) the
Centrally-held Operating Cost Allocation and (ii) the Centrally-held Property and Equipment Attribution, each as further described below. We believe our presentation of Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow, each of which is a non-
GAAP measure, provides useful information to our investors because these measure can be used to gauge our ability to (a) service debt and (b) fund new investment opportunities after consideration of all actual cash payments related to
our working capital activities and expenses that are capital in nature whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which case we typically pay in less than 365 days). Adjusted
FCF and Distributable Cash Flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at
these amounts. Investors should view Adjusted FCF and Distributable Cash Flow as supplements to, and not substitutes for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our Adjusted
FCF and Distributable Cash Flow may differ from how other companies define and apply their definition of Adjusted FCF or other similar measures.

a.   Includes the impact of intersegment eliminations.

b.   Liberty Services & Corporate incurs certain operating costs related to our centrally-managed technology and innovation function. These costs are allocated from Liberty Services & Corporate to certain operating segments that do
     not have formal agreements in place under the Tech Framework, referred to as the “Centrally-held Operating Cost Allocations”. The allocation of these costs to certain of our operating segments is consistent with the way in which
     our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Adjusted EBITDA of these operating segments. For purposes of our Attributed Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow presentation and consistent with our internal
     management reporting, we assume the allocations to these operating segments are cash settled in the period they are incurred. As a result, any working capital or other free cash flow benefit or detriment related to the actual timing
     of payments are reported within Liberty Services & Corporate.

c.   Liberty Services & Corporate incurs certain capital costs for the benefit of our operating segments. Generally, the expense associated with these capital costs is allocated and/or charged to certain of our operating segments that do
     not have formal agreements in place under the Tech Framework as related-party fees and allocations in their respective statements of operations over the period in which the operating segment benefits from the use of the Liberty
     Services & Corporate asset. These amounts are based on (i) our estimate of its share of underlying costs, (ii) our estimate of its share of the underlying costs plus a mark-up or (iii) commercially-negotiated rates. These charges
     and allocations differ from the attributed Adjusted EBITDA less P&E Additions approach used for internal management reporting. For internal management reporting and capital allocation purposes, we evaluate the Adjusted
     EBITDA less P&E Additions of certain of our operating segments on an "attributed" basis, whereby we estimate and attribute certain capital costs incurred by Liberty Services & Corporate to certain of our operating segments as if
     that operating segment directly incurred its estimated share of the capital costs in the same period the costs were incurred by Liberty Services & Corporate, referred to as the “Centrally-held Property and Equipment Additions”.
     These capital costs represent assets that are jointly used by these operating segments. The amounts attributed to each operating segment are estimated based on (a) actual costs incurred by Liberty Services & Corporate, without
     any mark-up, and (b) each respective operating segment's estimated use of the associated assets. For purposes of our Attributed Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow presentation and consistent with our internal
     management reporting, we assume the attributions to these operating segments are cash settled in the period they are incurred. As a result, any working capital or other free cash flow benefit or detriment related to the actual timing
     of payments are reported within Liberty Services & Corporate.

VodafoneZiggo JV Adjusted FCF is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, plus (i) operating-related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the
period to actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing
activities), and (ii) interest payments on certain Shareholder loans, less (a) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures (excluding spectrum payments), (b) principal
payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to actual cash available as a result of
paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where terms had previously been extended beyond the normal payment terms) and (c) principal payments on finance leases (which
represents a decrease in the period to actual cash available). We believe that the presentation of VodafoneZiggo JV Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful information to our
investors because this measure can be used to gauge VodafoneZiggo’s ability to service debt, distribute cash to parent entities and fund new investment opportunities after
consideration of all actual cash payments related to working capital activities and expenses that are capital in nature whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid
later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which case amounts are typically paid in less than 365 days). VodafoneZiggo JV Adj FCF, which is a non-GAAP measure, should
not be understood to represent VodafoneZiggo’s ability to fund discretionary amounts, as it has various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that are
not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view adjusted free cash flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in
VodafoneZiggo’s consolidated statements of cash flows within its bond report. Further, VodafoneZiggo Adjusted FCF may differ from how other companies define and apply their
definition of Adjusted FCF or other similar measures. For purposes of its standalone reporting obligations, VodafoneZiggo prepares its consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure as contemplated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A reconciliation of VodafoneZiggo JV Adjusted FCF for the
