                             LIBERTY GLOBAL 1
Dear Shareholders
                   2015 was another year of solid performance for Liberty Global. We
                    ƈ ƈ 
                   operating momentum, setting the stage for accelerating growth in the
                   years ahead as we continue to invest, innovate and do more for our
                   customers.

                   One of the most important trends across our markets is convergence.

                   seamlessly connected on any device wherever they go. Earlier this year,
                   we closed the acquisition of BASE in Belgium and we also announced a
                   joint venture with Vodafone in the Netherlands, boosting our ability to
                   provide converged services in two of our key markets. Another important
                   transaction is the pending acquisition of Cable & Wireless, which will
                   add substantial scale and position our Latin American and Caribbean
                   business for continued growth and consolidation across the region.

                   Since the formation of Liberty Global over ten years ago, we have
                   delivered 42 straight quarters of growth in subscribers, revenue and

performance continued to improve throughout the year. Driven by strong demand for our
market-leading broadband products, we added 870,000 new subscribers last year, on an
organic basis, as we continue to set the gold standard in terms of download speeds. We ended
the year with over 27 million unique customers subscribing to 57 million video, voice and
broadband services. We also won more than 450,000 post-paid mobile subscribers during the
year, which highlights the growing importance of converged services to our customers.

surged more than 20% to $2.5 billion for the full year, exceeding our guidance for mid-teens
growth.

Our new plan for growth
Over the next three years, we expect our rebased OCF growth to accelerate to a 7%-9%
compounded annual growth rate as we execute our bold new Liberty GO transformation plan.
Supporting our value-creation strategy, Liberty GO aims to enhance our revenue and operating

of a streamlined operating model.

To deliver on these ambitions, we are further embedding customer centricity across our
operations. In 2015, we rolled out one global methodology to track Net Promoter Scores (NPS)
across our markets, which helps us better understand our consumers’ needs and prioritize our
investments as we do more to improve the customer experience.

In video, consumers continue to embrace our next-generation TV platforms, which provide
seamless entertainment both in and out of the home, on all devices, with a deep catalog of
movies and scripted series available anytime on demand, hundreds of apps, DVR functionality
and, most importantly, a beautiful and intuitive user interface. Across these platforms,
including Horizon TV, we attracted a record 1.5 million new subscribers last year, lifting our

new products like Replay TV, which makes it easy for customers to catch up with their favorite

                   footprint over the next several years, and it inspired us to pursue additional network expansion
                   opportunities in other markets. As a result, we expect to connect seven million new premises
                   over the next three years, including 1.5 million during 2016 alone. These projects not only

                   Our network expansion projects should also fuel incremental customers for our rapidly growing
                   B2B operation, by substantially increasing the number of businesses within reach of our

                   paying off. Rebased revenue from business customers increased 9% to a record $1.9 billion last
                   year, demonstrating that our B2B efforts remain an important part of our growth story.

                   Providing fully converged services
                   We also continue investing in our rapidly expanding out-of-home wireless solutions. Last
                   year, we introduced mobile services in Ireland and Austria and we rolled out 4G services in the
                   Netherlands, Switzerland and Chile - with more markets to follow this year. At the end of 2015,
                   we served 4.8 million mobile subscribers across ten countries, generating $1.5 billion in annual

                   expanding the coverage of our pan-European WiFi network, which we expect will include over
                   ten million access points by the end of 2016.

                   As customers increasingly expect seamless and ubiquitous connectivity, we aim to provide fully
                   converged services offerings across our markets. In Belgium, we took an important step by
                   recently acquiring BASE, the country’s third-largest mobile network operator. We are taking a
                   similar approach in the Netherlands with the proposed 50/50 joint venture between Ziggo and

Consistent with our approach over the past decade, we remain convinced that prudent
management of our capital structure will maximize long-term equity value. Our balance sheet is
in great shape as we continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions, with $4.9 billion of
total liquidity at the end of 2015, along with a record low, fully-hedged borrowing cost of 4.9%
and an average tenor on our long-term debt of more than seven years.

On the equity side, we repurchased a record $2.3 billion of our own stock last year, including
nearly $900 million in the fourth quarter alone. We plan to complete another $4 billion of
buybacks by the end of 2017, which will bring our cumulative stock repurchases to more than
$18 billion since the company was formed back in 2005.

Building a responsible, sustainable business
Our corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts focus primarily on digital inclusion and
building trust with our customers. Across our markets we are undertaking dozens of important
initiatives, from sponsoring coding workshops for kids to teaching senior citizens how to use
the internet, and launching toolkits to help minors stay safe online. Going forward, we will
continue to pursue opportunities to maximize the positive impact of our business and enrich
our customers’ lives in our increasingly connected, digital world.

In closing, we would like to thank our 37,000 employees, whose talent, commitment and hard
work enable us to deliver on our growth agenda and to always do more for our customers -
every single day. We have never been more excited about our future and we appreciate your
continued support.

Item 1. BUSINESS

General Development of Business

     Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global) is an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile
services, serving 27.5 million customers across 14 countries at December 31, 2015. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary Virgin
Media Inc. (Virgin Media), we provide video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the United Kingdom
(U.K.) and Ireland. Through Ziggo Group Holding B.V. (Ziggo Group Holding) and Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia), each a
wholly-owned subsidiary, and Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet), a 56.9%-owned subsidiary, we provide video, broadband
internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, respectively. Through our wholly-
owned subsidiary, UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding), we provide video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in
seven other European countries and mobile services in four other European countries. In Chile, we provide video, broadband
internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services through our wholly-owned subsidiary VTR GlobalCom SpA (VTR). In Puerto
Rico, we provide video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services through Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC
(Liberty Puerto Rico), a 60%-owned subsidiary.

    As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent company
of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media. In the following text,
the terms “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or
collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries.

     On July 1, 2015, we completed the approved steps of the “LiLAC Transaction” whereby we (1) reclassified our then
outstanding Class A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively, the Old Liberty Global Shares) into
corresponding classes of new Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively, the Liberty Global Shares) and (2) capitalized a portion
of our share premium account and distributed as a dividend (or a “bonus issue” under U.K. law) our LiLAC Class A, Class B and
Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the LiLAC Shares). Pursuant to the LiLAC Transaction, each holder of Class A, Class B
and Class C Old Liberty Global Shares remained a holder of the same amount and class of Liberty Global Shares and received
one share of the corresponding class of LiLAC Shares for each 20 Old Liberty Global Shares held as of the record date for such
distribution and cash was issued in lieu of fractional LiLAC Shares.

     The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are tracking shares. Tracking shares are intended by the issuing company
to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic performance of the
company as a whole. The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are intended to track the economic performance of the
“Liberty Global Group” and the “LiLAC Group”, respectively (each as defined and described below). While the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, neither group is a
separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking
shares have no direct claim to the group’s assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking
shares are shareholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors, and are subject to all of the risks and liabilities
of the parent corporation. We and our subsidiaries each continue to be responsible for our respective liabilities. Holders of Liberty
Global Shares, LiLAC Shares and any other of our capital shares designated as ordinary shares from time to time will continue to
be subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both Liberty Global
Shares and LiLAC Shares.

      The LiLAC Group comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed to
it (1) VTR Finance B.V. (VTR Finance) and its subsidiaries, which include VTR, (2) Lila Chile Holding B.V., which is the parent
entity of VTR Finance, (3) LiLAC Holdings Inc. (LiLAC Holdings) and its subsidiaries, which include Liberty Puerto Rico, (4)
LGE Coral Holdco Limited and its subsidiary and (5) prior to July 1, 2015, the costs associated with certain corporate employees
of Liberty Global that are exclusively focused on the management of the LiLAC Group (the LiLAC Corporate Costs). Effective
July 1, 2015, these corporate employees were transferred to LiLAC Holdings. The Liberty Global Group comprises our businesses,
assets and liabilities not attributed to the LiLAC Group, including Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia, Telenet and
UPC Holding, including our direct-to-home satellite (DTH) operations based in Luxembourg, our corporate entities (excluding
the LiLAC Corporate Costs) and certain other less significant entities.

    Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2015,
and operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2015.




                                                                  I-3
  Recent Developments

  Pending Acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications

     On November 16, 2015, we announced, pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the terms of
a recommended acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC) for shares of Liberty Global in a scheme of
arrangement. CWC offers integrated telecommunications-based services in over 40 countries located primarily in Latin America
and the Caribbean. Under the terms of the transaction, CWC shareholders will be entitled to receive up to, in the
aggregate: 31,651,616 Liberty Global Class A ordinary shares, 77,488,978 Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares, 3,648,524
LiLAC Class A ordinary shares and 8,939,328 LiLAC Class C ordinary shares. Further, CWC shareholders would be entitled to
receive a special dividend in the amount of £0.03 ($0.04) per CWC share at the closing of the transaction, which would be in lieu
of any previously announced CWC dividend. We expect that the dividend and estimated fees and expenses will be funded from
CWC liquidity, including incremental debt borrowings and LiLAC Group liquidity. Completion of the acquisition, which is expected
to occur during the second quarter of 2016, is subject to, among other conditions, Liberty Global and CWC shareholder approvals,
certain regulatory approvals and court sanction of the scheme of arrangement. In connection with the proposed acquisition, we
entered into an agreement with CWC to, among other things, provide our reasonable co-operation to CWC to complete the
acquisition. If the acquisition of CWC is not completed as expected, under certain limited circumstances, we could be required to
pay CWC a termination fee of $50 million.

     Following completion of the acquisition of CWC, we intend to attribute CWC to the LiLAC Group, with the Liberty Global
Group being granted an inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group. Based on the fully-diluted numbers of Liberty Global Shares,
LiLAC Shares and CWC shares outstanding on November 16, 2015, after giving effect to the acquisition and such attribution, and
treating Liberty Global Group’s inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group as being represented by additional LiLAC Shares, Liberty
Global Group shareholders would have had an approximate 67.4% ownership interest in the LiLAC Group.

  Acquisition of BASE

     On February 11, 2016, pursuant to a definitive agreement and following regulatory approval, Telenet acquired BASE Company
N.V. (BASE) for a purchase price of €1,324.4 million ($1,500.5 million at the transaction date). BASE is the third-largest mobile
network operator in Belgium. We expect that this acquisition will provide Telenet with cost-effective long-term mobile access to
effectively compete for future growth opportunities in the Belgian mobile market. Telenet financed the acquisition of BASE through
a combination of €1.0 billion ($1.1 billion) of new debt facilities and existing liquidity. On February 4, 2016, the European
Commission approved Telenet’s acquisition of BASE following Telenet’s agreement to divest both the JIM Mobile prepaid customer
base and BASE’s 50% stake in Viking Co NV to MEDIALAAN NV, which was announced in November 2015.

  Choice Acquisition

     On June 3, 2015, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with the parent of Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Company Inc.,
dba Choice Cable TV (Choice) and following regulatory approval, one of our subsidiaries, together with investment funds affiliated
with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, Searchlight), acquired 100% of Choice (the Choice Acquisition). Choice is
a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico. We acquired Choice in order to achieve certain financial, operational and
strategic benefits through the integration of Choice with Liberty Puerto Rico. The combined business is 60%-owned by our company
and 40%-owned by Searchlight.

    For additional information on the Choice Acquisition, including related financings, see notes 4 and 10 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, during 2015, we completed various other
smaller acquisitions and dispositions in the normal course of business.

  Financings

    •    Virgin Media Refinancings. On March 30, 2015, Virgin Media Secured Finance PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Virgin
         Media (Virgin Media Secured Finance), issued (1) $500.0 million principal amount of 5.25% senior secured notes due
         January 15, 2026 and (2) £525.0 million ($773.5 million) principal amount of 4.875% senior secured notes due January
         15, 2027. On April 30, 2015, Virgin Media Secured Finance issued $500.0 million principal amount of 5.25% senior
         secured notes due January 15, 2026, which were issued at 101% of par. The net proceeds from the foregoing senior secured
         notes were used to (a) redeem 10% of the principal amount of certain series of notes issued by Virgin Media Secured
         Finance in accordance with the indentures governing each of the notes and (b) prepay in full the outstanding principal
         amount of certain term loans under the senior secured credit facility of Virgin Media Investment Holdings Limited, a
         subsidiary of Virgin Media.

                                                               I-4
    •    2015 Reorganization Transactions. During the first quarter of 2015, we undertook the financing transactions described
         below in connection with certain internal reorganizations of our broadband and wireless communications businesses in
         Europe, (1) a controlling interest in UPC Broadband Ireland Ltd. and its subsidiaries was transferred from a subsidiary
         of UPC Holding to a subsidiary of Virgin Media (the UPC Ireland Transfer), with the remaining noncontrolling interest
         transferred to another subsidiary of Liberty Global outside the UPC Holding borrowing group and (2) Ziggo Services
         B.V. and its subsidiaries were transferred from a subsidiary of UPC Holding to Ziggo Group Holding (the Ziggo Services
         Transfer). UPC Holding used the cash consideration received in connection with the Ziggo Services Transfer and the
         UPC Ireland Transfer of over $2.0 billion to prepay in full the outstanding principal amount of certain notes, together
         with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium, as applicable, under the UPC Broadband Holding
         Bank Facility and to redeem in full certain senior notes. Then certain UPCB Finance entities, which are special purpose
         financing entities that are wholly-owned by a Dutch foundation, used the proceeds from the forgoing prepayments to
         redeem in full or in part the outstanding principal amount of their respective senior secured notes.

    •    Ziggo Refinancing. Ziggo Bond Finance B.V. (Ziggo Bond Finance) and Ziggo Secured Finance B.V. (Ziggo Secured
         Finance) are special purpose financing entities that are wholly-owned by a Dutch foundation. On January 29, 2015, Ziggo
         Bond Finance issued (1) $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and (2) €400.0 million ($434.6 million)
         aggregate principal amount of senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund Ziggo Group Holding’s credit
         facilities senior proceeds loans in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million and €400.0 million ($434.6 million),
         respectively, with a subsidiary of Ziggo Group Holding. On February 4, 2015, Ziggo Secured Finance issued €800.0
         million ($869.3 million) aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and used such proceeds to fund €800.0 million
         ($869.3 million) aggregate principal amount of a senior secured proceeds loan with a subsidiary of Ziggo Group Holding
         as borrower. The proceeds from each of the foregoing loans were ultimately used to redeem certain amounts outstanding
         under the notes described below under “UPCB Finance Refinancing” of this section.

    •    UPCB Finance Refinancing. UPCB Finance entities are special purpose financing entities that are wholly-owned by a
         Dutch foundation. During 2015, UPCB Finance IV Limited issued (1) $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of
         5.375% senior secured notes (2) €600.0 million ($652.0 million) aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and
         (3) an additional $340.0 million principal amount of 5.375% senior secured notes, the proceeds of which were used to
         fund UPC Facilities AL, AK and AL2, respectively. UPC Facility AL2 was subsequently merged with UPC Facility AL.
         The net proceeds from UPC Facility AL and UPC Facility AK were used to (1) prepay the remaining €190.0 million
         ($206.5 million) outstanding principal amount of UPC Facility Y, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related
         prepayment premium, (2) prepay the $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of UPC Facility Z, together with accrued
         and unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium, (3) prepay in full the then outstanding €600.0 million ($652.0
         million) amount under UPC Facility AI and (4) prepay 10% of the outstanding principal amount of each of UPC Facility
         AC and UPC Facility AD, each together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium. The
         UPCB Finance entities that received the forgoing prepayments used the proceeds therefrom to redeem in full or in part
         the outstanding principal amount of their respective senior secured notes.

     For a further description of the terms of the above financings and certain other transactions affecting our consolidated debt
in 2015, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Equity Transactions

    •    Share Repurchases. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, during 2015, we repurchased a total of 49,984,562 Liberty
         Global Class C ordinary shares and Old Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares at a weighted average price of $46.91
         per share, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $2,344.5 million, including direct acquisition costs and the effects of
         derivative instruments. The timing of the repurchase of shares pursuant to this program is dependent on a variety of
         factors, including market conditions. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases
         was $1,601.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, our board of directors increased this amount to $4.0 billion.

     For a further description of our share repurchases, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Narrative Description of Business

  Broadband Distribution

  Overview

     We offer a variety of broadband services over our cable distribution systems, including video, broadband internet and fixed-
line telephony and, in certain of our operations, we offer mobile services. We design these services to enable our customers to
access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer to customers is
“triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled services of digital video, internet and fixed-line telephony in one subscription.
We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to include mobile in most of our markets. Available service offerings depend
on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. In select markets,
we also offer video services through DTH or through multichannel multipoint (microwave) distribution systems (MMDS). Our
consumer brands include Virgin Media, Ziggo, Unitymedia, Telenet, UPC Cablecom, UPC, VTR and in Puerto Rico, Liberty. In
2016, we will use solely the UPC brand in Switzerland, discontinuing the UPC Cablecom brand. In terms of video subscribers,
we operate the largest cable network in each of Austria, Belgium, Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Poland, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Switzerland and the U.K. and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania.

     During 2015, we launched a comprehensive plan, which we call the Liberty 3.0 program, to drive our top-line growth while
maintaining tight cost controls. The Liberty 3.0 program seeks to capitalize on revenue opportunities associated with Network
Extensions (as defined below), mobile and business services, together with the realization of greater efficiencies by leveraging
our scale more effectively. Underpinning this program is a commitment to customer centricity, which we believe is key to succeeding
in an ever more demanding consumer market. We expect the transformation to occur over the next several years and, as with any
program of this magnitude, the benefits are expected to materialize over time. “Network Extensions” refers to network extension
programs pursuant to which we will connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network in the
U.K., Central and Eastern Europe, Germany, Chile and certain other markets. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.

___________________
 (1)    Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without
        materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH and MMDS homes. Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data
        that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. With respect
        to MMDS, one MMDS customer is equal to one Home Passed. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined
        below) used in Switzerland and the Netherlands (see note 11 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s and the
        Netherlands’ partner networks.

 (2)    Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way
        services, including video, internet and fixed-line telephony services.

 (3)    Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or fixed-line telephony services
        that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent
        that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (EBU) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship
        counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer Relationships
        generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary
        home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers
        from Customer Relationships.

  (4)   Revenue Generating Unit or RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, MMDS
        Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Fixed-line Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit
        may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our Austrian market subscribed to our enhanced video
        service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the
        sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, MMDS, Internet and Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on
        a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand,
        if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count
        as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or fixed-line telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless
        of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional
        service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge
        on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include
        subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2015 RGU counts exclude
        our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

  (5)   Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
        broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service
        that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or
        virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU
        basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as
        one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. In Europe,
        we have approximately 133,800 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive
        regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.

  (6)   Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
        broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that
        requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted
        on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises
        is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate
        customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our
        Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland and the Netherlands
        over partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations.

  (7)   DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast
        directly via a geosynchronous satellite.

  (8)   MMDS Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming via MMDS.

  (9)   Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks,
        or that we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude 53,000 digital subscriber line (DSL) subscribers
        within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from
        dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an
        incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 100,000 subscribers who have requested and received this
        service.

 (10)   Fixed-line Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our
        networks, or that we service through a partner network. Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our
        Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers exclude 41,300 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland,
                                                                   I-10
          we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony
          Subscribers in Switzerland include 57,200 subscribers who have requested and received this service.

  (11)    Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland and, to a much lesser extent, the Netherlands offer enhanced video, broadband internet
          and fixed-line telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (partner networks). A partner network RGU
          is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2015, Switzerland’s partner networks
          account for 139,500 Customer Relationships, 284,400 RGUs, 104,400 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 106,600 Internet Subscribers and
          73,400 Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers.

Additional General Notes to Table:

         Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business
         services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price
         to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or fixed-line telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass
         marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied
         by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband
         communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”.
         With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs
         for external reporting purposes.

         Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and
         commercial establishments, such as bars, hotels and hospitals, in Chile and Puerto Rico and certain commercial and residential multiple
         dwelling units in Europe (with the exception of Germany and Belgium, where we do not count any RGUs on an EBU basis). Our EBUs
         are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk
         residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely
         as a result of changes in rates. In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint, and two-way homes passed reflect the technological
         capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring
         generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term
         capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks.

         While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance
         sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform,
         (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We
         periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported
         on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those
         reviews.

         Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such
         information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.




                                                                       I-11
Residential Services

  •   Video. Our cable operations offer a full range of video services, including basic and premium programming, an electronic
      programming guide, high definition (HD) channels, HD receivers, digital video recorders (DVR) and HD DVRs. These
      services can be viewed on the television and, in most markets, through internet connected devices in the home and
      whenever there is internet connectivity. In certain markets, our advanced service offerings include video-on-demand
      (VoD) and advanced next generation set-top boxes like the multimedia home gateway “Horizon TV” or the “TiVo”
      service offered by Virgin Media in the U.K. or the “Digital TV” service with a Horizon-like user interface offered by
      Telenet in Belgium. These services, together with DVR and HD DVR functionality, give our customers the ability to
      control when they watch their programming. In several of our markets, we have enhanced pay-per-view programming
      on channels we distribute and through VoD. Several of our operations offer television applications (apps) that allow
      access to programming on a variety of devices, including laptops, smart phones and tablets through our online product,
      “Horizon Go”.

      Subscribers access our enhanced video service by renting a set-top box from our operators, or purchasing one and obtaining
      a conditional access security card, or a “smart card”, from our operators, or without a set-top box if a subscriber is only
      using our basic video service. Neither a set-top box nor a smart card is required to receive basic digital television channels
      in our unencrypted footprints. In some of our markets, instead of a set-top box, a subscriber may use a common interface
      plus (CI+) module in combination with a smart card to access our enhanced video services. A CI+ module is a small
      device (credit card size) that allows customers with a CI+ enabled television set, who subscribe to, or otherwise have
      access to, our enhanced video service, to view such services without a set-top box. No set-top box, smart card or CI+
      module is, however, required to receive our unencrypted basic digital services. Accordingly, subscribers with the necessary
      equipment and who pay a monthly subscription fee for our analog package are able to also receive our basic digital
      services. In addition, expanded channel packages and premium channels and services are available for an incremental
      monthly fee in all of our markets.

      Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video
      service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 60 digital or analog
      video channels (including a limited number of HD channels) and several digital and analog radio channels. This service
      also includes VoD access and an electronic programming guide. In our markets where our basic digital service is
      unencrypted, the cost of our digital service is the same cost as the monthly fee of our analog service. In the markets
      where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to or
      slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services in each country of operation
      based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings
      include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign
      channels. We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers.

      For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an
      increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD channels.
      Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge.
      For subscribers who want access to thousands of movies and TV series, we offer subscription VoD services, including
      our subscription VoD service “MyPrime”. MyPrime is available for an additional fee with our basic video services and
      is included in our enhanced video services with our Horizon TV platform (described below). MyPrime offers customers
      unlimited streaming access to a library of on-demand content both through our set-top boxes and through the Horizon
      Go platform. Each library has been tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and
      competitive offers. Generally, a library consists of approximately 20% movies, 55% TV episodes and 25% children
      episodes. The content is from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal,
      CBS/Paramount, BBC, Warner TV and Sony.

      In the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic, a subscriber to our enhanced video
      services also has the option for an incremental monthly charge to upgrade the standard digital set-top box to a Horizon
      TV box (which has HD DVR capabilities and other additional features). These boxes may be rented from us. In all our
      operations, except Romania and Slovakia, VoD services, including catch-up TV, are available on a subscription basis or
      a transaction basis, depending on the tier of enhanced video service selected by the subscriber. Customers who subscribe
      to an extended digital tier generally receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. The
      subscription-based VoD service includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports or series
      and a limited amount of 3D programming.



                                                              I-12
    In addition to our digital video services, we offer limited analog services in all of our broadband markets, except in the
    U.K., Switzerland and Puerto Rico. Subscribers to our analog video service typically receive 21 to 67 channels of video
    service, depending on their location. Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our
    analog service. In Ireland and Slovakia, we offer a limited number of video channels through MMDS. In all of our
    broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog
    subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service.

    Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services
    (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile services. Bundled services
    consist of “double-play” for two services, “triple-play” for three services and “quadruple-play” for four services.

    We offer digital video services through DTH satellite in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. We offer
    these services through UPC DTH S.á.r.l (UPC DTH), a subsidiary of UPC Holding organized in Luxembourg, which
    also has a management arrangement with another subsidiary, FocusSat Romania Srl (FocusSat), to provide these services
    in Romania. Similar to our video cable services, we offer a basic video tier of service and, for an additional monthly
    charge, subscribers may upgrade to an extended tier of service and may subscribe to various premium channel packages.

•   Interactive Services. To enhance our customers video experience, we offer Horizon TV in the Netherlands, Germany,
    Switzerland, Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic. Horizon TV is a next generation multimedia home gateway decoder
    box based on a digital television-platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and data content throughout the
    home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view and share, across
    multiple devices, linear channels, VoD programming and personal media content and to pause, replay and record
    programming. The Horizon TV platform can act as an internet router that allows access through the gateway box to the
    digital video content available on the television via other devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets. It also
    integrates access to personal media content, such as photos, music and movies stored in the home network.

    For our multimedia gateway customers, we also offer various features and functionalities. We intend to (1) expand the
    availability of Horizon TV to other markets within our footprint and (2) continue to improve the Horizon TV user
    experience with new functionality and software updates. In 2015, we launched our new “Replay TV” service in the
    Netherlands and Ireland and expanded this service in Switzerland. This service allows our customers to go back seven
    days in the electronic programming guide to “replay” linear programming they have missed. Using the Horizon Go app,
    customers can watch programs from the past seven days on their laptops, smart phones or tablets. Replay TV is also
    available to our Digital TV customers in Belgium. We expect to expand the availability of Replay TV to additional markets
    during 2016.

    For our Horizon TV subscribers, we offer apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Picasa and others). The
    Horizon family of products also includes an online television app for viewing on a second screen called Horizon Go that
    allows video customers to view linear channels, with many channels available outside of the home. Horizon Go also
    offers access to VoD and, for Horizon TV customers, when in the home, the second screen devices also act as a remote
    control. Subscription VoD, such as MyPrime and, in Germany, Maxdome, is also available via the Horizon Go service.
    We also have available through Horizon Go the ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on the
    Horizon TV box at home through an iOS or Android mobile digital device or an internet web browser.

    At December 31, 2015, we had 1,759,000 Horizon TV subscribers, excluding 174,000 subscribers in the Czech Republic
    where we have upgraded their set-top box to provide Horizon TV services. The Horizon TV cloud platform allows users
    to stream experiences to set-top boxes. This cloud-based Horizon TV platform is available in the Czech Republic and in
    Poland. Digital video experiences are offered by us through the TiVo platform in the U.K. under a strategic partnership
    agreement with TiVo Inc. The TiVo boxes provide converged television and broadband internet capabilities. The digital
    platform, Digital TV, is also available to our enhanced video subscribers in Belgium, which has been upgraded with a
    new Horizon-like user interface and improved functionalities. At December 31, 2015, we had 2,897,000 TiVo subscribers
    and 1,714,000 subscribers to Telenet’s Digital TV.

    In addition, we offer our regular interactive DVR and, as described above, MyPrime. Where the Horizon TV platform
    service is not available, MyPrime is offered as a premium channel for non-Horizon TV subscribers. We have launched
    MyPrime in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

•   Broadband Internet. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service in all of our broadband communications
    markets. Depending on location, this service includes download speeds ranging from less than 1 Mbps to an ultra high-
    speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. In general, our most economically
    priced tier has download speeds of either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps. Our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily
                                                          I-13
    on Euro DOCSIS 3.0 technology, which is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission
    over a cable system. Euro DOCSIS can deliver speeds of up to 1 Gbps. We are currently testing Euro DOCSIS 3.1 and
    expect to begin commercial deployment of that system in late 2016.

    Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. We also offer value-added broadband
    services through certain of our operations for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus,
    anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. In certain of our markets, we
    offer mobile broadband services as described under —Mobile below.

    Our residential subscribers generally access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices,
    including personal computers, at various speeds depending on the tier of service selected. This standard means of access
    is changing as we expand our services to offer wireless networks for the home, such as Horizon TV. In certain of our
    markets, we are deploying a community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides a secure
    access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem)
    in the set-top box or the Horizon TV box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing
    of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. The public channel is a separate network from
    the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is
    installed. Access is free for our internet customers.

    At December 31, 2015, we had almost 6.1 million WiFi access points in our European footprint and we plan to increase
    our WiFi access points to over 10.0 million in 2016. In the U.K., Virgin Media’s customers have access to an extensive
    network of public WiFi access points, including in the London underground train stations. Public WiFi access points are
    also available to Unitymedia customers in Germany and Telenet customers in Belgium. We plan to expand our Community
    WiFi service in 2016. Our Community WiFi is branded as “Wi-Free” in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Ireland, Czech
    Republic, Poland, Hungry and Romania and as “WifiSpots” in the Netherlands. Through an agreement with Comcast
    Corporation, in 2016 our internet customers will also have access to millions of WiFi access points in the U.S. and across
    various European countries for no additional costs.

    We have introduced a next generation WiFi and telephony gateway in the U.K., Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and
    Romania. This gateway includes both a data modem and a WiFi router and will permit download speed of up to 1 Gpbs
    across our existing Euro DOCSIS 3.0 platform and is expected to support Euro DOCSIS 3.1. It has an automatic WiFi
    optimization function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-
    installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. It will be introduced in the rest of our operations
    in 2016. By using the WiFi modems, the Horizon TV box and the new gateway, the Community WiFi does not affect the
    internet speeds of our customers.

    In the Netherlands and Romania, a subscriber must subscribe to our video service (or the video service in a partner
    network) in order to subscribe to our internet service. In our other markets, our broadband internet service is available
    on a standalone basis or in combination with one or more of our other services. Subscribers to our internet service pay
    a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service
    fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine
    pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors.

•   Telephony. Multi-feature fixed-line telephony services are available through our managed, quality of service based voice-
    over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in all of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K., Chile and Hungary,
    we also provide traditional circuit-switched fixed-line telephony services. We pay interconnection fees to other telephony
    and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers
    when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points.

    Our fixed-line telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets
    in combination with one or more of our other services. Our fixed-line telephony service includes a basic fixed-line
    telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network,
    national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile
    phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third
    phone line at an incremental cost. In some of our markets, we offer a phone app that allows our fixed-line telephony
    customers with smart phones to use their fixed-line call packages.

•   Mobile. We offer mobile services, both data and voice, as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Germany,
    the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and Chile. In Poland, we have a small legacy MVNO
    service that we maintain for those subscribers. In the Netherlands, Switzerland and Chile, our mobile services are provided
                                                          I-14
         through LTE wireless systems. We plan to add MVNO arrangements in certain of our other broadband communication
         markets. The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and Chile provide their mobile telephony
         services as full MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints.
         All of these operations lease the third party’s radio access network and own the core network, including switching,
         backbone, interconnections, etc. For certain portions of our mobile customer base in the Netherlands, we outsource the
         core network to a third party. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets all mobile services
         without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. Following the February 2016 acquisition of BASE,
         Telenet became a network provider in Belgium and plans to migrate its current and future mobile subscribers to the BASE
         network after termination of its MVNO agreement at the end of 2017.

         In the U.K. and Germany, we provide mobile telephony as light MVNOs. In these countries, we lease the core network
         as well as the radio access network from a mobile network operator. These arrangements permit our customers in these
         countries to have access to the third party mobile communications services while we maintain the customer relationship.
         We offer our mobile services throughout the U.K., Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and Chile. In the
         Netherlands and Germany, we offer our mobile service to our customers located within our footprints who subscribe to
         at least one of our other products: video, broadband internet or fixed-line telephony. At December 31, 2015, we had
         approximately 4.8 million mobile subscribers.

         Where mobile services are available within our operations, subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether
         the mobile service is included with our fixed-line telephony service or includes mobile data services via mobile phones,
         tablets or laptops. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in the U.K., Belgium and
         Switzerland, make such purchase pursuant to a contract independent of their mobile services contract. Where the new
         WiFi gateway described above is available, telephony customers can use a special phone app to take and make calls
         anywhere at home rates. Versions of this app have been available to our customers in the U.K., the Netherlands, Belgium,
         Switzerland and Ireland for some time.

         We typically charge a one-time activation fee to our customers for each subscriber identification module (SIM) card.
         Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and
         out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily
         on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract
         to up to 24 months, with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium, however, our postpaid
         service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K., we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers
         pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost
         all of our markets, subscribers to a double-or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee.

  Business Services

     In addition to our residential services, we offer a range of voice, broadband internet, data, video, wireless and cloud services
to business customers and public sector organizations. These services differ from residential services in several fundamental ways,
such as bandwidth, service levels, billing, security services and the blending of public and private network features. Our business
customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and medium and large enterprises, as well as on a
wholesale basis to other operators. Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers
with a wide range of services, including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into
five broad categories: (1) VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options,
(2) data services for internet access, virtual private networks Ethernet transport and high capacity point-to-point services, (3) video
programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries, (4) wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well
as WiFi networks and (5) value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled
software.

     Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of
services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market
prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more
advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers,
we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of one or more years.
In addition to providing business services over our networks, certain of our operations also have agreements to provide these
services to our business customers over dedicated fiber lines and third party fiber networks.




                                                                 I-15
  Technology

     In almost all of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid
fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to
the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. Approximately 98% of our network allows for two-way
communications and is flexible enough to support our current services, as well as new services. In addition, the capacity available
on our network increases as our analog subscribers switch to a digital service. This is because multiple digital channels can be
compressed into the same space as a single analog channel in the broadcast spectrum. The available space can then be used for
other purposes, such as VoD services and high broadband speeds.

     We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for
instance by splitting nodes in our network. We also continue to explore new technologies that will enhance our customer’s
connected entertainment experience, such as:

    •    recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:

                   increasing the number of nodes in our markets and using digital compression technologies;

                   increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;

                   converting analog channels;

                   bonding additional Euro DOCSIS 3.0 channels; and

                   using digital compression technologies;

    •    increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to the
         cloud;

    •    enhancing our network to accommodate business services;

    •    using wireless technologies to extend our services outside the home;

    •    offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets; and

    •    expanding the availability of Horizon TV and related products and developing and introducing online media sharing and
         streaming or cloud based video.

    In addition, we are expanding our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network into new market areas. For example, beginning in 2015,
we commenced a Network Extension program in the U.K. and we plan to pursue similar opportunities in Germany, Central and
Eastern Europe and Chile. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
—Overview.

    We are also testing Euro DOCSIS 3.1 and expect to begin commercial deployment of that system in late 2016.

    We deliver our high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our cable network. The cable networks of our operations are
connected to our “aorta” backbone, a tier 1 carrier, that permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration
with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network.

  Supply Sources

    For our video services, we license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-
party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee
on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with minimum pay guarantees in certain cases. We generally enter into long-term
programming licenses with volume discounts and marketing support. For on-demand programming and streaming services, we
generally enter into shorter-term agreements. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed
programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets.

     We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers
for our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, CI+ modules, DVRs, tuners and
similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we
use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers
for mobile handsets to offer customers in our operations with mobile services. For our mobile services, we are dependent on the
                                                              I-16
MVNO arrangements we have entered into with third-party wireless network providers that offers mobile services to carry our
mobile communications traffic. Each of our operations offering mobile services has an agreement with a provider for its customers.
In each case, we seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services.

     We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers
for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software licenses and a share
of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where TiVo is
the exclusive provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provide converged television
and broadband internet capabilities, and we are the exclusive distributor of the TiVo services and technology in the U.K. For our
fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of
suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the
services.

    TV customers for no additional charge. In late 2015, Virgin Media-Ireland launched its mobile services as an MVNO
    and it launched Replay TV.

•   Unitymedia. Unitymedia’s operations in Germany are located in the German federal states of Baden-Württemberg, North
    Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse and include the major cities of Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe,
    Mannheim, Stuttgart and Wiesbaden. Unitymedia offers triple-play services consisting of video, internet and fixed-line
    telephony services in nearly all of its footprint. Unitymedia also offers quadruple-play services that include mobile voice
    and data services as an MVNO through an arrangement with a mobile communications provider. Unitymedia customers
    have access to an extensive network of public WiFi hotspots.

    For its video cable customers, Unitymedia offers Horizon TV, an HD receiver and a CI+ module. At December 31, 2015,
    Unitymedia had almost 460,000 connected Horizon TV subscribers. No set-top box, CI+ module or smart card is, however,
    required to receive basic digital services because Unitymedia’s basic digital service is unencrypted in its German footprint.
    In addition, Horizon Go is available, giving subscribers access to over 100 linear channels of which over 80 channels,
    plus subscription VoD programming, may be accessed outside the home. Unitymedia also offers the subscription VoD
    service Maxdome, which is available via the internet on the television or on mobile devices via the Horizon Go app. In
    addition to its premium video offerings, through an agreement with Sky Deutschland AG, a subsidiary of Sky (Sky
    Deutschland), Unitymedia offers its subscribers premium video channels from Sky Deutschland. Unitymedia subscribers
    may receive Sky Deutschland channels for an incremental subscription fee through a smart card on the Unitymedia
    network.

    Approximately two-thirds of Unitymedia’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia has the
    billing relationship with the landlord or housing association or with a third party (Professional Operator) that operates
    and administers the in-building network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements allow Unitymedia
    to offer its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the end customer. Professional
    Operators may procure the basic video signals from Unitymedia at volume-based discounts and will generally resell them
    to housing associations with whom the operator maintains the customer relationship. Unitymedia has entered into
    agreements with Professional Operators, such as Tele Columbus Multimedia GmbH, that allow Unitymedia to market
    its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the Professional Operator’s subscriber
    base.

    Unitymedia has entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche
    Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom), for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as use of fiber optic transmission
    systems, towers and facility space. In addition, Unitymedia purchases a portion of the electricity required for the operation
    of its networks through Deutsche Telekom under such agreements. Unitymedia’s ability to offer its broadband
    communications services to customers is dependent on the agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are
    long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions. Any termination, however, would have a material
    adverse effect on the operations of Unitymedia. For information on a legal action that Unitymedia commenced against
    Deutsche Telekom in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•   Ziggo. Ziggo’s operations in the Netherlands are located throughout most of the Netherlands and include the major cities
    of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Maastricht. Ziggo offers video, internet, fixed-line telephony and
    mobile services as an MVNO.

    Digital subscribers may subscribe to premium channels, including HBO, Film1, Ziggo Sport Totaal (includes six sport
    channels), Fox Sports International and the premium football league channel, Fox Sports Eredivisie, alone or in
    combination, for additional monthly charges. VoD services, including catch-up television, are available on a subscription
    or a transaction basis, depending on location and the tier of digital service selected by the subscriber. VoD services are
    also available to CI+ users. A subscription-based VoD service is included in the extended digital tier for no additional
    charge. The transaction VoD service includes over 3,000 titles of on-demand content.

    Horizon TV and its products are available to customers as are apps on the gateway device that provide access to various
    internet services, such as YouTube and Facebook. At December 31, 2015, Ziggo had over 700,000 connected Horizon
    TV subscribers. Ziggo offers its customers a cloud-based interactive television service using existing set-top boxes. By
    combining IP protocol with the standard set-top box, devices without built-in hardware functionality for interactivity can
                                                           I-22
    make use of interactive services through the Ziggo cable network. Also available is a CI+ module that enables subscribers
    to Ziggo’s digital video service to view such service without a set-top box and use a single remote control. To utilize this
    service, Ziggo customers must have a CI+ enabled television and obtain the CI+ module and smart card from Ziggo. In
    2015, Ziggo launched its Ziggo Sport channel, which is available exclusively to Ziggo customers.

•   Belgium. The Telenet operations in Belgium attributed to the Liberty Global Group are conducted under the Telenet
    brand. At December 31, 2015, we owned 56.9% of Telenet’s outstanding ordinary shares. Telenet offers quadruple-play
    services consisting of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile voice and data services, primarily to
    residential customers in the Flanders region and approximately one-third of the city of Brussels. In addition, pursuant
    to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium
    (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes
    its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs.

    Telenet’s premium video channels include general entertainment, sports (including non-exclusive broadcasting rights for
    the domestic football league), documentary, foreign language, kids, music, adult and movies. Telenet’s enhanced video
    customers get access to Yelo Play. Yelo Play allows Telenet’s enhanced video customers to remotely manage their DVR,
    view programs remotely (up to seven days after the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or
    tablet in the home and out of the home. At December 31, 2015, approximately 26% of its enhanced video customers were
    actively using Yelo Play. Telenet also offers a CI+ module for an incremental monthly charge to access its encrypted
    digital service.

    Telenet has an extensive network of Community WiFi across its footprint, branded “Wi-Free”. The Community WiFi
    provides free WiFi access to its customers who are traveling within its footprint. Telenet has nearly 1.3 million access
    points to the Community WiFi as of December 31, 2015, including approximately 2,000 public hotspots covering train
    stations, bars, hotels and similar public places. In addition, Telenet offers, individually and as a bundle, fixed-line
    telephony services over its network and mobile telephony services as a full MVNO under the “Telenet Mobile” brand
    name.

    Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant
    to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease.
    Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the
    case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet).

•   UPC CHAT. UPC CHAT operates a cable network in Switzerland and cable and DSL networks in Austria under the UPC
    Cablecom (until spring 2016) and UPC brands (collectively, UPC CHAT). The DSL services are provided over an
    unbundled loop or, in certain cases, over a shared access network, and available in the majority of Austria wherever the
    incumbent telecommunications operator has implemented DSL technology. UPC CHAT’s operations are located in 24
    of the 26 member states (Cantons) of Switzerland, including major cities such as Bern, Zürich, Lausanne and Geneva,
    and in regional clusters in Austria encompassing the capital city of Vienna, the regional capitals of Graz, Innsbruck and
    Klagenfurt, two smaller cities and the Vorarlberg region. Three of the cities in Austria (Vienna, Wr. Neustadt and Baden),
    directly or indirectly, own 5% of the local operating subsidiary of UPC CHAT serving the applicable city.

    UPC CHAT offers mobile voice and data services as an MVNO. UPC CHAT no longer offers analog service in Switzerland;
    however, customers in Austria with the necessary equipment and who subscribe to UPC CHAT’s analog service are also
    able to access its basic digital service, which is unencrypted in the Austria. A CI+ module or set-top box in combination
    with a smart card is, however, required to view any of UPC CHAT’s encrypted digital packages with the customer paying
    the incremental charge over the digital entry tier’s applicable rate.

    Switzerland. UPC CHAT’s basic video service in Switzerland is available in any one of three languages (French, German
    or Italian). It offers the basic video service as a triple-play package consisting of video, broadband internet and fixed-
    line telephony services, plus an app to use the fixed-line telephony service on a smart phone. UPC CHAT offers Horizon
    TV and its family of products and, at December 31, 2015, it had 295,000 connected subscribers. UPC CHAT also offers
    apps that allow its subscribers to remotely manage a DVR, view linear channels, replay a linear channel without recording
    it and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or tablet anywhere a broadband or WiFi connection is available. In each of
    its digital cable packages in Switzerland, UPC CHAT includes the functionality for transaction-based VoD service
    (depending on location), including catch-up television, pay-per-view services and HD channels. Fully integrated in the
    VoD service is the video library MyPrime. MyPrime is included in the extended digital tiers for no additional charge.




                                                           I-23
    For two-thirds of its video subscribers in Switzerland, UPC CHAT maintains billing relationships with landlords or
    housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers
    the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units.

    UPC CHAT offers digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers
    of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC CHAT. UPC CHAT has the direct customer
    billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC CHAT to offer some or all of its digital video, broadband
    internet and fixed-line telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC CHAT’s service operating
    contracts have expanded the addressable markets for UPC CHAT’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide
    digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC CHAT pays to the partner network a share of the revenue
    generated from those subscribers. UPC CHAT also provides network maintenance services and engineering and
    construction services to its partner networks.

    Austria. UPC CHAT’s video service (digital and analog) in Austria is available primarily in the German language. Its
    premium packages include ethnic channels (such as Serb, Bosnian and Turkish channels), music, adult and international
    channels. In addition, through an agreement with Sky Deutschland, UPC CHAT offers its digital subscribers in Austria
    a number of premium channels, including HD channels, from Sky Deutschland. UPC CHAT offers its broadband internet
    service over cable and over DSL. In 2016, UPC CHAT plans to expand its services in Austria to include the subscription
    VoD service MyPrime.

•   Central and Eastern Europe. UPC CHAT also operates cable networks under the UPC brand in Poland (UPC Poland),
    Hungary (UPC Hungary), the Czech Republic (UPC Czech), Romania (UPC Romania) and Slovakia (UPC Slovakia).

    in Poland. UPC Hungary, UPC Poland and UPC Romania have each launched apps for no charge to subscribers that
    permit them to view the digital channel programming guide, schedule DVR recordings from any location and use their
    smart phones as a television remote control. Except in Slovakia where its basic digital service in encrypted, customers
    with the necessary equipment and who have a monthly subscription to the analog service are also able to access the basic
    digital service, which is unencrypted. The Liberty Global Group also has attributed to it DTH operations in most of these
    countries, which is provided through UPC DTH. Community WiFi is available in each of these countries, except Slovakia,
    with approximately1.6 million access points in Central and Eastern Europe.

         Community WiFi is available to its customers in Plaza Las Americas, a major shopping center in San Juan.

Competition

     The markets for video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are highly competitive and rapidly
evolving. In addition, technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase the
number of alternative providers available to our customers. Consequently, our businesses have faced and are expected to continue
to face significant competition in these markets in the countries in which they operate and specifically, as a result of deregulation,
in the European Union (EU). The percentage information in this section reflects the data for each country regardless of the extent
of our footprint in such country and is as of the date of the relevant sources listed in the following sentences. The percentage
information provided below for the various countries is based on information from the subscription based website DataXis for the
third quarter of 2015. The competition in certain countries in which we operate is described more specifically after the respective
competition overview on video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services.

  Video Distribution

   Our businesses compete directly with a wide range of providers of communication and entertainment services to consumers.
Depending upon the country and market, these may include:

    •      traditional FTA broadcast television services;

    •      DTH satellite service providers;

    •      other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including the incumbent telephony operators
           offering (a) DTH satellite services, (b) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or very high-
           speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (c) IPTV over fiber optic lines where
           the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is
           referred to herein as FTTx), or (d) long-term evolution wireless service, the next generation of ultra high-speed mobile
           data, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services;

    •      over-the-top video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections;

    •      digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasters, which transmit digital signals over the air providing a greater number
           of channels and better quality than traditional analog broadcasting;

    •      other cable operators in the same communities that we serve;

    •      satellite master antenna television systems, commonly known as “SMATVs”, which generally serve condominiums,
           apartment and office complexes and residential developments;

    •      MMDS operators; and

    •      movie theaters, video stores, video websites and home video products.

    Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online
entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events.




                                                                I-26
     We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages in the areas served by our network.
For instance, our cable network allows us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD
content, without impairing our high speed internet service than comparable services of other providers. In addition, our cable
infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services
without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Our capacity is dimensioned to support peak consumer demand. In
serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business
demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. In response to the
continued growth in over-the-top viewing, we have launched a number of innovative video services, including Horizon Go,
MyPrime and Replay TV.

  Liberty Global Group

     In the European countries in which we operate, over 90% of the households have a television. Our principal competition in
the provision of video services in our European markets has historically been from traditional FTA broadcasters; DTH satellite
providers in many markets, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Ireland, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where we
compete with long-established satellite platforms; incumbent telecommunications providers using fiber technology; and cable
operators in various markets where portions of our systems have been overbuilt. In addition, in Belgium we expect we will
experience competition on own network as a result of the Belgian Regulatory Authorities granting third-party operators (including
the incumbent telephony operator) access to cable operators’ networks. See Regulatory Matters—Europe—Belgium. Mobile
broadband has gained a noticeable share of subscribers, and competition from SMATV or MMDS could also be a factor. In
addition, over-the-top viewing is a competitive factor. Overall, we are experiencing more and more convergence as customers
are increasingly looking to receive all their media and communication services from one provider at attractive prices. As a result,
our ability to offer triple-play or quadruple-play bundles is a key marketing concept to continue to attract and retain customers.

     Over the last several years, competition has increased significantly from both new entrants and established competitors using
advanced technologies, aggressively priced services and exclusive channel offerings. Our competitors are also improving their
video platforms with next generation set-top boxes. DTT is a significant part of the competitive market in Europe as a result of
a number of different business models that range from full blown encrypted pay television to FTA television. Similarly, VDSL,
which is either provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third party, is a significant part of the competitive environment
in many of our markets as are FTTx networks. In all of our European markets, competitive video services are offered by the
incumbent telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include IPTV over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and in some
cases DTH and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services and, in some countries, a quadruple-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations,
including the pricing and bundling of our video products. The providers of DTH satellite services, particularly in our markets in
the U.K., Germany and Central and Eastern European, are also significant competitors. In addition, over-the-top video aggregators
are active in all our markets with their VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from
broadcasters. In some cases, these over-the-top services are provided free-of-charge, or the content library of such services are
offered on an unlimited basis for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices and in and out of the
home. With consumers’ desire to view content when and where it suits them, the ability to meet such demand through our TV
everywhere products is key to our competitive position.

     Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and
services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors,
such as Swisscom AG (Swisscom) in Switzerland, have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain sports programs, which
limits the opportunities for other providers, including our operations, to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained
long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have access to certain of such programming through select contracts
with these companies, including Sky Deutschland in Germany and Austria and Sky in the U.K. and Ireland. If exclusive content
offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video
service.

    Portions of our systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks in the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, the
Netherlands and Switzerland. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and internal estimates, our cable networks in several of our operations have
been overbuilt by FTTx networks as follows: Ziggo--30%, UPC CHAT-Switzerland--36%, UPC Czech--65%, UPC Hungary--13%,
UPC Romania--92% and UPC Slovakia--74%. Although we have extensive FTTx overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the
FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition, government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries
in which we operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx networks, creating another source of competition. In order to achieve
download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators are increasingly adopting
VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives. Vectoring is a

                                                                 I-27
transmission method that coordinates line signals to reduce crosstalk levels and improve performance. Bonding is a method of
taking channels on either DSL or cable plant and bond those channels together for a higher bandwidth throughput.

     Our Central and Eastern European markets are also experiencing significant competition from other cable operators. These
cable operators have significantly overbuilt our operations in Poland and Hungary and to a lesser extent in Romania and Slovakia.
Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including the OECD and internal estimates, approximately 49%
and 51% of our operations in Poland and Hungary, respectively, are overbuilt by other cable providers. Also, approximately 10%
in each of our footprints in Romania and Slovakia is overbuilt by other cable providers.

     In most of our Central and Eastern European markets, we also face intense competition from DTH services. In addition to
overbuilding portions of our cable network in Hungary and Romania, Digi TV, the DTH platform of RCS & RDS S.A. (Digi TV),
a Romanian cable, telephony and internet service provider, is targeting our analog cable and DTH customers with aggressively-
priced DTH packages. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, “SkyLink”, the brand name of M7 Group SA, a European provider
of DTH services, is a DTH competitor providing aggressively-priced packages of video content. The incumbent telecommunications
operator, Telekom Romania Communications S.A., in Romania also operates a competing DTH platform. UPC DTH offers
advanced services and functionality, including DVR and premium content, to most of our Central and Eastern European markets.
UPC DTH’s share of the subscription-based television market is 8% for Hungary, 5% for the Czech Republic, 4% for Slovakia
and, through FocusSat, 5% for Romania.

    In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger
markets have been pricing their DTT, VDSL or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital
cable service and, in some cases, including DVRs as a standard feature.

     To meet the challenges in this competitive environment, we compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as
DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television, Replay TV, multiscreen services and multi-media gateways. We seek to compete
by accelerating the migration of our customers from analog to digital services, using such advanced digital features and offering
attractive content packages and bundles of services at reasonable prices. In each of our countries we also tailor our packages to
include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts. In addition, from time
to time, digital channel offerings are modified by our operations to improve the quality of our programming. In all of our operations,
we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged
across the portfolio of services. In several of our markets, we have expanded our services to include mobile voice and data. We
also continue to explore new technologies that will enhance our customer’s television experience. In this regard, to further enhance
our digital video services, we launched our next generation multimedia home gateway Horizon TV to meet our customers desire
to view programming anytime and anywhere. We continue to update Horizon TV with new applications and expand its availability
in our markets, including the recent launch of a cloud-based Horizon TV platform in the Czech Republic.

    •    Virgin Media-U.K. Virgin Media-U.K. is the sole provider of video cable services in substantially all of its network area
         and, in terms of the number of video cable customers, the largest cable television provider in the U.K. Virgin Media’s
         video cable services are available to approximately 48% of the U.K. television households and it serves 14% of the total
         U.K. television market. Virgin Media-U.K.’s digital television services compete primarily with those of Sky, which is
         the primary pay satellite television platform in the U.K. Sky has approximately 10.2 million subscribers in the U.K., or
         38% of the total television market. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk),
         each of which offer IPTV services in the U.K. BT (which is acquiring Everything Everywhere Limited (EE), a British
         mobile network provider, in early 2016), and Sky have also launched next-generation set-top boxes and compete with
         Virgin Media-U.K. for consumers seeking bundled services.

         Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a
         principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels,
         including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and
         online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms.
         Virgin Media-U.K. distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal
         competitor and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports
         content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League
         and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available over BT’s IPTV platform, via BT’s apps and online
         players, Sky’s satellite system and our cable network. In addition, FTA DTT and internet-connected television services
         are a competitive factor. For example, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google and Apple have all launched over-the-top products
         in the U.K.

         In this competitive market, Virgin Media-U.K. is expanding its broadband network and, in 2015, realigned its triple-play
         bundles and upgraded TiVo set-top boxes to include storage and display of personal photos, videos and music and catch-
                                                                I-28
    up services. It also offers Virgin TV Anywhere, which allows its video subscribers to stream linear channels and access
    certain VoD content anywhere with WiFi connectivity. In addition, Virgin Media-U.K.’s ability to include mobile for a
    low incremental fee creating a quadruple-play bundle is a key market offer.

•   Virgin Media-Ireland. Virgin Media-Ireland is the sole provider of video cable services in Ireland. Virgin Media-Ireland’s
    video cable service is available to over half of the television households in Ireland and it serves 23% of the total television
    market. Virgin Media-Ireland’s primary competition for video customers is also from Sky, which provides DTH satellite
    services to 41% of the television households in Ireland. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play services and
    promotional discounts for new customers. Virgin Media-Ireland also faces competition from Eircom Limited (Eir), which
    also offers triple-play services, as well as an IPTV video service, and smaller video providers, including providers using
    FTTx networks. To enhance its competitive position, Virgin Media-Ireland offers Horizon TV, MyPrime and Replay TV
    and, at the start of 2016, increased its download internet speed to 360 Mbps for its mass market double- and triple-play
    bundles.

•   Unitymedia. Unitymedia is the second largest cable television provider in Germany and the largest cable television
    provider in the federal states of Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse based on the number of video
    cable subscribers. Unitymedia’s video cable services are available to approximately 33% of the television households
    in Germany and it serves 17% of the total television market. Unitymedia’s primary competition is from FTA television
    received via satellite. Unitymedia’s primary competitor for pay TV services is the IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx
    and DTH of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has over 2.6 million
    video subscribers in Germany, or 7% of the total television market, for primarily its IPTV services and has announced
    plans to cover approximately 80% of German homes with its VDSL network by 2018. We estimate Deutsche Telekom
    will have overbuilt nearly our entire network with VDSL by the end of 2016. Within parts of its VDSL footprint, Deutsche
    Telekom started to implement vectoring technology, enhancing maximum broadband speeds to up to 100 Mbps from the
    current speeds of up to 50 Mbps. Deutsche Telekom further announced its ambition to have implemented super vectoring
    technology across all cable network areas by 2018, enhancing broadband speeds in these areas to up to 250 Mbps.

    Deutsche Telekom offers competitively-priced triple-play bundles and promotional discounts for new customers. In
    addition, Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche
    Telekom’s DSL network under a resell agreement making it a significant competitor in the double-play and triple-play
    market in our footprint. Both of these companies have expanded their bundle offers to include mobile products. These
    converged offerings may enable Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to reduce churn and attract new customers.

    Deutsche Telekom and Professional Operators compete with Unitymedia for housing association contracts. Over the last
    few years, Deutsche Telekom has become increasingly competitive in this market. Professional Operators typically
    procure the broadcast signals they distribute from Unitymedia or from FTA television received via satellite. Certain
    Professional Operators may also use such opportunities to build their own distribution networks or to install their own
    head-ends for receiving satellite signals.

    Other alternative distributors of television services are an increasing threat as well. To a lesser extent, Unitymedia
    competes with Sky Deutschland’s digital premium subscription service to households that receive their basic television
    service via FTA satellite, cable or other technologies. Over-the-top content providers are also creating competitive pressure,
    including the on-line video streaming services of Sky Deutschland and the services of ProSiebenSAT.1 Media AG’s
    Maxdome, Netflix and Amazon Prime. In addition, there is a risk of competition for video services from commercial
    broadcasters and other content providers that currently pay Unitymedia fees for transmitting their signals, but may seek
    to diversify their distribution on alternative platforms such as over-the-top video through high-speed internet connections.

    To enhance its competitive position, Unitymedia offers Horizon TV and the Horizon family of products, including Horizon
    Go. To attract customers to its double- and triple-play bundles, Unitymedia has realigned its promotional offers. It also
    makes mobile available creating converged bundles. Mobile customers receive a discount when they also subscribe to
    certain bundles.

•   Ziggo. Ziggo is the largest cable television provider in the Netherlands based on the number of video cable subscribers.
    Ziggo’s video cable services are available to approximately 92% of the television households in the Netherlands and it
    serves 54% of the total television market. Ziggo experiences most of its competition in the Netherlands from other fixed-
    line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including the incumbent telecommunications operator
    Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (a) IPTV over FTTx networks, (b) IPTV through broadband internet
    connections using DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (c) DTT and (d) LTE services. KPN
    provides subscription video services to 29% of the total television households in the Netherlands. Its ability to offer
    bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony services and a quadruple-play with mobile services, places

                                                            I-29
    significant competitive pressure on Ziggo’s operations. KPN’s VDSL service includes VoD and DVR functionality, catch-
    up television, replay television and second screen viewing. In addition, KPN has launched its own over-the-top video
    service. Portions of our network have also been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks, and expansion
    of these networks is expected to continue. Another principal competitor in the provision of video services is from the
    DTH provider CanalDigitaal, a subsidiary of M7 Group S.A. CanalDigitaal, which offers DTH and DTT services, provides
    subscription video services to 11% of the total television households in the Netherlands.

    To improve its competitive position, Ziggo introduced new portfolios for its double- and triple-play offers. For an
    incremental fee, customers may also include mobile voice and data to any bundle package. The bundle options give
    subscribers the option to select various combinations of services, including high-speed internet, fixed-line telephony
    options and content options, to meet their needs. Also, Ziggo’s extended digital video tiers include Horizon TV, Replay
    TV and MyPrime. Horizon Go is also available. In addition, Ziggo continues to improve the quality of its programming
    and modify its video options by offering attractive content packages. For example, in November 2015, it launched Ziggo
    Sport, its new exclusive sports channel, which Ziggo added to all existing video packages for no additional charge.

•   Telenet. Telenet is the sole provider of video cable services in its network area and the largest cable television provider
    in Belgium. Its video cable service is available to approximately 62% of the television households in Belgium and it
    serves approximately 43% of the total television market. Telenet is the largest subscription television provider in Belgium
    based on the number of pay video subscribers. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus NV/SA (formerly Belgacom
    NV/SA) (Proximus), the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay
    television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service. Proximus also offers double-
    play and triple-play bundles and discounts on mobile services when taken with a triple-play offer. Approximately 29%
    of total television households in Belgium subscribe to Proximus’ IPTV services over its DSL and VDSL networks. Also,
    with the decision that Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable
    networks, Telenet will be facing increased competition from other providers of video services who may then be able to
    offer triple- and quadruple-play services as well. For more information, see Regulatory Matters—Europe—Belgium. In
    order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet uses its Digital TV platform, together with its extensive
    cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and its extensive additional features, such as
    HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings and its Play Sports channel. In addition, Telenet continues to enhance its Yelo
    Play app and programming, including extending its rights to the English Premier League through 2018 and the addition
    of other sports rights. Further, with its acquisition of BASE, Telenet will be able to expand its quad-play options for
    customers.

•   UPC CHAT-Switzerland. UPC CHAT is the largest cable television provider in Switzerland based on the number of
    video cable subscribers and the sole provider in substantially all of our network area. UPC CHAT’s video cable services
    are available to approximately 64% of the television households in Switzerland and it serves 39% of the total television
    market. Our main competitor is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services
    over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks to approximately 37% of all television households in Switzerland. Swisscom offers
    VoD services, DVR functionality and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services,
    and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom is targeting our customers with its introduction
    of an ultra HD set-top box in early 2016. The set-top box will support HD and ultra HD content with plans to broadcast
    the Super League football (soccer) in ultra HD during the 2016-17 season. It is also updating its user interface to improve
    its other interactive services. Swisscom’s internet speeds available in its bundled offers, include up to 100 Mbps on its
    VDSL network and up to either 300 Mbps or 1 Gbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to
    aggressively expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network
    footprints. It has built its fiber-to-the-home network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility
    companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own fiber-to-the-home
    network. By the end of 2015, approximately 1.0 million homes and businesses in Switzerland have access to Swisscom’s
    FTTx network.

    Due to a small program offering, competition from terrestrial television in Switzerland is limited, with DTT available
    primarily along the borders with France and Italy. DTH satellite services are also limited due to various legal restrictions,
    such as construction and zoning regulations or rental agreements that prohibit or impede installation of satellite dishes.
    Over-the-top providers are, however, increasing the competitive pressure on video viewing offers. With respect to
    subscribers on partner networks, UPC CHAT competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these
    subscribers.

    To compete effectively in Switzerland, UPC CHAT promotes Horizon TV and its family of products together with replay
    television and MyPrime, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences. It has

                                                           I-30
    also increased the internet speeds for all its bundle customers, including a speed of up to 500 Mbps for its top extended
    digital tier bundles.

•   UPC CHAT-Austria. In Austria, UPC CHAT is the largest cable television provider based on the number of video cable
    subscribers. UPC CHAT’s video cable service is available to approximately 38% of the television households in Austria
    and it serves 14% of the total television market. UPC CHAT’s primary competition in Austria is from FTA television
    received via satellite and DTT services by the public broadcaster. Competition from the VDSL services provided by the
    incumbent telecommunications operator, Telekom Austria AG (A1) (Telekom Austria), and from DTH satellite services
    offered by Sky Deutschland, also continue to increase. At various times, Telekom Austria offers promotional discounts
    for its VDSL service, which includes advanced features, such as VoD, when taken as part of either a double- or triple-
    play bundle. It also launched a video streaming service in 2015. To compete effectively, UPC CHAT realigned its bundle
    offers in 2015 and includes HD DVR in its extended digital video tiers. Horizon Go is also available and its top triple-
    play bundle includes internet speeds of up to 250 Mbps. To compete with over-the-top providers, including Telekom
    Austria, UPC CHAT is exploring offering its own video streaming service.

•   Central and Eastern Europe. UPC Poland is the largest cable television provider in Poland based on the number of video
    cable subscribers. In 2015, UPC Poland expanded its services to a number of markets, including five new cities, resulting
    in UPC Poland’s video cable services being available to approximately 21% of the television households in Poland. It
    serves 9% of the total television market. In providing video services, UPC Poland competes primarily with DTH service
    providers, including the largest DTH providers, Cyfrowy Polsat SA and NC+ platform (owned by the Vivendi Group),
    as well as Orange Poland, a subsidiary of France Telecom S.A. UPC Poland also competes with the IPTV services of
    Orange Poland, which is expanding its DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks, including to households in UPC Poland’s
    footprint. UPC Poland competes with other cable operators with triple-play services, who have overbuilt portions of UPC
    Poland’s operations. To enhance its competitive position, UPC Poland enhanced its sports channel offerings, realigned
    its portfolio of services and, for its extended tiers of bundle services, increased internet speeds and added MyPrime
    services. It also launched the Horizon TV cloud platform throughout its footprint and Horizon Go is also available.

    UPC Hungary’s video cable service is available to over 40% of the television households in Hungary and it serves 17%
    of the total television market in Hungary. Our subsidiary, UPC DTH, also provides satellite services in Hungary, in
    competition with other DTH providers. One of these, Digi TV, is an aggressive competitor. Digi TV has also overbuilt
    portions of UPC Hungary’s cable service areas with its own cable network. As a DTH provider, Digi TV offers more HD
    channels, including key sports channels, than UPC DTH. In its cable foot print, Digi TV offers a competitively priced
    quad-play bundle. UPC Hungary also faces competition from the IPTV services of the incumbent telecommunications
    company Magyar Telekom, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. To meet such competition, UPC Hungary emphasizes its
    competitively priced bundles, which have higher broadband speeds of up to 500 Mbps with up to 120 Mbps or 240 Mbps
    included in its core bundle offers. Its extended digital video tiers include MyPrime and, for its HBO customers, the on-
    line streaming service HBO Go. For DTH customers in Hungary, UPC DTH launched a triple-play offer in November
    2015. Of the television households in Hungary, 7% subscribe to Digi TV’s DTH service, 16% subscribe to Digi TV’s
    cable service and 26% subscribe to Magyar Telekom’s DTH or VDSL service. UPC DTH serves 8% of the television
    households in Hungary with its DTH service.

    With the discontinuation of FTA analog services in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, DTH services have increased
    significantly in popularity, with SkyLink being the main provider. This company provides DTH services to approximately
    27% and 31% of the television households in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, respectively. As in Hungary, Digi TV
    is also an aggressive competitor in the Czech Republic and Romania. Digi TV provides DTH services to 5% and 11%
    of the television households in the Czech Republic and Romania, respectively. In Slovakia, we compete with the DTH
    service provider, Slovak Telekom a.s., a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, which offers exclusive sports channels and is
    expanding its DTH network to cover not only Slovakia but other Central and Eastern European countries as well. In
    Slovakia, it serves 23% of the television households. UPC DTH provides DTH services to 3%, 5% and 3% of the television
    households in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, respectively. To stay competitive, UPC DTH offers prepaid
    DTH services in the Czech Republic, as well as a prepaid product through FocusSat in Romania. Also, FocusSat has
    enhanced the channel offering in Romania, including the addition of non-exclusive broadcasting rights for domestic
    football league. In Romania, competition also comes from DTH services offered by Telecom Romania, the incumbent
    telecommunications company, with 17% of the total television households.

    Of the television households in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, 10%, 12% and 8%, respectively, subscribe
    to our video cable service. Our cable services are available to the television households in each of these countries as
    follows: 31% in the Czech Republic, 37% in Romania and 22% in Slovakia. In addition to its DTH services in Romania,
    Digi TV continues to overbuild large portions of our cable network with its own cable network. Of the television households
    in Romania, 37% subscribe to Digi TV’s cable service. Telekom Romania is also expanding its FTTx network. Both of
                                                          I-31
         these competitors offer quad-play bundles. UPC Czech competes with the incumbent telephone company’s VDSL service
         and several other operators that provide DTH services and a number of local internet service providers (ISPs) that provide
         IPTV services over FTTx networks. Providers of IPTV services over FTTx networks can reach approximately 65% of
         the households passed by our cable network in the Czech Republic. One of these companies is O2 Czech Republic, which
         has its own sports channel with exclusive rights in Multidimension and covers Champions Leaque, Czech football (soccer)
         and similar sporting events. In Slovakia, a number of ISPs make video services available to a majority of the homes
         passed by our cable networks. In particular, Slovak Telekom and Orange Slovensko a.s., a subsidiary of France Telecom
         S.A., have overbuilt homes passed by our cable network with their FTTx networks and offer triple-play packages through
         these networks.

         FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. Subscribers in these countries
         tend to be more price sensitive than in other European markets. In particular, almost 100% of the Czech Republic can
         receive DTT for free or a comprehensive satellite service for a minimal recurring monthly fee. To address such sensitivity
         and meet competition, our operations in Central and Eastern Europe offer enhanced digital services, such as HD channel
         offerings and, in certain markets, MyPrime, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. In addition, all of these operations
         have realigned their portfolio offers to include additional HD channels. These operations have also increased broadband
         internet speeds in their triple-play bundles ranging from up to 300 Mbps in the Czech Republic to 500 Mbps in Hungary,
         Romania and Slovakia. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options. Also, CI+ cards for DTH
         only products are available in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.

  LiLAC Group

     In Latin America, our principal competition is the provision of video services from DTH satellite providers, where we compete
with established satellite platforms, as well as other pay television providers. Over-the-top viewing is also a competitive factor.
To enhance the video offerings in both Chile and Puerto Rico, we are in the process of developing cloud-based, next generation
user interfaces for these operations based on advanced technologies, including Horizon TV.

    •    VTR. In Chile, VTR is the largest cable television provider based on number of video cable subscribers. VTR’s video
         cable services are available to approximately 60% of the Chilean television households and it serves 20% of the total
         television market in Chile. VTR competes primarily with DTH service providers in Chile, including the incumbent
         Chilean telecommunications operator Compañia de Telecomunicaciones de Chile SA using the brand name Movistar
         (Movistar), Claro Chile S.A., a subsidiary of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (Claro), and DIRECTV Latin America
         Holdings, Inc. (DirecTV). Movistar offers double-play and triple-play packages using DTH for video and DSL for
         internet and fixed-line telephony and offers mobile services. On a smaller scale, Movistar also offers IPTV services over
         FTTx networks in Chile. Claro offers triple-play packages using DTH and, in most major cities in Chile, through a hybrid
         fiber coaxial cable network. It also offers mobile services. To a lesser extent, VTR also competes with video services
         offered by or over networks of fixed-line telecommunication providers using DSL technology. Of the Chilean television
         households, 13%, 6% and 10% subscribe to the video services of Movistar, Claro and DirecTV Chile, respectively. To
         effectively compete, VTR offers VoD, catch-up television, DVR functionality, premium HD channels, pay-per-view, HD
         receivers and a variety of premium channels as value added services that can be purchased by VTR’s video cable customers.
         These services and its variety of bundle options, including internet and telephony, enhance VTR’s competitive position.
         In addition, in order to provide its customers greater viewing options, VTR intends to launch Horizon TV in 2016.

    •    Liberty Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico is the largest provider of video cable services in Puerto Rico and the third
         largest provider of video services in Puerto Rico. Its video cable service is available to approximately 87% of the television
         households in Puerto Rico and it serves 22% of the total television market in Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico’s primary
         competition for video customers is from DTH satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network Corporation. These
         competitors provide DTH satellite services to 27% and 25%, respectively, of the television households in Puerto Rico.
         Dish Network Corporation is an aggressive competitor, offering low introductory offers, free HD channels and, in its top
         tier packages, a multi-room DVR service for free. DirecTV is also a significant competitor offering similar programming
         in Puerto Rico compared to Dish Network. Additionally, Claro has launched an IPTV service, but it has not yet become
         a significant competitive factor. In order to compete, Liberty Puerto Rico has increased the number of its HD channels,
         launched a Spanish language tier, improved the functionality of its electronic program guide and expanded its VoD
         offerings. In 2015, Liberty Puerto Rico increased its internet speeds in its bundle offers with download speeds of up to
         200 Mbps in its core bundles.

  Internet

   With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving
marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many
                                                                 I-32
of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet
services using DSL or FTTx and wireless broadband internet services, in a range of product offerings with varying speeds and
pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With technological
developments, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies has become significant. Recently,
competitors have started offering high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks in certain of our markets. In addition, other
wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are becoming more prevalent.

     Our strategy is speed leadership, including increasing the maximum speed of our connections, offering varying tiers of service,
prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and packages on an
on-going basis to meet the needs of our customers, including offering download internet speeds of 120 Mbps or more at mass
market price points. Ultra high-speed internet is also available in most markets, with speeds of up to 250 Mbps, with speeds of
up to 500 Mbps available in Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. In early 2016, Virgin Media-Ireland, Unitymedia and
VTR each increased their top tier speed to 360 Mbps, 400 Mbps and 160 Mbps, respectively. The focus continues to be on high-
end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-
end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of Euro DOCSIS 3.0 technology, we can compete with
local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level.
With the expected commercial deployment of Euro DOCSIS 3.1 in late 2016, we plan to further increase our high-speed internet
offers.

  Liberty Global Group

     Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various
DSL-based technologies by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-
line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE,
are also taking a foothold in a number of countries using high-speed mobile networks.

     United Kingdom and Ireland. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet
services. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest, serving 34% of the total market in the U.K. Virgin Media serves
20% of the total broadband market in the U.K. BT provides broadband internet access services over its own, VDSL network, which
is available to approximately 85% of the U.K. population. BT Openreach, a division of BT, manages BT’s local access network
and provides competitors access to BT’s networks. BT has announced its intention to rollout ultrafast speeds of up to 300 Mbps
to 500 Mbps by the end of 2020 to up to 10.0 million premises using G-fast technology, a DSL standard designed for local loops
less than 250 meters. This technology is also expected to eventually support a rollout of 1 Gbps service.

     Operators such as Sky, TalkTalk and EE deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known
as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing the
proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital investment to
implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition and pricing pressure
in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE mobile services and
WiFi services, is increasing.

      Virgin Media-U.K. is expanding its ultra high-speed services and increasing its download speeds to up to 200 Mbps throughout
its footprint. Virgin Media-U.K. offers its internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that include video,
fixed-line telephony and mobile voice and data services at attractive price points. Promotional discounts are available for new
customers.

     Mobile providers have gained market share throughout Europe. In Ireland, mobile telephony providers Vodafone Ireland,
Three Ireland (a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holding Ltd) and Meteor Mobile Communications Limited, a subsidiary of Eir, offer
a range of mobile internet products at competitive prices. Outside of mobile internet, Virgin Media-Ireland’s most significant
competitor is also Eir, the fixed-line incumbent, with 39% of the broadband internet market in Ireland. Eir offers download speeds
of up to 100 Mbps through its expanded VDSL network, which passes approximately 1.4 million homes. In addition, as part of
its bundle offers, Eir makes available download speeds of up to 1 Gbps in select markets, covering less than 2% of Irish homes,
but plans to expand this service. Virgin Media’s share of total broadband internet subscribers in Ireland is 32%. To compete
effectively, Virgin Media-Ireland realigned its bundles, including increasing the download speed of its internet services to up to
240 Mbps in 2015 and to up to 360 Mbps at the start of 2016. It also introduced a SIM-only mobile product in late 2015 and
expects to launch LTE in 2016.

     Germany. In Germany, the competition for broadband internet services is particularly intense. For broadband internet access,
DSL is the dominant technology and Deutsche Telekom is the primary provider. Other major competitors to our services are
resellers of Deutsche Telekom’s DSL and VDSL services, including United Internet AG and alternative network providers, such
                                                               I-33
as Vodafone Germany and Telefónica Germany Holding AG (Telefónica Germany). Deutsche Telekom provides services to 42%
of the broadband internet subscribers in Germany through its network. United Internet AG and Vodafone Germany provide DSL
services to 14% and 9%, respectively, of the broadband internet subscribers in Germany. We also face increased competition from
mobile broadband operators, including Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone Germany and Telefónica Germany, each of which offer
mobile services through LTE wireless systems. Both Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone Germany are upgrading their mobile systems
and increasing their coverage areas. Deutsche Telekom has started upgrading its VDSL network with vectoring technology to
increase its speeds to up to 100 Mbps. It plans to have 80% of German households connected to this network by 2018. With its
(vectored) VDSL expansion plan, competition from Deutsche Telekom will increase.

     Unitymedia serves 10% of the total broadband internet market in Germany. To compete effectively, Unitymedia expanded
its ultra high-speed internet services and increased its download speeds to up to 200 Mbps and, in February 2016, launched
download speeds of up to 400 Mbps in over 40% of its footprint. These download speeds cannot be matched by DSL operators.
Unitymedia offers its internet service on a standalone basis or together with fixed-line telephony at attractive rates and through
bundled offerings that include digital video and fixed-line telephony. Unitymedia also offers mobile voice and data services.

     The Netherlands. With high internet access penetration, competition in the Netherlands internet market is intense. We face
competition primarily from KPN, one of the largest broadband internet providers, and to a lesser extent, the telecommunications
company, Tele2 Netherlands Holding N.V., as well as operators using wholesale access on KPN’s fixed network. KPN offers ultra
high-speed internet services with download speeds of up to 500 Mbps on its FTTx network and up to 100 Mbps over its VDSL
or FTTx network. KPN is the leading mobile broadband provider with its competitively priced mobile internet products and LTE
services. KPN and other competitors in both fixed-line and wireless broadband internet services offer a range of services with
varying speeds, as well as interactive computer based services, data and other non-video services. KPN serves 42% and Ziggo
serves 43%, respectively, of the total broadband internet market in the Netherlands. To remain competitive, Ziggo seeks to increase
the maximum speed of its connections, offers varying tiers of service, prices and bundled product offerings and a range of value
added services. Ziggo is also expanding its mobile data services, including access to its Community Wifi. The bundle strategies
include offering ultra high-speed internet with speeds of up to 200 Mbps to compete with KPN’s VDSL and FTTx initiatives.
Ziggo offers its internet service on a standalone basis or together with digital video or with digital video and fixed-line telephony
as bundles. It also offers mobile voice and data services.

     Belgium. In Belgium, internet access penetration is higher than in most European markets causing intense competition between
the two primary broadband internet technologies, cable and DSL. In Flanders, Telenet is the leading provider of residential
broadband internet services. Telenet’s primary competitor is the DSL service provider Proximus. Proximus is an aggressive
competitor targeting Telenet customers through quadruple-play offerings and a low-cost broadband service. Approximately 45%
of Belgium’s broadband internet subscribers use Proximus’ DSL and VDSL service with download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Mobile
internet use is increasing. Similar to its video services, Telenet will be facing competition in the provision of internet services
from other providers who have access to Telenet’s cable network.To compete, Telenet promotes its high-speed internet with
multiple-play bundles, offering download speeds from 30 Mbps to 200 Mbps with all new bundled broadband internet customers
receiving download speeds of at least 100 Mbps. Customers also have access to Telenet’s extensive Community WiFi. Telenet
provides broadband internet service to 38% of the broadband internet market in Belgium.

     UPC CHAT. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, with an estimated market share
of 54% of all broadband internet customers, and is our primary competitor. Swisscom internet customers have access to its video
content free of charge through its internet portal. It is also expanding its FTTx network, through which it can offer download
speeds of up to 1 Gbps offer to customers on its new FTTx network. Swisscom’s FTTx network reaches approximately 1.0 million
homes. The next significant competitor is Sunrise Communications AG with 9% of broadband internet customers. Through third-
party FTTx networks, Sunrise Communications AG offers download speeds of up to 100 Mbps, as well as a 1 Gbps offer for its
high-end customers. In Switzerland, UPC CHAT serves 21% of the broadband internet subscribers. It offers download speeds of
up to 200 Mbps and, for its Horizon TV subscribers, up to 500 Mbps. The internet service is available either on a standalone basis
or through a bundle offer. UPC CHAT seeks to distinguish itself through competitively priced bundled offerings, including digital
video, fixed-line telephony services and its ultra high-speed internet services. It is also expanding its Community WiFi network
in Switzerland.

     In Austria, UPC CHAT’s largest competitor with respect to broadband internet services is the incumbent telecommunications
company, Telekom Austria, with approximately 61% of the broadband internet subscribers in Austria. Telekom Austria is expanding
its DSL network. It also plans to use G-fast technology and VDSL technology with vectoring to increase its download speeds.
Currently, Telekom Austria offers download speeds of up to 30 Mbps and up to 100 Mbps in select areas. UPC CHAT’s share of
such market is 20%. The mobile broadband services of Telekom Austria are also a significant competitive factor. Telekom Austria
is the largest mobile broadband provider serving 41% of the mobile broadband subscribers that use LTE services. In addition,
UPC CHAT faces competition in Austria from LLU and other mobile broadband operators. As a result, the competition in the

                                                                I-34
broadband internet market is intense. Competitors in the Austrian broadband internet market are focusing on speed and pricing
to attract customers. UPC CHAT uses its ultra high-speed internet services with access to Community WiFi and competitively
priced bundles to encourage customers from other providers to switch to its services in Austria. It also offers promotional discounts
and, in 2015, launched a portfolio of mobile voice and data services.

     Central and Eastern Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe, our principal competitors are DSL operators and cable companies
that are overbuilding our cable network. In Poland, our principal competitors are Orange Poland, Multimedia Polska S.A. and
Vectra S.A., with top download speed offers ranging from up to 100 Mbps to 500 Mbps in parts of UPC Poland’s footprint. In
Hungary, the primary competitors are the incumbent telecommunications company, Magyar Telekom and Digi TV. Where Digi
TV’s cable is available, its download speeds range from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps for its top tier of service. In addition, in all of our
Central and Eastern European operations we face increased competition from mobile broadband operators. Download speeds are
also a competitive factor, with competitors enhancing their networks to increase their available download speeds. In this competitive
environment, we are using our ultra high-speed internet service to attract and retain customers. In addition, promotional discounts
are a big part of our internet service offerings, as well as with our competitors.

  LiLAC Group

     Chile. In Chile, VTR faces competition primarily from the non-cable-based internet service providers, such as Movistar, and
from other cable-based providers, such as Claro. VTR is experiencing increased pricing and download speed pressure from
Movistar and Claro and more effective competition from these companies with the bundle of their internet service with other
services. Movistar offers ultra high-speed internet services with download speeds of up to 150 Mbps over portions of its DSL
network. Mobile broadband competition is significant as well. Both Movistar and Claro have launched an LTE network for high-
speed mobile data. Movistar is also the leading mobile broadband provider with its competitively priced mobile internet products
and LTE services. Movistar serves 40% and VTR serves 37%, respectively, of the total broadband internet market in Chile. To
compete effectively, VTR is expanding its two-way coverage and offering attractive bundling with fixed-line telephony and digital
video service. In response to the availability of mobile data in Chile, VTR offers its high-speed internet with download speeds of
up to 120 Mbps and up to 160 Mbps in early 2016.

     Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, Liberty Puerto Rico competes primarily with mobile broadband providers. Most of these providers,
including the incumbent telecommunications company, offer these services over their LTE networks. To compete with mobile
broadband, Liberty Puerto Rico offers its high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 200 Mbps. Liberty Puerto Rico also
competes with the DSL services of Claro in providing fixed-line internet services.

  Fixed-Line Telephony and Mobile Services

     The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and
quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. With respect to fixed-line telephony
services, our businesses compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in each country. These operators have
substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote to the provision
of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, we compete with other VoIP operators
offering service across broadband lines and with mobile telephony providers, many of whom offer LTE services and are making
significant advances in obtaining customers. Over-the-top telephony is also becoming a competitive factor. In many countries,
our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers.

     Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends,
the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth
of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other regulatory action, such as general price
competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using
the incumbent’s network. Our telephony strategy is based on value leadership. In most of our countries we offer our telephony
services as “anytime” or “any destination”. In addition, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers
to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. We also offer varying plans to meet customer needs
and use our telephony bundle options, as well as our bundle service options with our digital video and internet services, to help
promote our telephony services. In addition, we offer mobile voice and data services in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Chile, Poland, Hungary and Ireland. With consumers increasingly moving towards mobile services,
we continue to explore opportunities to offer mobile services in our other operations and mobility applications to our other services.




                                                                I-35

     Across Europe, our fixed-line and mobile telephony businesses are generally small compared to the existing business of the
incumbent telephone company. The incumbent telephone companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators and other
VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets. Generally, we expect
telephony markets to remain extremely competitive.

     Our fixed-line telephony strategy in Europe is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime”
or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers.
Such options include unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including
calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also use our bundled offerings to help promote our telephony services.

     In the U.K., we compete primarily with BT in providing fixed-line telephony services to residential customers in the U.K.
BT occupies an established market position as the former state provider. We also compete with other telecommunications companies
that provide fixed-line telephony services directly, through LLU, or indirectly. These include TalkTalk and Sky and mobile telephone
operators, such as EE and Vodafone who lease access to BT’s network to operate their LTE services. In addition, we face competition
from companies offering VoIP services using the customer’s existing broadband, mobile data and WiFi connections. For our mobile
service in the U.K., we also face competition from these mobile network operators as well as other MVNOs. EE is the largest
mobile service provider in terms of the number of mobile subscribers in the U.K. Its U.K. network reaches 98% of the U.K.
population with further expansion expected in 2016. Virgin Media is responding to such competition through innovative calling
plans and a WiFi application that allows customers to use their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. It offers flexible mobile
service contracts that allow customers to change services monthly and has increased its WiFi access points. Virgin Media’s share
of the fixed-line telephony market in the U.K. is 15%.

     Deutsche Telekom is the dominant fixed-line telephony provider in Germany; however, telephony services provided through
alternative technologies and mobile telephony services have caused competition in the telephony market to be intense. As a result,
the market for residential telephony service is price sensitive. In recent years, fixed-line phone calls have been transformed into
a commodity and have become increasingly dependent on a quality broadband offering, as phone is increasingly bundled with
broadband internet services. Fixed-line telephony has experienced significant price erosion over the last few years, with operators
increasingly offering flat-rate products. We seek to compete based on the speed of our network connections, pricing and product
innovation. We also offer varying plans to meet customer needs and various bundled service options with our digital video and
broadband internet services. The market share of the fixed-line telephony market for Unitymedia is 8%.

    In the Netherlands, KPN is the dominant fixed-line telephony provider and expanded its mobile services with its LTE network,
which is available throughout the Netherlands. All of the large multiple system operators, including Ziggo, as well as ISPs, offer
VoIP services. Ziggo entered the mobile market as an MVNO in September 2013. The market share of the fixed-line telephony
market for Ziggo is 38% compared to 51% for KPN. In the mobile market, Ziggo is small compared to the competition with less
than 1% of the market.

     In Belgium, competition in providing fixed-line residential telephony service is intense, with providers introducing substantial
price reductions over the years. Proximus is the dominant fixed-line telephony provider with 63% of the fixed-line telephony
market. It is also a significant competitor in the mobile telephony market, with its LTE services. Although Proximus is a significant
competitor, it also provides certain services to Telenet’s customers, including number portability and connect calls by Telenet
customers to Proximus customers. To gain market share, Telenet emphasizes customer service and provides innovative plans to
meet the needs of its customers, such as a flat fee plan offered in our bundle options (free off-peak calls to fixed-lines in Belgium,
plus 2,000 minutes for calls to mobile in Belgium, fixed and mobile in Europe, the U.S. and Canada, and fixed in Morocco and
Turkey). Subscribers to its fixed-line telephony service may also make free off-peak calls to mobile lines in Belgium, Europe,
the U.S. and Canada. Telenet also offers competitively priced mobile telephony that include a wealth of voice minutes, text messages
and mobile data. Telenet competes with other fixed-line operators and with mobile operators, including Proximus, in the provision
of telephony and mobile services in Belgium. Telenet’s share of the fixed-line telephony market in Belgium is 26%.

     In Switzerland, Swisscom is the dominant fixed-line telephony service provider. Sunrise Communications AG, which offers
carrier pre-select services, is also a strong competitor. Each of these competitors also operate their own mobile telephony service
and include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. In Switzerland, we serve our subscribers with VoIP over our
cable network, and in Austria, we serve our subscribers with VoIP over our cable network, circuit-switched telephony services
and DSL technology service over LLU. To meet the competition for fixed-line services in Switzerland, UPC CHAT enhanced its
portfolio with attractive bundle options as well as standalone plans with free minutes either nationally or internationally and offers
mobile services, including a phone app that allows smart phone users make calls on their fixed network plan. The market share
of the fixed-line telephony market for UPC CHAT in Switzerland is 12%.

                                                                I-36
     In our other European markets, the incumbent telephone companies dominate the telephony market. Most of the fixed-line
competition to the incumbent telephone operators in these countries is from entities that provide carrier pre-select or wholesale
line rental services. We also compete with ISPs that offer VoIP services and mobile operators. Given the increased relevance of
the mobile market, we recently launched mobile services as an MVNO in Austria and Hungary and plan to expand our MVNO
services to our other markets. To gain market share, we promote our VoIP telephony service offerings in almost all of our European
markets and, in some markets, we have enhanced our telephony services through unlimited calling options.

     In Chile, VTR faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications operator, Movistar, and other telecommunications
operators. Movistar has substantial experience in providing telephony services, resources to devote to the provision of telephony
services and long-standing customer relationships. Competition in both the residential and business telephony markets is increasing
as a result of market trends and regulatory changes affecting general price competition, number portability and the growth of VoIP
services. VTR offers circuit-switched and VoIP telephony services over its cable network. VTR’s share of the residential and
commercial fixed-line telephony market in Chile is 20%.

     In Chile, over 60% of telecommunications consumers use a mobile service, prompting us in 2012 to add wireless plans to
our services. Claro, Movistar and Entel PCS Telecommunications SA are the primary companies that offer mobile telephony in
Chile. Competition in the Chilean mobile services market is intense. As an MVNO, VTR offers its mobile telephony services on
a standalone basis. To attract and retain customers, VTR focuses on its fixed-line telephony customer base, offering them postpaid
accounts at an attractive price. In mid-2015, WOM S.A. entered the mobile services market through its acquisition of the Nextel
Chile network. WOM S.A. is exerting significant competitive pressure in the mobile market with its very aggressive and attractive
price offer. Such pricing is driving down sales and increasing churn in the mobile market. The mobile services of VTR represent
less than 1% of the mobile telephony market in Chile, of which approximately 91% are postpaid accounts. Of these customers
78% subscribe to at least one fixed-line VTR service.

Regulatory Matters

  Overview

    Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in
which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in
European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the EU.

     Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed
on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and
the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In
addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions,
interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties.
Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

  Liberty Global Group

     Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the EU. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain of their
laws with certain EU rules. In addition, other EU rules are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at
the national level. Certain EU rules are also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the EU
Member States (excluding Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

    In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive EU-level legislative action. As a result, most of
the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been
developed by the EU. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the EU and is not part of the European Economic
Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulation in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may
have a material impact on our business.




                                                               I-37
  EU Communications Regulation

     The body of EU law that deals with communications regulation consists of a variety of legal instruments and policies
(collectively, the Regulatory Framework). The key elements of the Regulatory Framework are various legal measures, which
we refer to as the “Directives”, that require Member States to harmonize their laws, as well as regulations that have direct effect
without any specific adoption at the national level.

     The Regulatory Framework primarily seeks open communications services markets within Europe. It harmonizes the rules
within the EU for the establishment and operation of electronic communications networks, including cable television and traditional
telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communications services, such as telephony, internet and, to some degree, television
services.

     On December 18, 2009, the Official Journal of the EU published revisions to the Regulatory Framework. These revisions
should have been transposed into the laws of the Member States before May 25, 2011, although in practice, this process is still
ongoing in certain Member States. Despite their limited nature, certain changes to the Regulatory Framework will affect us. For
example, some new powers have been given to national regulators, such as the right to mandate access to ducts without finding
operators or service providers to have “Significant Market Power” (defined below). This power, in particular, could require us to
open our ducts to competitors and not allow us to make use of all capacity in our ducts for our own needs, or could mean we get
access to ducts of third parties instead of building our own ducts. Additionally, the revisions to the Regulatory Framework grant
enhanced powers to Member States to impose transparency obligations and quality of service requirements on ISPs, which may
restrict our flexibility in respect of our broadband services.

     Certain key provisions included in the current Regulatory Framework are set forth below. This description is not intended to
be a comprehensive description of all regulation in this area.

    •    Licensing and Exclusivity. The Regulatory Framework requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication
         networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple registration. The
         Regulatory Framework sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and
         services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of
         regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations,
         provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations.

    •    Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Regulatory Framework apply only to operators or
         service providers with “Significant Market Power” in a relevant market. For example, the provisions of the Access
         Directive allow EU Member States to mandate certain access obligations only for those operators and service providers
         that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For purposes of the Regulatory Framework, an operator or service
         provider will be deemed to have Significant Market Power where, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a
         position of significant economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of
         competitors, customers and consumers.

         As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Regulatory Framework, each Member State’s National
         Regulatory Authority (NRA) is required to analyze certain markets predefined by the EU Commission to determine if
         any operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. The EU Commission has currently recommended that
         there be four such predefined markets, which is subject to periodic review. NRAs might, however, continue to maintain
         their analysis of some of the markets from the previous list or perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation,
         which requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met.

         NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power in any of these predefined markets or they may define
         and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market,
         an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Regulatory Framework, the EU Commission has the power
         to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect
         to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by the EU Commission or an additional
         market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate
         and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible. In particular, we have been found to have Significant
         Market Power in the termination of calls on our network.

    •    Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by
         the Regulatory Framework. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable
         must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are
         required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, proportionate and transparent and subject to periodic

                                                                I-38
         review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all European markets in which we operate. In some cases, these
         obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable under the Regulatory Framework. To date, the EU Commission has
         taken very limited steps to enforce EU law in this area, leaving must carry obligations intact in certain Member States
         that are in excess of what we believe to be allowed, and we do not expect the EU Commission or the Member States to
         curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.

    •    Net Neutrality/Traffic Management. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the Regulation on the first EU-
         wide net neutrality regime. The Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States beginning on April 30,
         2016, permits the provision of specialized services, optimized for specific content, and subjects operators to reasonable
         traffic management requirements. The Regulation also abolishes roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017 and provides
         for a transitional period beginning in April 2016. We expect that the Body of European Regulators for Electronic
         Communications (BEREC) will issue guidelines in the second half of 2016.

     On May 6, 2015, the EU Commission published its Digital Single Market strategy document. The strategy is an aggregation
of many different policy areas with the purpose of creating a digital single market to expand jobs and stimulate growth. The
strategy includes policy review in the areas of EU communications regulation, broadcasting law, copyright reform and anti-
competitive geo-blocking practices.

     The first legislative proposal under the strategy was adopted in December 2015 with publication of a proposed Regulation to
address the portability of online audiovisual content services. Under the proposal, providers of online audiovisual content services
must allow subscribers who are temporarily present in any EU Member State to access and use those services. The intention of
the proposed Regulation is for subscribers to be able to enjoy the same out-of-home service in another Member State. Political
negotiations on the draft Regulation will take place during 2016, and we expect the Regulation to be adopted by in EU Member
States in early 2017.

  EU Broadcasting Law

     Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Regulatory Framework, the activities
of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of EU law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS).
Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an EU Member State must respect the laws of that Member
State. Pursuant to AVMS, however, EU Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in
another EU Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their
home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to
non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we should be able, if we so elect, to offer our own VoD services across the European
Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could structure our business to have a single
regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our
network, it should be the business of the third-party, in its capacity as provider of the services, and not us as the local distributor,
that is regulated in respect of these services.

    Although Member States were obligated to transpose the requirements of AVMS into national law, and this has generally been
completed, the practical effect is still not clear. Uncertainty still remains about the proper treatment of VoD from a practical
perspective. Thus, there can be no assurance that the requirements for VoD will operate in the manner described above in any
individual Member State. As a result, we may face inconsistent and uncertain regulation of our VoD services in Europe.

    AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European
producers who are independent of broadcasters.

  Other European Level Regulation

     In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our European operating companies must comply with both
specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention and electronic commerce. In December 2015, the
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was approved with respect to data protection and retention, enhances existing
legal requirements, creates a multitude of new rules, and sets out stiff penalties for organizations that fail to comply. The GDPR
will be directly applicable in all Member States commencing in 2018, harmonizing the patchwork of 28 national privacy regimes.
This is seen as a major step forward in achieving a digital single market. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR, the EU
Commission announced a review of the e-Privacy Directive, which regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications
sector.

    Our European operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on
consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the EU level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their

                                                                 I-39
services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such
as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the
degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages.

     The EU Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy
consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and
studies regarding energy consumption with the EU Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we are
working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software
to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to
create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation. The EU Commission formally
recognized this voluntary agreement as a valid alternative to regulation on November 22, 2012. Nevertheless, legislation in this
area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy in customer homes.

     Pursuant to a Regulation on standby power effective January 7, 2010 (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required
to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. For this
purpose, our set-top boxes and certain other equipment are equipped with an off switch. Beginning in January 2013, the Standby
Regulation imposed further requirements on power management on certain devices we purchase and/or develop. These devices,
namely the Horizon TV set-top box and any future set-top boxes, must comply with such requirements, unless it can be argued
such requirements are inappropriate. These additional requirements have necessitated additional software developments for our
equipment and reduce the functionality of our equipment, assuming the equipment’s default setting is maintained.

    Furthermore in August 2013, the EU Commission issued an amendment to the Standby Regulation called Networked Standby
(No 801/2013), which became effective as of January 1, 2015, with the aim of regulating, among others, the maximum power
consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called Networked Standby mode. As is the case with the Standby
Regulation, these additional requirements may have an impact on our costs and the customer experience.

     As part of the EU’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television has
been approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the
700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum will become available will vary among the European countries in
which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we
may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes
to our networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy
Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful
interference. As a result, we are in on-going discussions with relevant Member States and the EU Commission to be included in
LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialogs with equipment
manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks. We have also requested Member States and the EU
Commission to prepare comprehensive national impact assessments when spectrum conditions are changed to ensure that the costs
to prevent interference between the various services are balanced.

  United Kingdom

     In the U.K., the Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms
of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006,
which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges,
license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations
2003, as amended, implemented EU Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of
privacy in the electronic communications sector.

    Telecommunications companies in the U.K., including Virgin Media , are also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting
Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise
Act 2002. The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) regulates on-demand programming, which is derived from the EU
Audiovisual Media Services Directive.

     Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates. It is responsible for
furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant
markets where appropriate by promoting competition. The Competition and Markets Authority also has jurisdiction with respect
to competition matters.

    Broadband Expansion. The U.K. government is attempting to drive the provision of super-fast broadband to 95% of the
population of the U.K. by 2017 using money from the publicly funded BBC Licence Fee, under-spend from the Analogue TV
Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment to stimulate private investment. In addition, the U.K. government has
                                                               I-40
announced that everyone will, by 2020, have a legal right to request a broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps, regardless of
where they live. The U.K. government intends to achieve this by introducing a broadband Universal Service Obligation (USO)
and it is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population. Virgin Media is currently considering the implications
of the USO and is working closely with the U.K. government to understand the plan.
    Television and VoD Services. Following a review by Ofcom, Sky’s Wholesale Must Offer (WMO) obligation, which regulates
terms of the wholesale supply of Sky Sports 1 and 2 in SD and HD, has recently been removed. This has no impact on Virgin
Media. The appeal of Ofcom’s original decision to impose the remedy in 2010 has now been withdrawn by all parties. It is possible,
however, that the new Ofcom decision removing the obligation could be appealed.

          In November 2014, Ofcom opened an investigation into the arrangements by which the FA Premier League collectively
sells the live U.K. audio-visual media rights to Premier League football (soccer) matches. Ofcom’s investigation is on the basis
that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that these arrangements appreciably restrict or distort competition in breach of the
prohibition in Chapter I of the Competition Act of 1998 and/or Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union. Ofcom is continuing its investigation, including undertaking further market research.

    Strategic Review of Digital Communications. In March 2015, Ofcom launched a strategic review of U.K. digital
communications, with the stated objective of ensuring that digital communications markets continue to work for consumers and
businesses, with wide availability of high-quality services (both fixed and mobile). A “discussion document” was published in
July 2015, inviting stakeholder comment and input. Key focus areas for Ofcom are: investment and innovation, delivering
widespread availability of services; sustainable competition; empowering consumers; and, targeted regulation where necessary,
deregulation elsewhere. Virgin Media responded to the ‘discussion document’ emphasizing the importance of investment for
competition, innovation and consumer interest.

     A key area of consideration is the future regulatory treatment of BT, in particular whether BT should be fully (structurally)
separated, with the Openreach network division becoming a separate, independent company. An “emerging thinking” document
is due to be published in late February 2016, setting out conclusions and any proposals for reform of the U.K. regime. This exercise
would establish Ofcom ’s policy positions going forward and will influence and inform the approach taken for future market
reviews.

     Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom is in the process of reviewing the U.K. Business Connectivity
Markets (leased lines and dedicated business connections, among others). BT has provisionally been found to hold Significant
Market Power in certain markets, with consequential regulatory remedies proposed by Ofcom. Among these is a proposed
obligation for BT to provide access to its dark fiber. Virgin Media, in common with a number of other investors in network
(including BT), is opposed to this proposed remedy and is in the process of lobbying against it. Ofcom is expected to publish final
conclusions in the spring of 2016.

    Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to EU regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These
regulations set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming
within the EU, provides for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information, imposes measures to guard against bill
shock with respect to data roaming and sets maximum roaming rates within the EU. A new Regulation, effective June 2017,
abolishes roaming tariffs in the EU (subject to addressing inconsistencies in underlying wholesale charges). A preceding transitional
period has been established such that roaming surcharges will reduce significantly from April 2016.

     Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power
charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to
Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2015-2018, with rates reducing to approximately half
of their starting levels by the end of this period. Virgin Media has experienced a reduction in revenue from such charges, although
with some off-setting reductions in cost.

  Germany

     Germany has incorporated the EU laws into national laws although under the German legal system competency is split between
the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German
Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by
telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The 2009 revisions to the Regulatory
Framework by the EU were implemented by Germany in May 2012. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur)
is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel Office (the FCO), the
national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure and media regulation.
The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition issues will be addressed
by the German Federal Network Agency.

                                                                I-41
     Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16
federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting
Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own
independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector.
The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation
of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of channel
carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, the bundling of programs and price regulation.

     The allocation and use of analog cable transmission capacities for both radio and television channels in Germany is governed
by the must carry rules of the respective German federal states. The allocation of digital transmission capacities for digital television
and radio channels is primarily governed by the must carry rules of the State Broadcasting Treaty. The media law in the states of
Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse require Unitymedia to carry at least 13, 23 and 24 analog channels,
respectively, and also limits Unitymedia’s ability to convert these analog cable channels into digital channels.

    The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the
German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other
content providers through conditional access systems.

   On December 15, 2011, the FCO approved our acquisition of the Unitymedia BW GmbH (formerly known as Kabel BW
GmbH) (KBW) cable network in Germany (the KBW Acquisition), subject to our agreement with the following conditions:

    •    Unitymedia committed to the distribution of basic digital television channels (as opposed to channels marketed in premium
         subscription packages) on its entire network in unencrypted form. This commitment, with which we have complied,
         generally covers free-to-air television channels in SD and HD and is consistent with the practice that had been adopted
         by KBW prior to the KBW Acquisition. If, however, FTA television broadcasters request their HD content to be distributed
         in an encrypted HD package, the encryption of FTA HD channels is still possible. In addition, we made a commitment
         that, through December 31, 2016, the annual channel carriage fees Unitymedia receives for each such FTA television
         channel distributed in digital or simulcast in digital and analog would not exceed a specified annual amount, determined
         by applying the applicable rate card systems of Unitymedia as of January 1, 2012.

    •    Effective January 1, 2012, Unitymedia waived its exclusivity rights in access agreements with housing associations with
         respect to the usage of infrastructures other than its in-building distribution networks to provide television, broadband
         internet or telephony services within the building.

    •    Effective January 1, 2012, upon expiration of the minimum term of an access agreement with a housing association,
         Unitymedia transferred the ownership rights to the in-building distribution network to the building owner or other party
         granting access. In addition, Unitymedia waived its right to remove its in-building distribution networks.

    •    A special early termination right was granted with respect to certain of Unitymedia’s existing access agreements (the
         Remedy HA Agreements) with the largest housing associations that cover more than 800 dwelling units and which had
         a remaining term of more than three years as of December 15, 2011. The total number of dwelling units covered by the
         Remedy HA Agreements was approximately 340,000 as of December 15, 2011. The special termination right may be
         exercised on or before September 30 of each calendar year up to the expiration of the current contract term, with termination
         effective as of January 1 or July 1 of the following year. If the special termination right is exercised, compensation will
         be paid to partially reimburse Unitymedia for its unamortized investments in modernizing the in-building network based
         on an agreed formula. To the extent Unitymedia is successful in obtaining renewals of the Remedy HA Agreements, we
         expect that these renewed contracts will contain pricing and other provisions that are somewhat less favorable to
         Unitymedia than those in previous agreements.

  The Netherlands

     The Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. According to this electronic
communications law, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, was required to perform a market analysis
to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed a
market assessment of the television market in the Netherlands, concluding that there were no grounds for regulation of that market.
As a result, no new regulations relating to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis. In particular, ACM
rejected previously filed requests from a number of providers to perform a new market analysis of the television market and this
decision was upheld by the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court on November 5, 2012.



                                                                  I-42
    On August 5, 2013, ACM published its latest market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed
termination market and the mobile termination market. The new tariffs became effective September 1, 2013, and apply for a three
year period. The decision was appealed by various operators, including us, and on August 27, 2013, the Dutch Supreme
Administrative Court decided in a preliminary decision that the decrease of cap charges should be less steep than ACM had initially
determined. These revised tariffs apply until the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court arrives at a final decision in the appeal
proceedings on the merits. This final decision is not expected before the end of 2016 because the Dutch Supreme Administrative
Court ruled on October 15, 2014, that it wishes to pose prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice.

     On January 1, 2014, the revised must carry obligations became effective. The revised must carry obligations do not only apply
to cable operators, as was previously the case, but also apply to all providers of analog and digital program packages based on the
principle of technology neutrality. Providers of digital program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers are subject to the
obligation to provide at least 30 television channels, including six public television broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation,
a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and a number of digital radio broadcasting channels. In
addition, all providers of analog program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers must include at least 15 television channels,
including five public broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting
channels and some analog radio broadcasting channels. The Dutch Media Authority can grant a (conditional) exemption from the
obligation if the must carry obligations listed above give rise to disproportionate costs for the network operator, an impediment
to innovation or other unreasonable outcomes.

    There is no regulated financing mechanism in place between network operators and broadcasters. Commercial and public
program providers must negotiate with network operators regarding transmission fees.

     In connection with the acquisition of the outstanding shares of Ziggo (the Ziggo Acquisition), we obtained regulatory clearance
from the EU Commission on October 10, 2014. The clearance was conditioned upon our commitment to divest our Film1 channels
to a third-party and to carry Film1 on our network in the Netherlands for a period of three years. On July 21, 2015, we sold our
Film1 channels to Sony Pictures Television Networks. Under the terms of the agreement, all five Film1 channels will continue to
be carried on certain of our networks for a period of at least three years.

    In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator filed an appeal against the EU Commission regarding its
decision to approve the Ziggo Acquisition. We are not a party to the appeal and we do not expect that the filing of this appeal will
have any impact on the ongoing integration and development of our operations in the Netherlands.

     Following the EU Commission’s clearance of the Ziggo Acquisition, on October 31, 2014, ACM published as part of the
fourth round of market analysis a draft of market analysis decision on LLU. In this draft decision, ACM found that there is a risk
of joint dominance of KPN and Ziggo in the related retail broadband market, which would be remedied on the wholesale market
for LLU where ACM found a risk of single dominance of KPN. This draft decision was subject to national consultation followed
by notification to the EU Commission. The EU Commission issued serious doubts regarding the draft LLU decision, causing
ACM to redraft their initial decision. After another national consultation in July 2015 and European notification in November
2015, ACM published the final decision on December 17, 2015. In the final decision, ACM no longer finds a risk of joint dominance
for KPN and Ziggo at the retail level but still concludes that there is a risk of consumer harm due to prices being set above the
competitive equilibrium. At the wholesale level, ACM concluded that Ziggo is not part of the relevant LLU market and that KPN
is dominant on that market, and ACM imposed obligations on KPN only.

  Belgium

    Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of
June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform the market
analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament
prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012.

     Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed
public telephone network. Since April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging
the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. On July 14, 2015, the BIPT published a draft
decision regarding the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the public telephone network provided at a fixed location. The
BIPT has organized a public consultation on this draft decision, which was open for reactions until September 15, 2015. This draft
decision has not yet been submitted to the EU Commission for notification. A final decision is expected in 2016.

     Although no determination has been made on whether Telenet has Significant Market Power on the market for call termination
on individual mobile networks, its rates will be affected by rate limitations implemented by BIPT. In June 2010, BIPT imposed

                                                                 I-43
a steep rate reduction that resulted in (1) an initial 45% decline effective August 1, 2010, over the then average rate and (2) a
further decline in January 2013 that was approximately 79% less than the average rate implemented on August 1, 2010. As of
January 1, 2013, mobile termination rates have been set by BIPT at €1.08 cents per minute, and to date, 2015 rates have not been
set. On September 14, 2015, the BIPT published its draft decision on the relevant market for “call termination on individual mobile
networks”. Telenet, as an MVNO, has been designated in the draft decision as having Significant Market Power. In the draft
decision, the BIPT adopts a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on individual mobile
networks, resulting in a nominal value of €0.81 per minute in 2015 and a declining glide path up and until 2020. The BIPT organized
public consultation on this draft decision, which was open until November 14, 2015. This draft decision has not yet been submitted
to the EU Commission for notification. A final decision is expected in 2016.

     In December 2010, the BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities)
published their respective draft decisions reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium. The
Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the July 2011 Decision) with some minor revisions.
The regulatory obligations imposed by the July 2011 Decision include (1) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’
of the cable analog package available to third-party operators (including Proximus), (2) an obligation to grant third-party operators
(except Proximus) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at “retail minus”, and (3) an
obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital television
access obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except Proximus).

    In February 2012, Telenet submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above, and the Belgium
Regulatory Authorities published the final decision on September 9, 2013. Telenet has implemented the access obligations as
described in its reference offers and, as of June 23, 2014, access to the Telenet network had become operational and can be applied
by wireless operator Mobistar SA (Mobistar). In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of
Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014, Proximus submitted a request to Telenet to commence access negotiations.
Telenet contests this request and has asked the Belgium Regulatory Authorities to assess the reasonableness of the Proximus
request. The timing for a decision regarding this assessment by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities is not known.

       On December 14, 2015, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft decision, which amended previously-issued
decisions, that sets forth the “retail-minus” tariffs of minus 26% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and
minus 18% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services during an initial two-year period. Following this
two-year period, the tariffs would change to minus 15% and 7%, respectively. The draft decision was notified to the European
Commission and a final decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016. A “retail-minus” method of pricing involves a wholesale
tariff calculated as the retail price for the offered service by Telenet, excluding VAT and copyrights, and further deducting the retail
costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing and sales).

     Telenet filed an appeal against the July 2011 Decision with the Brussels Court of Appeal. On November 12, 2014, the Brussels
Court of Appeal rejected Telenet’s appeal and accepted Proximus’s claim that Proximus should be allowed access to Telenet ’s,
among other operators, digital television platform and the resale of bundles of digital video and broadband internet services. On
November 30, 2015, Telenet filed an appeal of this decision with the Supreme Court. Telenet and wireless operator Mobistar each
filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the decision regarding the quantitative aspects of the reference offers.
A decision with respect to these appeals is expected in 2016. There can be no certainty that Telenet’s appeals will be successful.

     The July 2011 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access
to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in
developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to
Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s
ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent
on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to Telenet’s network and other competitive
factors or market developments.

  Switzerland

     Switzerland has a regulatory system which partially reflects the principles of the EU, but otherwise is distinct from the European
regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen) regulates, in
general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution
of radio and television, however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Radio und Fernsehgesetz). In addition, the
Competition Act and the Act on Price Surveillance are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption
of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the revised Energy Ordinance have been applicable since January 2010 to television
set-top boxes as described below.

                                                                 I-44
     Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunications services needs to register with the Federal Office
of Communications. Dominant providers have to grant access to their infrastructure to third parties, including LLU access. This
access regulation, however, is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling
obligations do not apply to UPC CHAT in Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access
to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined
to be dominant in this regard. Dominant operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming
part of the universal service in Switzerland have to ensure interoperability of services.

     The Federal Council has suggested that the current Telecommunications Act be revised in two steps. First, the Federal Council
plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better consumer protection (decreasing roaming
fees, unbundling of products, measures to prevent spoofing) and a slight change to the regulatory regime (introducing partial ex-
officio rights for the Federal Communications Commission). Second, the Federal Council plans to introduce technology neutrality
into the Telecommunications Act, as well as to further implement consumer and youth protection measures. Possibly, the topic of
regulated net neutrality may be introduced in a second part of the revision. This second step is not expected to start before 2018.
In addition, it is expected that the conditions for a national broadband rollout will be improved by introducing access obligations
to the ducts of local utilities.

     Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain
programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of
Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation.
In the past, these programs needed to be distributed in analog. A new Radio and Television ordinance became effective August 1,
2012, which allowed cable operators to decrease the number of obligatory channels to be broadcasted in analog. A departmental
ordinance was published which eliminates this regime for all foreign broadcasters as of June 1, 2013, and all other such regulation
as of January 1, 2015. Additionally, there is no legal obligation to broadcast digital and analog in parallel as long as the digital
offer is comparable to analog and does not force customers to incur additional costs.

      Up until the end of 2015, UPC CHAT’s retail customer prices were subject to review by the Swiss Price Regulator. In October
2012, UPC CHAT announced an agreement with the Swiss Price Regulator pursuant to which UPC CHAT will make certain
changes to its service offerings in Switzerland in exchange for progressive increases in the price of its basic cable connection. In
this regard, (1) effective November 1, 2012, UPC CHAT began offering a basic tier of digital television channels on an unencrypted
basis in its Switzerland footprint and (2) effective January 3, 2013, for video subscribers who pay the required upfront activation
fee, UPC CHAT has made available, at no additional monthly charge, a 2 Mbps internet connection, which was an increase from
the previously-offered 300 Kbps internet connection. In addition, the monthly price for a cable connection increased by CHF 0.90
($0.90) effective January 1, 2013 and a further increase of CHF 0.60 ($0.60) took effect on January 1, 2014. During the course
of 2015, negotiations with the price regulator led to a verdict to stop monitoring the prices of UPC CHAT in Switzerland. This
decision was justified by the fact that by competition from Swisscom and Sunrise, there is competition for the TV end user.

     Effective October 1, 2014, the Federal Council proposed a new regulation imposing power thresholds for set-top boxes. There
are some exemptions and transition periods that apply in the short term to the set-top boxes we import into Switzerland. The Swiss
regulation may not be in line with EU regulation, and it may be reconsidered as Switzerland tries to align itself with EU norms.
If, however, such regulation remains in force, it may have an adverse effect on the business of UPC Cablecom as UPC Cablecom
may face restrictions regarding the import of set-top boxes.

  LiLAC Group

  Chile

    VTR is subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental entities in Chile including the Chilean Antitrust
Authority, the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (the Ministry) through the Chilean Undersecretary of
Telecommunications (SubTel), the National Television Council (CNTV) and Chile’s National Consumer Service (Sernac).

     In addition to the specific regulations described below, VTR is subject to certain regulatory conditions which were imposed
by the Chilean Antitrust Authority in connection with VTR’s combination with Metrópolis Intercom SA in April 2005. These
conditions are indefinite and include, among others, (1) prohibiting VTR and its control group from participating, directly or
indirectly through a related person, in Chilean satellite or microwave television businesses, (2) prohibiting VTR from obtaining
exclusive broadcast rights, except for specific events, and (3) requiring VTR to offer its broadband capacity for resale of internet
services on a wholesale basis.

                                                               I-45
     The provision of pay television services requires a permit issued by the Ministry. Cable pay television permits are granted for
an indefinite term and are non-exclusive. As such permits do not involve radioelectric spectrum, they are granted without ongoing
duties or royalties. VTR has permits to provide cable pay television services in the major cities, including Santiago, and in most
of the medium-sized markets in Chile.

     Cable television service providers in Chile are free to define the channels and content included in their services and are not
required to carry any specific programming, except as described below. However, CNTV may impose sanctions on providers who
are found to have run programming containing excessive violence, pornography or other objectionable content. Pay television
operators are directly responsible for violation of such prohibitions. Additionally, the Television Act requires pay television
operators to offer a certain quota of cultural content and to distribute public interest campaigns.

     The Television Act has been recently amended to establish a retransmission consent regime between broadcast television
concessionaires and pay television operators. This regime provides that once a broadcast operator achieves digital coverage of
85% of the population within its concession areas, the broadcast operator may require that pay television operators enter into an
agreement for the retransmission of its digital signal. In addition, the Television Act requires that the technical or commercial
conditions imposed by broadcast operators not discriminate among pay television operators. Also, the Television Act establishes
a must carry regime requiring pay television operators to distribute up to four local broadcast television channels in each operating
area. The channels that must be carried by any particular pay television operator are to be selected by CNTV.

     The Chilean Consumer’s Rights Protection Law contains provisions that have been interpreted by Sernac to require that any
increase in rates exceeding inflation must be previously accepted and agreed to by subscribers. Although VTR disagrees with this
interpretation, in July 2012, VTR reached an agreement with Sernac that permits VTR to make adjustments to its published rates
twice per year to adjust for inflation. In addition, VTR may once a year propose to its existing subscribers additional changes to
their rates. If a subscriber does not accept these proposed rate changes, the subscriber is permitted to terminate its subscription
contract. In addition, the agreement with Sernac establishes the criteria upon which VTR may modify its channel line-up without
the consent of subscribers.

  Internet

     In August 2010, a law on internet neutrality was passed, which prohibits “arbitrary blockings” of legal content, applications
or services and the provision of differentiated service conditions according to the origin or ownership of the content or service
provided through the internet. Additionally, the law authorizes ISPs to take measures to ensure the privacy of their users and
provide virus protection and safety processes over their network, as long as these measures do not infringe antitrust laws. Additional
measures were subsequently implemented, including obligations related to consumer information, traffic management policies
applied by each ISP and internet quality of service requirements and notices required by law concerning the effective maximum
and minimum traffic speeds offered under internet access plans.

     In order to protect the constitutional rights of privacy and safety of communications, ISPs are prohibited from undertaking
surveillance measures over data content on their networks. Also, special summary proceedings have been created in order to
safeguard intellectual property rights against violations committed through networks or digital systems. These proceedings include
measures designed to withdraw, disqualify or block infringing content in the ISP’s network or systems. The law also provides for
the right of intellectual property owners to judicially request from ISPs the delivery of necessary information to identify the provider
of infringing content.

  Fixed-Line and Mobile Telephony Services

     The provision of fixed-line and mobile telephony services requires a public telecommunications service concession. With
respect to mobile services, in 2009, SubTel awarded VTR a license for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1700/2100 MHz frequency
band for the provision of wireless telephony services. The license has a 30-year renewable term. In 2012, VTR transferred this
license to its affiliate VTR Wireless SpA (VTR Wireless) which is now a subsidiary of VTR known as VTR Comunicaciones
SpA. On January 15, 2014, VTR Wireless received a letter from SubTel in which SubTel asserted that VTR Wireless is not in
compliance with the terms of such wireless license. SubTel alleged that the terms of the wireless license require VTR Wireless to
comply with certain minimum network coverage and traffic levels. VTR disagrees with SubTel’s assertions regarding the terms
of the wireless license and has contested such assertions vigorously.

     VTR has concessions to provide fixed-line telephony in most major and medium-sized markets in Chile. Telephony concessions
are non-exclusive and have renewable 30-year terms. The original term of VTR’s fixed-line telephony concessions expires in
November 2025. Long distance telephony services are considered intermediate telecommunications services and, as such, are
also regulated by the Ministry. VTR has concessions to provide this service, which is non-exclusive, for a 30-year renewable term
expiring in September 2025. In Chile, fixed-line telephony communications between primary zones within the country were, until

                                                                 I-46
recently, domestic long distance calls. Then, on November 6, 2013, SubTel eliminated domestic long distance calls and in August
2014, it completed the process of unifying Chile into a single telephone service primary zone. We believe this new system may
benefit VTR along with the Chilean fixed-line market as a whole in relation to VTR’s mobile telephony competition. Fixed-line
subscribers now have the ability to make phone calls throughout Chile without incurring long-distance charges, thereby making
VTR’s fixed-line telephony services more attractive.

     There are no universal service obligations in Chile. However, local service concessionaires are obligated to provide telephony
service to all customers that are within their service area or are willing to pay for an extension to receive service. All local service
providers, including VTR, must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network connections at
regulated prices and must interconnect with all other public services concessionaires whose systems are technically compatible.

     As a general rule, fixed-line telephony service providers are free to establish the rates directly charged to their customers,
unless the Chilean Antitrust Authority concludes that due to a lack of sufficient competition in the market, rates should be fixed
by SubTel. However, SubTel sets the maximum rates that may be charged by each operator for interconnect charges, access charges
between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other
providers, and charges for network unbundling services. Rate regulation on interconnection charges is applicable to all fixed-line
and mobile telephony companies, including VTR. The determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by operators for
their fixed-line or mobile services are made on a case-by-case basis by SubTel and are effective for five years. In September 2014,
VTR received a tariff proposal from SubTel that would have retroactive effect to June 2012. In this regard, beginning in September
2014, various decreases to tariff rates have been proposed and implemented by Chilean regulatory authorities, and a further decrease
to one tariff rate is pending. None of these decreases had, or are expected to have, a material impact on VTR’s revenue or expenses.

  Other Chilean Regulation

    •    Bundling. On December 18, 2012, the Chilean Antitrust Authority issued its regulation governing the on-net/off-net
         pricing practice in the mobile telephone industry and the offering of bundled telecommunication services. Pursuant to
         the terms of this regulation, as revised by the Chilean Supreme Court, mobile services may be sold jointly with fixed-
         line services. However, promotional discounts were not permitted for these double-play offers. As for traditional bundling
         over the same platform (e.g., bundled fixed-line services such as our double- and triple-play packages, or bundled mobile
         services), this regulation provides that such services may be bundled, subject to certain price limitations. These limitations
         require that the total price for a bundle must be greater than the standalone price for the most expensive service included
         in the bundle. Also, when three or more services are bundled, the price for the bundle must be greater than the sum of
         the standalone prices for each service in the bundle, excluding the lowest priced service.

    •    Telecommunication Services Proposal. In February 2014, SubTel published a General Telecommunication Services
         Ruling that regulates the offer of telecommunication services, including voice, internet access, and pay television, either
         alone or in bundles, from a consumer protection point of view. The new regulation introduced service billing, significant
         changes in contracts with customers, new requirements regarding compensation in case of service failure, and new rules
         regarding treatment of customers’ personal information.

    •    Minimum Standards on Quality of Service and Operation. From August 5 to September 4, 2013, SubTel submitted for
         public comment a draft of the Technical Fundamental Plan on Maintenance and Public Service Telecommunications
         Network Managing. This draft seeks to impose minimum standards on quality of service and operation of
         telecommunications networks, in general, and in some particular services: voice services; text and multimedia messages
         services; data transmission services; minimum coverage for mobile services; and digital terrestrial television minimum
         coverage. We are uncertain when SubTel will publish the final version of the plan.

  Puerto Rico

     We are subject to regulation in Puerto Rico by various governmental entities at the Puerto Rico and the United States federal
level, including the FCC. The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board (TRB), which was established in 1996, has
primary regulatory jurisdiction in Puerto Rico at the local level and is responsible for awarding franchises to cable operators for
the provision of cable service in Puerto Rico and regulating cable television and telecommunications services.

     Our business in Puerto Rico is subject to comprehensive regulation under the United States Communications Act of 1934, as
amended (the Communications Act), which regulates communication, telecommunication and cable television services. The
Communications Act also provides the general legal framework for, among other things, the installation, operation and provision
of telephone services, services related to interconnection between telephone carriers, and television, radio, cable television and
direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, services.


                                                                 I-47
    The FCC and/or the TRB have the authority to impose sanctions, including warnings, fines, license revocations and, in certain
specific cases, termination of the franchise, although license revocation and franchise termination are rare. The Communications
Act specifies causes for the termination of an operator’s FCC license, including, for example, the failure to comply with license
requirements and conditions or to pay fines or fees in a timely manner. Such sanctions can be appealed to, and reviewed by, the
Puerto Rican courts and the United States federal courts.

     In Puerto Rico, antitrust regulation is governed by the U.S. Sherman Act, other federal antitrust legislation, and the Puerto
Rico Anti-Monopoly Law. In particular, the Sherman Act sets conditions to and approves certain business combinations and seeks
to prevent anti-competitive practices, among other things. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. The Puerto Rico
Anti-Monopoly Law substantially parallels the Sherman Act and authorizes the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to investigate
and impose competition-related conditions on transactions.

     Puerto Rico Law 5 of 1973, as amended, created the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs (DACO), which regulates
marketing campaigns, publicity, and breach of service contracts, and prohibits false advertising. The Puerto Rico
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Law 213), which created the TRB, requires that rates for telecommunication services be cost-
based, forbids cross-subsidies and focuses on encouraging, preserving and enforcing competition in the cable and
telecommunications markets. Although Law 213 does not require us to obtain any approval of rate increases for cable television
or telecommunication services, any such increases must be in compliance with Law 213’s requirements, including prior pro forma
notification to the TRB before such increases take effect.

    The video, Internet and voice services that we provide are all subject to regulation:

    •    Video. The provision of cable television services requires a franchise issued by the TRB. Franchises are subject to
         termination proceedings in the event of a material breach or failure to comply with certain provisions set forth in the
         franchise agreement governing a franchisee’s system operations, although such terminations are rare. In addition,
         franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the grant of authority. Franchises establish comprehensive
         facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-
         compliance. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of up to ten years and must be periodically renewed.

         Our pay television service is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations and must-carry and
         retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations. The Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the carriage
         relationship between broadcast television stations and cable companies. To ensure that every qualifying local television
         station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals,
         the FCC allows every qualifying full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems transmit
         that station’s primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station’s market (the “must carry” rule) pursuant to
         the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Alternatively, a station may elect every three years
         to forego its must carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local cable
         system, referred to as retransmission consent.

    •    Internet. We offer high-speed internet access throughout our entire footprint. In March 2015, the FCC issued an order
         classifying mass-market broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service,” changing its long-standing
         treatment of this offering as an “information service”, which the FCC traditionally has subjected to limited regulation.
         The FCC adopted rules that prohibit, among other things, broadband providers from: (1) blocking access to lawful content,
         applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content,
         applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (3) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful Internet
         traffic in exchange for consideration. In addition, the FCC adopted a rule prohibiting broadband providers from
         unreasonably interfering with users’ ability to access lawful content or use devices that do not harm the network, or with
         edge providers’ ability to disseminate their content. The FCC also imposed more detailed disclosure obligations on
         broadband providers than were previously in place, which were approved by the Office of Management and Budget in
         late 2015. The FCC’s new rules are in effect, but have been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the
         District of Columbia Circuit. Oral argument has been heard and the court may rule at any time. We cannot predict how
         the court will rule or whether any further court proceedings will take place. The impact of these revised rules on our
         business, if they are ultimately sustained by the courts in whole or in part, is unclear.

    •    Voice Services. We offer voice services, including both circuit-switched telephony and VoIP. Our circuit-switched
         telephony services are subject to FCC and local regulations regarding the quality and technical aspects of service. All
         local telecommunications providers, including us, are obligated to provide telephony service to all customers within the
         service area, subject to certain exceptions under FCC rules and regulations, and must give long distance telephony service
         providers equal access to their network. Under the Communications Act, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs),
         like us, may require interconnection with the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), and the ILEC must negotiate a
                                                                I-48
         reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection agreement with the CLEC. Such arrangement requires the ILEC to
         interconnect with the CLEC at any technically feasible point within the ILEC’s network, provide access to unbundled
         network elements (UNE) of the ILEC’s network, offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunication services the
         ILEC provides to its own retail clients, and allow physical collocation of the CLEC’s equipment in the ILEC’s facilities
         to permit interconnection or access to UNE services. Therefore, we have the right to interconnect with the incumbent
         local exchange carrier, PRT. We have negotiated an interconnection agreement with PRT, and the technical process leading
         to physical interconnection is underway between personnel of both companies.

         All of our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for the Federal Universal Service Fund
         (USF), which is a fund created under the Communications Act to subsidize telecommunications services in high-cost
         areas, to provide telecommunications services for low-income consumers, and to provide certain subsidies for schools,
         libraries and rural healthcare facilities. The FCC has redirected the USF to support broadband deployment in high-cost
         areas. In addition, our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for a local Puerto Rico Universal
         Service Fund, which was created by law to subsidize telecommunications services for low-income families under the
         Federal USF Lifeline and Link-Up programs.

         The FCC has adopted other regulations for VoIP services, including the requirement that interconnected VoIP providers
         and facilities-based broadband internet access providers must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law
         Enforcement Act, which requires carriers to provide certain assistance to federal law enforcement authorities. VoIP
         providers are also required to offer basic and enhanced 911 emergency calling services, which requires disclosure to all
         VoIP customers. VoIP providers are also subject to federal customer proprietary network information rules related to
         customer privacy.

Employees

     As of December 31, 2015, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 37,000 full-time
equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works councils. Certain of our subsidiaries also use
contract and temporary employees, which are not included in this number, for various projects. We believe that our employee
relations are good.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

     Financial information related to the geographic areas in which we do business appears in note 18 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Available Information

    All our filings with the SEC as well as amendments to such filings are available on our internet website free of charge generally
within 24 hours after we file such material with the SEC. Our website address is www.libertyglobal.com. The information on our
website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the following risk
factors in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our
company.

    The risk factors described in this section have been separated into five groups:

    •    risks that relate to the competition we face and the technology used in our businesses;

    •    risks that relate to our operating in overseas markets and being subject to foreign regulation;

    •    risks that relate to certain financial matters;

    •    risks relating to our equity capital structure; and

    •    other risks, including risks that, among other things, relate to the obstacles that may be faced by anyone who may seek
         to acquire us.



                                                                 I-49
     Although we describe below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the risks we consider to be the most material,
there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have
material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, past
financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate
results or trends in future periods.

    If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Factors Relating to Competition and Technology

     We operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively compete with other
service providers. The markets for cable television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in many of the
regions in which we operate are highly competitive. In the provision of video services, we face competition from FTA and DTT
broadcasters, video provided via satellite platforms, networks using DSL, VDSL or vectoring technology, MMDS operators, FTTx
networks, over-the-top video content aggregators, and, in some countries where parts of our systems are overbuilt, cable networks,
among others. Our operating businesses are facing increasing competition from video services provided by, or over the networks
of, incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet
increases, we also face competition from over-the-top video content providers utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet
connections. In the provision of telephony and broadband internet services, we are experiencing increasing competition from the
incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers in each country in which we operate, as well as mobile
providers of voice and data. The incumbent telecommunications operators typically dominate the market for these services and
have the advantage of nationwide networks and greater resources than we have to devote to the provision of these services. Many
of the incumbent operators are now offering double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries,
we also compete with other operators using LLU to provide these services, other facilities-based operators and wireless providers.
Developments in the DSL and other technology used by the incumbent telecommunications operators and alternative providers
have improved the attractiveness of our competitors’ products and services and strengthened their competitive position.
Developments in wireless technologies, such as LTE (the next generation of ultra high-speed mobile data) and WiFi, are creating
additional competitive challenges.

     In some of our markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved, either directly or indirectly,
in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications systems. We intend to pursue available options
to restrict such involvement or to ensure that such involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in these pursuits. As a result, we may face competition from entities not requiring a normal
commercial return on their investments. In addition, we may face more vigorous competition than would have been the case if
there were no government involvement.

     We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and new market
entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, advances in technology, the
influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased
competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and
significant price competition in most of our markets. In combination with difficult economic environments, these competitive
pressures could adversely impact our ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, average monthly subscription
revenue per average RGU (ARPU), RGUs, adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA),
Adjusted OIBDA margins and liquidity of our operating segments.

     Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Technology in the video,
telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including advances in current technologies and the emergence
of new technologies. New technologies, products and services may impact consumer behavior and therefore demand for our
products and services. The ability to anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and
enhanced products and services on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our revenue and number of
subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations or demand,
can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance of new products and
services that we may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or services by others, could have a material
adverse impact on our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA.

    Our property and equipment additions may not generate a positive return. The video, broadband internet and telephony
businesses in which we operate are capital intensive. Significant additions to our property and equipment are required to add
customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and upgrade customer premises
equipment to enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience. These additions require significant capital
                                                               I-50
expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs. Significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion
of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to
decide to undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and customer premises equipment in the impacted markets.
In addition, no assurance can be given that any future upgrades or extensions of our network (including the Network Extensions )
will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades or extensions. If we
are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding, extending or upgrading our networks
or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our property and equipment, our growth could be limited and our competitive
position could be harmed.

      We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters for
programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable terms could adversely
affect our business. The success of our video subscription business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a wide selection
of popular programming to our subscribers. We generally do not produce our own content and we depend on our agreements,
relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If we
fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay television services, including a sufficient selection of HD channels
as well as non-linear content (such as VoD and DVR capability), on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling
video product to our customers at a price they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating
programming agreements and our annual costs for programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming and
copyright costs will continue to rise in future periods as a result of, among other factors, higher costs associated with the expansion
of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast
of live sporting events, and retransmission or copyright fees payable to public broadcasters.

    If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and future television
services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers
from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore,
we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain of our competitors, for example BT and Sky in the U.K., obtain exclusive
programming rights, particularly with respect to popular sports and movie programming. In addition, must carry requirements
may consume channel capacity otherwise available for more attractive programming.

     We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services required
for our businesses. We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide
services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various
risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor
issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely
basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in connecting customers to our
services and, accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if
demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to
provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses’ ability to attract and retain
customers. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure
of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows.
We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our
products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as
trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur
monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question.

     Our businesses that offer mobile telephony and data services rely on the radio access networks of third-party wireless
network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. Our services to mobile customers rely on the use of MVNO
arrangements in which we utilize the radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry our mobile
communications traffic. If any of our MVNO arrangements are terminated, or if the respective third-party wireless network
provider fails to provide the services required under an MVNO arrangement, or if a third-party wireless network provider fails to
deploy and maintain its network, and we are unable to find a replacement network operator on a timely and commercial basis or
at all, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services relying on such MVNO arrangement. Additionally, as our
MVNO arrangements come to term, we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement MVNO arrangements on the same
or more favorable terms.

    Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data could significantly disrupt
our operations, which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue. Our success depends, in part, on the continued
and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and network systems as well as our customer service centers. The

                                                                 I-51
hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed
in a relatively small number of locations. Our systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable to
damage or security breach from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts,
security flaws, and natural disasters. Moreover, despite security measures, our servers, systems and equipment are potentially
vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions.
Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or
accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-
party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance
of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being
considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related
risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply
with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines.

     Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause failures in our information
technology systems or disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks or similar problems. Any disruptive situation
that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our reputation and the credibility of our operations.
Further, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to our customers or otherwise meet our
business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenue.

     The “Virgin” brand is used by our subsidiary Virgin Media under licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited and is not
under the control of Virgin Media. The activities of the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand and other licensees
could have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of customers towards Virgin Media as a licensee and the licenses from
Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. The “Virgin” brand is integral to Virgin Media’s corporate
identity. Virgin Media is reliant on the general goodwill of consumers towards the Virgin brand. Consequently, adverse publicity
in relation to the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson, who is closely
associated with the brand, or in relation to another licensee of the “Virgin” name and logo (particularly in the U.K., where Virgin
Media does business) could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s reputation and on Virgin Media’s and our business
and results of operations. In addition, the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances.
For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the licenses, after providing Virgin Media with an opportunity to cure, (1)
if Virgin Media or any of its affiliates commits persistent and material breaches or a flagrant and material breach of the licenses,
(2) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the licensed trademarks by
Virgin Media has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the “Virgin” brand, or (3) if a
third party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a “fit and proper person”, such as a legally disqualified director or a
bankrupt entity, acquires “control” of Liberty Global. Such a termination could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s
and our business and results of operations.

Factors Relating to Overseas Operations and Foreign Regulation

     Our businesses are conducted almost exclusively outside of the United States, which gives rise to numerous operational
risks. Our businesses operate almost exclusively in countries outside the United States and are thereby subject to the following
inherent risks:

    •    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

    •    difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    •    potentially adverse tax consequences;

    •    export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers;

    •    increases in taxes and governmental fees;

    •    economic and political instability; and

    •    changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies.

     Operational risks that we may experience in certain countries include disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment
that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political
unrest.


                                                                   I-52
     We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect
to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the
operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although we generally seek to match the
denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the
respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not
denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide
for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert
unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2015, substantially all of our debt was either directly
or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations.

     In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are
exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts,
notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in
our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In this regard, we currently
expect that during 2016, (1) less than 1% of our revenue, (2) approximately 3% to 5% of our aggregate operating and SG&A
expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) and (3) approximately 7% to 9% of our property and equipment
additions will be denominated in non-functional currencies, including amounts denominated in (a) U.S. dollars in Chile and Europe
and (b) euros in the U.K., Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland and Hungary. Our expectations with respect to our
non-functional currency transactions in 2016 may differ from actual results. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional
currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other
monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments
or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of
these risks. Certain non-functional currency risks related to our revenue, operating and selling, general and administrative expenses
and property and equipment additions were not hedged as of December 31, 2015. For additional information concerning our
foreign currency forward contracts, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

     We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against
the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings (loss) as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign
currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency
translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience
a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency
translation. Our primary exposure to foreign currency translation risk during the three months ended December 31, 2015, was to
the euro and British pound sterling as 43.8% and 37.0% of our U.S. dollar revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries
whose functional currencies are the euro and British pound sterling, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are
impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Swiss franc, the Chilean peso and other local currencies in Europe. We generally
do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries
and affiliates into U.S. dollars.

     Our businesses are subject to risks of adverse regulation. Our businesses are subject to the unique regulatory regimes of
the countries in which they operate. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are subject
to licensing or registration eligibility rules and regulations, which vary by country. The provision of electronic communications
networks and services requires our licensing from, or registration with, the appropriate regulatory authorities and, for telephony
services, entrance into interconnection arrangements with other phone companies, including the incumbent phone company. It is
possible that countries in which we operate may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic commerce, which could dampen
the growth of the internet services being offered and developed by these businesses. In a number of countries, our ability to
increase the prices we charge for our cable television service or make changes to the programming packages we offer is limited
by regulation or conditions imposed by competition authorities or is subject to review by regulatory authorities or is subject to
termination rights of customers. In addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third parties and, in any event, in
most of our markets new entry is possible without a license, although there may be registration eligibility rules and regulations,
resulting in greater competition in territories where our businesses may already be active. More significantly, regulatory authorities
may require us to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own
services or resell our services to end customers. Consequently, our businesses must adapt their ownership and organizational

                                                                I-53
structure as well as their pricing and service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which they are subject. A failure to
comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or
other adverse conditions.

    Adverse changes in rules and regulations could:

    •    impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue and Adjusted OIBDA;

    •    create a shortage of capacity on our networks, which could limit the types and variety of services we seek to provide our
         customers;

    •    strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets; and

    •    have a significant adverse impact on our profitability.

     Businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, such as video distribution as well as internet and telephony, or that
are vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, often face close regulatory scrutiny from
competition authorities in several countries in which we operate. This is particularly the case with respect to any proposed business
combinations, which will often require clearance from national competition authorities. The regulatory authorities in several
countries in which we do business have considered from time to time what access rights, if any, should be afforded to third parties
for use of existing cable television networks and have imposed access obligations in certain countries. This has resulted, for
example, in obligations with respect to call termination for our telephony business in Europe, video must carry obligations in many
markets in which we operate and video and broadband internet access obligations in Belgium.

    When we acquire additional communications companies, these acquisitions may require the approval of governmental
authorities (either at country or, in the case of the EU, European level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an
acquisition, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely
manner, the governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative
measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations.

     New legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regime applicable to us, which could adversely affect our competitive
position and profitability, and we may become subject to more extensive regulation if we are deemed to possess significant
market power in any of the markets in which we operate. Significant changes to the existing regulatory regime applicable to the
provision of cable television, telephony and internet services have been and are still being introduced. For example, in the EU a
large element of regulation affecting our business derives from a number of Directives that are the basis of the regulatory regime
concerning many of the services we offer across the EU. The various Directives require Member States to harmonize their laws
on communications and cover issues such as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the
EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our businesses are regulated
and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, we are subject to review by competition or national regulatory authorities in
certain countries concerning whether we exhibit Significant Market Power. A finding of Significant Market Power can result in
our company becoming subject to pricing, open access, unbundling and other requirements that could provide a more favorable
operating environment for existing and potential competitors.

     We cannot be certain that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or integrating acquired businesses with our
existing operations, or that we will achieve the expected returns on our acquisitions. Historically, our businesses have grown,
in part, through selective acquisitions that enabled them to take advantage of existing networks, local service offerings and region-
specific management expertise. We expect to seek to continue growing our businesses through acquisitions in selected markets,
such as the acquisition of Virgin Media completed in June 2013 (the Virgin Media Acquisition), the Ziggo Acquisition completed
in November 2014, the Choice Acquisition in June 2015, the BASE acquisition in 2016 and the pending acquisition of CWC. Our
ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing, debt covenants, the prevalence
of complex ownership structures among potential targets, government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers,
including private equity funds. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of these businesses, such
as Virgin Media, Ziggo, Choice, BASE and CWC, may present significant costs and challenges associated with: realizing economies
of scale in interconnection, programming and network operations; eliminating duplicative overheads; integrating personnel,
networks, financial systems and operational systems; greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with regulatory
standards or for investments to improve operating results, and failure to achieve the business plan with respect to any such
acquisition. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or realizing the anticipated benefits of
any completed acquisition, including, for example, the Virgin Media Acquisition, the Ziggo Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition,
the BASE acquisition and the pending acquisition of CWC.


                                                                I-54
     In addition, we anticipate that most, if not all, companies acquired by us will be located outside the United States. Foreign
companies may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that are as thorough or
effective as those required by U.S. securities laws. While we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence and to implement
appropriate controls and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of
these companies’ disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting until we have fully integrated
them.

     The expected benefits of the Virgin Media Acquisition may not be realized. There can be no assurance that the business
objectives of our redomestication in the U.K. as a result of the Virgin Media Acquisition will be achieved, particularly as the
achievement of the benefits are, in many important respects, subject to factors that we do not control. These factors include such
things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors, analysts
and U.K. and U.S. taxing authorities. Our ongoing expenses have increased as a result of the redomestication to the U.K., including
those expenses related to complying with U.K. corporate and tax laws. These additional expenses could serve to reduce or offset
the benefits realized from the redomestication.

     In addition, while we believe that, under the current U.S. tax statute and regulations, the Virgin Media Acquisition would not
cause Liberty Global to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal tax purposes, the IRS may interpret the current statute
and regulations differently, or the U.S. Congress, the IRS, the U.K. Parliament or U.K. tax authorities may enact new statutory or
regulatory provisions, which, in each case, could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation, or otherwise adversely
affect our anticipated global tax position. Retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past, and there can be
no assurance that any such provisions, if enacted or promulgated, would not have retroactive application to us, the Virgin Media
Acquisition or any of our subsequent actions. Our results of operations and cash flow would be adversely impacted if we were to
be subject to U.S. corporate income tax as a domestic corporation.

     We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such
as value added tax, or VAT, in the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. Significant judgment is required
in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there
are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax
authorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any
material differences as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial
position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made. For example, (1) the U.K. tax authorities
have challenged Virgin Media’s application of VAT with respect to certain revenue generating activities and in connection with
prompt payment discounts, and (2) as a result of an audit, Hungarian tax authorities have assessed our DTH operations in
Luxembourg with an obligation to pay VAT of approximately HUF 5,902.2 ($20.3 million), excluding interest and penalties, that
we are currently appealing, each as more fully described in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Because the majority of our subsidiaries have some or all of their ownership through U.S. corporations, our worldwide effective
tax rate is subject to provisions of U.S. tax law that defer the imposition of U.S. tax on certain foreign active income until that
income is repatriated to the United States. Any repatriation, through our U.S. ownership structure, of assets currently held by
subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions or recognition of income that fails to meet the U.S. tax requirements related to deferral of
U.S. income tax, may result in a higher effective tax rate for our company. While the company may mitigate this increase in its
effective tax rate through claiming a foreign tax credit against its U.S. federal income taxes or potentially have foreign or U.S.
taxes reduced under applicable income tax treaties, we are subject to various limitations.

     We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, including treaties
between the U.K., the U.S. and the many other jurisdictions in which we have a presence. Also, various income tax proposals in
the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are calculated. A
change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher income or non-
income tax expense. Any such material changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate, such as the new corporate
rate enacted in the U.K. in November 2015, as more fully described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included
in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the base erosion and
profit shifting (BEPS) project being undertaken by the OECD. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that
encompass most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, is undertaking studies and publishing action plans that include
recommendations aimed at addressing what they believe are issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by companies.
It is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to the BEPS initiative or their own concerns by enacting tax
legislation that could adversely affect us or our shareholders through increasing our tax liabilities.
                                                                 I-55
Factors Relating to Certain Financial Matters

     Our substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects. We seek to
maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally
seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that is between
four and five times our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA (as defined in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in
Part II of this Annual Report). As a result, we are highly leveraged. At December 31, 2015, our outstanding consolidated debt
and capital lease obligations aggregated $47.1 billion, including $2,537.9 million that is classified as current in our consolidated
balance sheet and $42.0 billion that is not due until 2021 or thereafter. We believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or
refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during
the next 12 months. As our debt maturities grow in later years, however, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise
extend our debt maturities. In this regard, we completed refinancing transactions in 2015 that, among other things, resulted in the
extension of certain of our subsidiaries’ debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete additional
refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is difficult to predict how political and economic
conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments will impact the credit and equity markets we access
and our future financial position.

     Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements
and indentures of certain of our subsidiaries is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted OIBDA of
our subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. For example, if the
Adjusted OIBDA of our subsidiary, UPC Broadband Holding, were to decline, we could be required to partially repay or limit our
borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with applicable covenants.
Accordingly, if our cash provided by operations declines or we encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required
to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come
due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund working capital needs,
acquisitions, property and equipment additions, or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any
additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or at all. During
2015, we purchased $2,344.5 million (including direct acquisition costs) of Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares and Old Liberty
Global Class C ordinary shares. Any cash used by our company in connection with any future purchases of our ordinary shares
would not be available for other purposes, including the repayment of debt.

     Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various debt instruments that contain restrictions on how we finance our operations
and operate our businesses, which could impede our ability to engage in beneficial transactions. Certain of our subsidiaries
are subject to significant financial and operating restrictions contained in outstanding credit agreements, indentures and similar
instruments of indebtedness. These restrictions will affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things,
the ability of those subsidiaries to:

    •    incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

    •    pay dividends or make other upstream distributions;

    •    make investments;

    •    transfer, sell or dispose of certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

    •    merge or consolidate with other entities;

    •    engage in transactions with us or other affiliates; or

    •    create liens on their assets.

    As a result of restrictions contained in these debt instruments, the companies party thereto, and their subsidiaries, could be
unable to obtain additional capital in the future to:

    •    fund property and equipment additions or acquisitions that could improve their value;

    •    meet their loan and capital commitments to their business affiliates;

    •    invest in companies in which they would otherwise invest;


                                                                  I-56
    •    fund any operating losses or future development of their business affiliates;

    •    obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize
         their assets; or

    •    conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities.

    In addition, most of the credit agreements to which these subsidiaries are parties include financial covenants that require them
to maintain certain financial ratios, including ratios of total debt to Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA to interest expense.
Their ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by adverse economic, competitive, or regulatory developments
and other events beyond their control, and we cannot assure you that these financial covenants will be met. In the event of a
default under such subsidiaries’ credit agreements or indentures, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under
those agreements or indentures, which could result in a default under other outstanding credit facilities or indentures. We cannot
assure you that any of these subsidiaries will have sufficient assets to pay indebtedness outstanding under their credit agreements
and indentures. Any refinancing of this indebtedness is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants.

     We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the debt service obligation of our subsidiaries.
We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries,
which are indexed to EURIBOR, LIBOR or other base rates. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage
exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost
or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market
interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated
with our leveraged capital structure.

     We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks, which may adversely affect our earnings. While our
operations attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in programming and operating costs, there is no assurance
that they will be able to do so. In certain countries in which we operate, our ability to increase subscription rates is subject to
regulatory controls. Also, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by competitive pressures. Therefore,
operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and net earnings
(loss). We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs in certain of our
markets.

     Continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in the global economy and in the countries in which we operate may
adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current macroeconomic environment is highly
volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including the ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues,
the risk of deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. Future
developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU
Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the eurozone. As a result, we cannot
predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which we operate may deteriorate.
Additional risks arising from the ongoing economic challenges in Europe are described below under the Risk Factor titled: We
are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial
condition and cash flows.

     Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our subscribers and/or the prices we are able to charge
for our products and services, and, as a result, it may be (1) more difficult for us to attract new subscribers, (2) more likely that
subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (3) more difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Countries
may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our company.
Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, RGUs, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA
margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain
or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.

     We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial
condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For
example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several European countries in which we operate, combined with weak
growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign
debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit
and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. With regard to currency instability issues,
concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect
to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific
fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to
                                                                I-57
the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these
countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result
in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new
currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of our assets, liabilities and
cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination
event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event
would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone countries, which in turn could
have an adverse impact on demand for our products and services, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any
changes from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing and
other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a time frame that would
allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we
have to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination
event could have a material adverse impact on our company.

     Concerns also exist with respect to the Puerto Rico government’s cash flows and, accordingly, its ability to meet its debt
obligations. For example, the Puerto Rico government failed to make bond payments of $58 million in August 2015 and $36
million in January 2016. Before the first payment default, the Puerto Rico government enacted a new tax law that, among other
things, (1) increased the sales and use tax rate from 7.0% to 11.5%, effective July 1, 2015, and (2) provided for the taxing of
services between businesses at a rate of 4%, effective October 1, 2015. Effective April 1, 2016, the aforementioned sales and use
tax will be replaced with a VAT of 10.5% and a sales and use tax of 1.0%. Prior to the new tax law, such services were exempt
from taxation. More changes to the Puerto Rico tax system are expected during 2016. Puerto Rico’s government is also currently
implementing austerity and a number of other measures to improve its solvency. It remains possible, if not likely, that Puerto Rico
will be required to restructure its debt obligations to remain solvent. If the fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico were to
worsen as a result of these or other factors, (a) the population of Puerto Rico could continue to decline, reducing the future demand
for Liberty Puerto Rico’s services, and (b) the demand and ability of customers to pay for Liberty Puerto Rico’s services could be
impaired, which could have a negative impact on Liberty Puerto Rico’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

     We may not freely access the cash of our operating companies. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our
current sources of corporate liquidity include (1) our cash and cash equivalents and (2) interest and dividend income received on
our cash and cash equivalents and investments. From time to time, we also receive (1) proceeds in the form of distributions or
loan repayments from our subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets and
(3) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity securities. The ability of our operating subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory,
regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and in some cases our receipt of such payments
or advances may be limited due to tax considerations or the presence of noncontrolling interests. Most of our operating subsidiaries
are subject to credit agreements or indentures that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the
making of distributions, loans or advances to shareholders and partners, including us. In addition, because these subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities they have no obligation to provide us funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends,
distributions, loans or other payments.

     We are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparties to our derivative and other financial instruments, undrawn debt
facilities and cash investments. Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our derivative and other financial
instruments, cash investments and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that our counterparties could default on their
obligations to us. Also, even though we regularly review our credit exposures, defaults may arise from events or circumstances
that are difficult to detect or foresee. At December 31, 2015, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (1) derivative assets
with an aggregate fair value of $2,025.2 million, (2) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,110.0 million and
(3) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of $3,910.6 million. While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness
of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, the current economic conditions and uncertainties in global
financial markets have increased the credit risk of our counterparties and we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of
our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect
on our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (1) the financial failure of any of our
counterparties could reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and adversely impact our ability to access cash
deposited with any failed financial institution, thereby causing a default under one or more derivative contracts, and (2) tightening
of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.

    Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination

                                                                 I-58
payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty.
Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed
to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty,
even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our
ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we
will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value
of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty.

     The risks we would face in the event of a default by a counterparty to one of our derivative instruments might be eliminated
or substantially mitigated if we were able to novate the relevant derivative contracts to a new counterparty following the default
of our counterparty. While we anticipate that, in the event of the insolvency of one of our derivative counterparties, we would
seek to effect such novations, no assurance can be given that we would obtain the necessary consents to do so or that we would
be able to do so on terms or pricing that would be acceptable to us or that any such novation would not result in substantial costs
to us. Furthermore, the underlying risks that are the subject of the relevant derivative contracts would no longer be effectively
hedged due to the insolvency of our counterparty, unless and until we novate or replace the derivative contract.

     We may not report net earnings. We reported losses from continuing operations of $1,049.5 million, $980.9 million and
$882.0 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In light of our historical financial performance, we cannot assure you
that we will report net earnings in the near future or ever.

Risks Related to Our Equity Capital Structure
      Holders of LiLAC ordinary shares and Liberty Global ordinary shares are shareholders of Liberty Global and are,
therefore, subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both LiLAC
ordinary shares and Liberty Global ordinary shares. Even though we have attributed, for financial reporting purposes, all of our
consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to either the LiLAC Group or the Liberty Global Group in order
to prepare the attributed financial information for each of those groups, we retain legal title to all of our assets and our capitalization
does not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement
schedules. Holders of LiLAC ordinary shares and Liberty Global ordinary shares do not have any legal rights related to specific
assets attributed to either group and, in any liquidation, holders of LiLAC ordinary shares and Liberty Global ordinary shares will
be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net assets based on their respective numbers of liquidation units.
       Our board of directors’ ability to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities between the Liberty Global Group and the
LiLAC Group may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of the LiLAC Group and/or the Liberty Global Group based
on past performance. Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are
attributed to either the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group to the other group, without the approval of any of our shareholders.
Any such reattribution made by our board of directors, as well as the existence of the right in and of itself to effect a reattribution,
may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of either group, including liquidity and capital resource needs,
based on past performance. Shareholders may also have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of one group based
on past performance, as our board of directors may use the other group’s liquidity to fund such group’s liquidity and capital
expenditure requirements through the use of inter-group loans or other inter-group arrangements.
       We could be required to use assets attributed to one group to satisfy liabilities attributed to the other group. The assets
attributed to the LiLAC Group are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to the Liberty Global Group, even if those liabilities
arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to the Liberty Global Group. While our proposed management
and allocation policies provide that reattributions of assets between groups will result in the creation of an inter-group loan or an
inter-group interest or an offsetting reattribution of cash or other assets, no provision of our articles of association prevents us
from satisfying liabilities of the Liberty Global Group with assets of the LiLAC Group, and our creditors will not in any way be
limited by our equity capital structure from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have
such a structure. Holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares may face similar considerations in that assets attributed to the Liberty
Global Group may be required to be used to satisfy liabilities attributed to the LiLAC Group.
       The market price of the ordinary shares of each group may not reflect the performance of the respective group. We cannot
assure you that the market price of the LiLAC ordinary shares will, in fact, reflect the performance of the group of businesses,
assets and liabilities attributed to the LiLAC Group. Holders of LiLAC ordinary shares will be ordinary shareholders of our
company as a whole and, as such, will be subject to all risks (and many of the corresponding benefits) associated with an investment
in our company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of each class of LiLAC ordinary shares
may be affected by the performance or financial condition of our company as a whole. An adverse market reaction to events
relating to the assets and businesses attributed to the Liberty Global Group, such as earnings announcements or announcements
                                                                   I-59
of new products or services, acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may have an adverse effect on
the market price of LiLAC ordinary shares. Holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares may face similar considerations in that the
price of the Liberty Global ordinary shares may not reflect the performance of the Liberty Global Group alone and may reflect
the performance or financial condition of our company as a whole.
      The market price of LiLAC ordinary shares may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially and could be affected by factors
that do not affect traditional ordinary shares. To the extent the market price of LiLAC ordinary shares tracks the performance
of more focused groups of businesses, assets and liabilities than the Old Liberty Global Ordinary Shares did prior to the LiLAC
Transaction, the market prices of any class of LiLAC ordinary shares may be more volatile than the market price of Old Liberty
Global Ordinary Shares historically was. The market price of LiLAC ordinary shares could also be more sensitive to events or
developments that are material only for the LiLAC Group but would not be material for our company as a whole. The market
price of LiLAC ordinary shares may be materially affected by, among other things:


      •     a potential discount that investors may apply because the LiLAC ordinary shares are issued by a common enterprise,
            rather than a standalone company;

      •     actual or anticipated fluctuations in the LiLAC Group’s operating results or in the operating results of particular
            companies attributable to the group;

      •     events or developments affecting the countries or regions in which the businesses attributed to the LiLAC Group
            operate;

      •     potential acquisition activity in the LiLAC Group;

      •     issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by us or the companies in which we invest and the manner in
            which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to the LiLAC Group;

      •     changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding the LiLAC ordinary shares or the businesses attributed
            to the LiLAC Group;

      •     the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of the LiLAC ordinary
            shares, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in our shares;

      •     the lack of market familiarity with tracking shares issued by an English publicly-traded company and of directly
            applicable legal precedent, given we are not aware of any other English publicly-traded company that has issued
            such shares; and

      •     general market conditions.

       We have not historically paid any cash dividends, and we may not pay dividends equally or at all on any class of our
ordinary shares. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on any class of our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future.
However, we have the right to pay dividends, effect securities distributions or make bonus issues on the shares of each of the
Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends, effect securities distributions
or make bonus issues on the shares of one group and not pay dividends, effect securities distributions or make bonus issues on shares
of the other group. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to either group will reduce our
“distributable reserves” (defined as our accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses, as measured for U.K.
statutory purposes) legally available to be paid as dividends by our company under English law on any of our ordinary shares,
including on the ordinary shares relating to the other group.

      The fiduciary requirements on our board of directors may in certain circumstances mean that our board of directors
makes decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of our shares or that have a disparate impact on holders of any
of our shares. Our equity capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of Liberty Global ordinary
shares might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of LiLAC ordinary shares. The Liberty Global Group and
the LiLAC Group are not separate entities and thus holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares and LiLAC ordinary shares do not
have the right to elect separate boards of directors. As a result, our company’s directors owe fiduciary duties under English law
to our company as a whole as opposed to only particular shareholders or groups of shareholders, provided that the board’s actions
are not found to be unfairly prejudicial to a shareholder’s interests. Decisions deemed to promote the success of the company for
the benefit of its shareholders as a whole or otherwise deemed to be in the best interest of our company and all of our shareholders

                                                                I-60
could be viewed as not being in the best interest of particular shareholders or groups of shareholders when considered independently.
Examples include:


      •     decisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the Liberty Global Group and the
            LiLAC Group or the terms of any reattributions of businesses, assets and liabilities between the groups;

      •     decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares and LiLAC ordinary
            shares, or among the classes of shares relating to either of our groups, to be received in connection with a scheme of
            arrangement involving our company;

      •     decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might
            meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;

      •     decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to
            the other;

      •     decisions resulting in the redesignation, or conversion, of LiLAC ordinary shares into Liberty Global ordinary shares
            or deferred shares;

      •     decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any inter-group interest or
            loan that one group may have in or to the other group;

      •     decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of our
            groups;

      •     decisions as to the dispositions of assets of either of our groups; and

      •     decisions as to the payment of dividends on the shares or share buybacks relating to either of our groups.

      Our directors’ or officers’ ownership of LiLAC ordinary shares and Liberty Global ordinary shares may create or appear
to create conflicts of interest. If our directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in LiLAC
ordinary shares or Liberty Global ordinary shares, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they
are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of LiLAC ordinary shares or Liberty Global ordinary
shares.

       Our management and allocation policies give our board of directors significant discretion. Our board of directors has
adopted, after shareholder approval, certain management and allocation policies to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding
the relationships between the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits,
inter-group loans, inter-group interests, attribution of assets, financing alternatives, corporate opportunities, payment of dividends
and similar items. Our management and allocation policies give our board of directors significant discretion and are subject to
change by the board of directors without further shareholder approval. Under these policies, the board of directors has discretion
with respect to the recognition or adjustment of inter-group interests that the Liberty Global Group may be treated as holding in
the LiLAC Group. The board’s discretion also extends to determining if, how and to what extent such inter-group interests will
be taken into account in connection with any dividend or other distribution on the LiLAC ordinary shares, redesignation, or
conversion, of LiLAC ordinary shares or any other transaction affecting the LiLAC ordinary shares. In making such determination,
our board of directors may consider any factor that it deems appropriate, including without limitation, the tax effects of any event
or transaction or the use of tax benefits. All determinations made by our board of directors in this regard will be final and binding
on all holders of our ordinary shares. The broad discretion that these policies accord our board of directors also extends to other
matters, including how future corporate opportunities that may present themselves in Latin America, Europe or elsewhere will be
allocated between the LiLAC Group and the Liberty Global Group.

       Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, elect to redesignate, or convert, all of the LiLAC ordinary shares into
Liberty Global ordinary shares, thereby changing the nature of the investment of holders of LiLAC ordinary shares and possibly
diluting their economic interest in our company, which could result in a loss of value to them. Our articles of association permit
our board of directors, in its sole discretion, to redesignate, or convert, all of the LiLAC ordinary shares into Liberty Global
ordinary shares. There is no current plan or intention to redesignate, or convert, the LiLAC ordinary shares into Liberty Global
ordinary shares. Our board of directors may elect to exercise this authority at any time if it determines that such redesignation is
in the best interests of the company and all of our shareholders. This could occur, for example, if our board of directors determines
                                                                 I-61
that the aggregate equity valuation of our company would be increased by eliminating the separate LiLAC ordinary shares, or in
connection with a sale or other strategic transaction. In addition, our board may determine to effect such redesignation in connection
with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the LiLAC Group. A redesignation would preclude the holders of LiLAC
ordinary shares from retaining their investment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of the LiLAC
Group. We cannot predict the impact on the market value of our shares of (1) our board of directors’ ability to effect any such
redesignation or (2) the exercise of this redesignation right by our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors may effect
such a redesignation at a time when the market value of our shares could cause the holders of the LiLAC ordinary shares to be
disadvantaged.

       Under certain circumstances, including in connection with a distribution to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares of securities
of another corporation, we may reduce the number of LiLAC ordinary shares proportionally, thereby reducing the voting power
and liquidity of such shares. Our articles of association permit us to reduce the number of LiLAC ordinary shares in connection
with certain transactions, including a distribution to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares of securities of another corporation or a
distribution to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares following a disposition of the LiLAC Group. We expect that our board of directors
would exercise this authority, in its discretion, in connection with a distribution to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares that would
materially reduce the amount of assets attributed to the LiLAC Group. The purpose of reducing the number of LiLAC ordinary
shares in this case would be to readjust the per share valuation and the aggregate voting power of the LiLAC ordinary shares to
reflect the value of the assets attributed to the LiLAC Group following such transaction. Such reduction would further decrease
the aggregate voting power of the LiLAC ordinary shares as compared to the Liberty Global ordinary shares. We cannot predict
the impact on the market value of LiLAC ordinary shares of the possibility of any such reduction in the number of such shares,
including any potential effects resulting from reduced liquidity of the remaining LiLAC ordinary shares.

      A third party could acquire control of our company pursuant to an offer to acquire some or all of the Liberty Global
ordinary shares only, leaving holders of LiLAC ordinary shares as minority shareholders. An offer to acquire shares in our
company may be structured such that the offer is made to acquire only the Liberty Global ordinary shares. If such an acquisition
of Liberty Global ordinary shares is successful, this would result in the holders of the LiLAC ordinary shares not sharing in any
control premium paid to holders of the Liberty Global ordinary shares. In that case, holders of LiLAC ordinary shares would
continue to be minority shareholders of a company with a third party majority shareholder, with no ability to vote against such a
change, participate in such offer or otherwise realize any control premium.

       Holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares or LiLAC ordinary shares may receive less consideration upon a sale of all
or substantially all of the assets attributed to that group than if that group were a separate company. We cannot assure you
whether the per share consideration to be paid to holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares or LiLAC ordinary shares in connection
with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group, as applicable, will be equal
to or more than the per share value of that share prior to or after the announcement of such a sale. In addition, if the the Liberty
Global Group or the LiLAC Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain
costs of that sale, including corporate level or withholding or other cross-border taxes, might not be payable in connection with
that acquisition. As a result, shareholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount
of proceeds than the holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares or LiLAC ordinary shares, as applicable, would receive upon a sale
of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to such group. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-
free to the holders of the shares relating to that group. Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the
Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group, the holders of the Liberty Global ordinary shares or LiLAC ordinary shares, as
applicable, could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in our company.

       Certain protections that our articles of association provide to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares in connection with a sale
of not less than 80% of the fair value of the assets of, or equity interests in, the LiLAC Group may not apply if we do not have
sufficient distributable reserves or share premium available following such disposition. Our articles of association provide that
in connection with a disposition of not less than 80% of the fair value of the assets of, or equity interests in, the LiLAC Group,
subject to certain exempt dispositions, our board of directors will be required to distribute cash or other assets with a fair value
equal to the available net proceeds of such disposition to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares (with or without a concurrent proportional
reduction in the number of outstanding LiLAC ordinary shares), redesignate, or convert, a portion of LiLAC ordinary shares into
Liberty Global ordinary shares at a 10% premium, or do a combination of the foregoing. However, our company’s ability to take
any of such actions at the time may depend (and in the case of a dividend or other distribution, will depend) on the availability of
sufficient distributable reserves for the payment of a dividend or other distribution or sufficient share premium required for the
creation of additional shares. If sufficient distributable reserves or share premium are not available at the time of the disposition,
our board of directors will be permitted to effect the disposition without distributing an amount equal to the net proceeds of such
disposition to holders of LiLAC ordinary shares or redesignating LiLAC ordinary shares into Liberty Global ordinary shares,
subject to the board’s fiduciary duties.

                                                                  I-62
       In the event of a liquidation of Liberty Global, neither holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares nor holders of LiLAC
ordinary shares will have priority with respect to the assets attributed to the respective group remaining for distribution to
shareholders. Under our articles of association, upon Liberty Global’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the LiLAC
ordinary shares will be entitled to receive, in respect of their respective shares, their proportionate interest in all of Liberty Global’s
assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of ordinary shares in proportion to their respective number of “liquidation
units.” Relative liquidation units were determined based on the volume weighted average prices of the Liberty Global ordinary
shares and the LiLAC ordinary shares over the 20 trading-day period commencing shortly after the commencement of ordinary-
course (regular-way) trading of the LiLAC Shares. Pursuant to the terms of our articles of association, the liquidation units for
each Liberty Global Share and each LiLAC Share are 1 and 0.94893, respectively. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder
of LiLAC ordinary shares upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Liberty Global will not directly relate to the value of
the assets attributed to the LiLAC Group and will not reflect changes in the relative value of the Liberty Global Group and the
LiLAC Group over time. Holders of the Liberty Global ordinary shares may face similar considerations in the event of a liquidation
in that any distribution to them upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up may not directly relate to the value of the assets
attributed to the Liberty Global Group and will not reflect changes to the relative values of the groups over time.

       Holders of LiLAC ordinary shares have separate voting rights only on a limited set of matters and could be outvoted by
holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares on all other matters. Holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares and LiLAC ordinary
shares vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by our articles of association or as required
by English law. Each Class B ordinary share of each group has ten votes, and each Class A ordinary share of each group has
one vote. Holders of Class C ordinary shares of each group have no voting rights at general meetings of the company or meetings
of all of the shares relating to one group. When holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares and LiLAC ordinary shares vote together
as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes (or 75%, in the case of a vote requiring a special resolution) present and
voting will be in a position to control the outcome of the vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our shareholders
or has a greater impact on one group than the other. As of February 4, 2016, holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares collectively
directed approximately 95% of the aggregate voting power in our company, and holders of LiLAC ordinary shares collectively
directed approximately 5% of the aggregate voting power in our company.

       Our equity capital structure, as well as the fact that the LiLAC Group and the Liberty Global Group are not independent
companies, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for either group and may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us,
even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. If the LiLAC Group and the Liberty Global Group were separate
independent companies, any person interested in acquiring the LiLAC Group or the Liberty Global Group without negotiating
with management could seek control of that group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting shares, by means of a tender
offer, or by means of a scheme of arrangement. Although we intend for the LiLAC ordinary shares to reflect the separate economic
performance of the LiLAC Group, neither the LiLAC Group nor the Liberty Global Group are separate entities, and a person
interested in acquiring only one group without negotiating with our management could obtain control of that group only by
obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding voting shares of our company. The existence of shares,
and different classes of shares, relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles,
financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have capital structures similar to ours.

Other Factors

    The loss of certain key personnel could harm our business. We have experienced employees at both the corporate and
operational levels who possess substantial knowledge of our business and operations. We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue
costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions in our business operations,
which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

     John C. Malone has significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our shareholders. John C.
Malone beneficially owns outstanding ordinary shares of Liberty Global representing 24.9% of our aggregate voting power as of
February 4, 2016. By virtue of Mr. Malone’s voting power in our company, as well as his position as Chairman of our board of
directors, Mr. Malone may have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to
our shareholders for approval. For example, under English law and our articles of association, certain matters (including
amendments to the articles of association) require the approval of 75% of the shareholders who vote (in person or by proxy) on
the relevant resolution, and other certain corporate transactions or matters may require the approval of at least 75% of the outstanding
shares of each class of our ordinary shares. Because Mr. Malone beneficially owns approximately 25% of our aggregate voting
power and more than 75% of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares of each of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group,
he has the ability to prevent the requisite approval threshold from being met even though the other shareholders may determine
that such action or transaction is beneficial for the Company. Mr. Malone’s rights to vote or dispose of his equity interests in our


                                                                   I-63
company are not subject to any restrictions in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary
transfer restrictions pursuant to equity award agreements.

    It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions
of our articles of association and of English law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company that a
shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:

    •    authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of ordinary shares: two tracking groups, each with a Class B that
         entitles the holders to 10 votes per share; a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share; and a Class C that,
         except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holder to no voting rights;

    •    authorizing the issuance of “blank check” shares (both ordinary and preference), which could be issued by our board of
         directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;

    •    classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control
         of our board of directors, although under English law, shareholders of our company can remove a director without cause
         by ordinary resolution;

    •    prohibiting shareholder action by written resolution, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of
         the shareholders;

    •    requiring the approval of 75% in value of the shareholders (or class of shareholders) and/or English court approval for
         certain statutory mergers or schemes of arrangements; and

    •    establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for
         proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.

    Change in control provisions in our incentive plan and related award agreements may also discourage, delay, or prevent a
change in control of our company, even if such change of control would be in the best interests of our shareholders.

     The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult. Because we are a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S.
courts than would currently be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. It may also be more difficult (or
impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts sitting in England than it would be to bring similar claims against
a U.S. company in a U.S. court. In particular, English law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of
English companies may bring derivative actions. Under English law generally, only the Company can be the proper plaintiff in
proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against us. Our articles of association provide for the exclusive jurisdiction of
the English courts for shareholder lawsuits against us or our directors.

Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

    None.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

    During 2015, we leased our corporate offices in London, U.K., in Englewood, Colorado, U.S. and in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. All of our other real or personal property is owned or leased by our subsidiaries and affiliates.

     Our subsidiaries and affiliates own or lease the fixed assets necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, including
office space, transponder space, headend facilities, rights of way, cable television and telecommunications distribution equipment,
telecommunications switches and customer premises equipment and other property necessary for their operations. The physical
components of their broadband networks require maintenance and periodic upgrades to support the new services and products
they introduce. Subject to these maintenance and upgrade activities, our management believes that our current facilities are suitable
and adequate for our business operations for the foreseeable future.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, our subsidiaries and affiliates have become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of their
operations in the normal course of business. For additional information, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in
Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

     We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services, with consolidated
operations at December 31, 2015 in 14 countries. Through Virgin Media, we provide video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony
and mobile services in the U.K. and Ireland. Through Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia and Telenet, we provide video, broadband
internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, respectively. Through UPC Holding,
we provide (i) video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in seven other European countries and (ii) mobile
services in four other European countries. The operations of Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia, Telenet and UPC
Holding are collectively referred to herein as the “European Operations Division.” In Chile, we provide video, broadband internet,
fixed-line telephony and mobile services through VTR. In Puerto Rico, we provide video, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services through Liberty Puerto Rico.

    On July 1, 2015, we completed the LiLAC Transaction, pursuant to which we (i) reclassified our then outstanding Old Liberty
Global Shares into Liberty Global Shares and (ii) distributed LiLAC Shares to holders of our Old Liberty Global Shares. The
Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are intended to reflect or “track” the economic performance of the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group, respectively. For additional information, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

    Our analog video service offerings include basic programming and, in some markets, expanded basic programming. We tailor
both our basic channel line-up and our additional channel offerings to each market according to culture, demographics, programming
preferences and local regulation. Our digital video service offerings include basic and premium programming and incremental
product and service offerings such as enhanced pay-per-view programming (including video-on-demand or “VoD”), digital video
recorders and high definition programming.

     We have launched “Horizon TV” in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland and Germany and cloud-based Horizon TV in
Poland and the Czech Republic, and during 2016, we expect to launch Horizon TV products in Austria, Chile and certain markets
in our Central and Eastern Europe segment. In the U.K. and Belgium, we offer interactive digital television platforms that are
comparable to Horizon TV under the brand names “Tivo” and “Digital TV”, respectively. Horizon TV is a family of media products
that allows customers to view and share content across the television, computer, tablet and smart phone. Horizon TV is powered
by a user interface that provides customers with a seamless and intuitive way to access linear, time-shifted (including “Replay
TV”), on-demand and web-based content on the television. It also features an advanced set-top box that delivers not only video,
but also internet and voice connections along with a wireless network for the home. The Horizon family of products also includes
“Horizon Go” (or “TV Anywhere” in the U.K. and “Yelo Play” in Belgium), an online television app for viewing on a second
screen that allows video customers to view linear channels, with many channels available outside of the home. Horizon Go also
offers access to VoD and, for Horizon TV customers, the second screen devices also act as an in-home remote control. Using the
Horizon Go app, customers in certain markets can watch Replay TV, which provides access to programs from the past seven days
on their smart phones or laptops. We expect to expand the availability of Replay TV to additional markets during 2016. In addition,
we have launched our subscriber-video-on-demand offering, which we refer to as “MyPrime”, in many of our markets. MyPrime

                                                                 II-6
is a subscription-based on-demand video library that allows customers to choose from several thousand classic films, children’s
programs, series and documentaries.

     Although our digital television signals are encrypted in many of the countries in which we operate, our basic digital television
channels in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are unencrypted.
Where our basic digital television channels are unencrypted, subscribers who have the necessary equipment and who pay the
monthly subscription fee for our analog package are able to watch our basic digital television channels. Regardless of whether
basic digital television channels are offered on an unencrypted basis, expanded channel packages and premium channels and
services continue to be available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets. In markets where we introduce unencryption,
we generally expect to experience a positive impact on our subscriber disconnect levels and a somewhat negative impact on demand
for lower tiers of digital video services.

     We offer broadband internet services in all of our broadband communications markets. Our residential subscribers and B2B
customers generally access the internet at various download speeds ranging up to 500 Mbps, depending on the market and the tier
of service selected. We determine pricing for each tier of broadband internet service through analysis of speed, market conditions
and other factors.

    We offer fixed-line telephony services in all of our broadband communications markets, primarily using voice-over-internet-
protocol or “VoIP” technology. In addition, we offer mobile services using third-party networks in most of our markets.

    Most of our operations also provide B2B services, including voice, broadband internet, data, video, wireless and cloud services.

     We have completed a number of transactions that impact the comparability of our 2015, 2014 and 2013 results of operations,
including the Choice Acquisition on June 3, 2015, the Ziggo Acquisition on November 11, 2014, the Virgin Media Acquisition on
June 7, 2013 and a number of less significant acquisitions during 2015, 2014 and 2013.

    On January 31, 2014, we completed the Chellomedia Transaction and, accordingly, the Chellomedia Disposal Group is
presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all applicable periods. In the following discussion
and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those
of our continuing operations, unless otherwise indicated.

    For further information regarding our pending and completed acquisitions and our dispositions, see notes 4, 5 and 20 to our
consolidated financial statements.

    Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we are the largest international broadband communications operator in terms of
customers. At December 31, 2015, we owned and operated networks that passed 53,392,100 homes and served 57,047,900 revenue
generating units (RGUs), consisting of 24,046,000 video subscribers, 18,120,400 broadband internet subscribers and 14,881,500
fixed-line telephony subscribers. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we served 4,787,000 mobile subscribers.

    During the first quarter of 2015, we modified certain video subscriber definitions to better align these definitions with the
underlying services received by our subscribers and have replaced our “analog cable” and “digital cable” subscriber definitions
with “basic video” and “enhanced video,” respectively. A basic video subscriber receives our video service via an analog video
signal or a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling
technology. An enhanced video subscriber receives our video service via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring
monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology.

     Including the effect of acquisitions, we added a total of 1,097,300 RGUs during 2015. Excluding the effect of acquisitions
(RGUs added on the acquisition date), but including post-acquisition date RGU additions, we added 869,900 RGUs on an organic
basis during 2015, as compared to 1,278,900 RGUs added on an organic basis during 2014. The organic RGU growth during 2015
is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase of 734,000 broadband internet RGUs, (ii) a decrease of 606,100 basic
video RGUs, (iii) an increase of 528,300 fixed-line telephony RGUs and (iv) an increase of 175,700 enhanced video RGUs. In
addition, excluding the effect of acquisitions, we added 267,600 mobile subscribers during 2015, including an increase in postpaid
mobile subscribers of 464,300 and a decrease in prepaid mobile subscribers of 196,700.




                                                                 II-7
      We are experiencing significant competition from incumbent telecommunications operators (particularly in the Netherlands
and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland, where the incumbent telecommunications operators are overbuilding our networks with fiber-
to-the-home, -cabinet, -building or -node and advanced digital subscriber line technologies), DTH operators and/or other providers
in all of our broadband communications markets. In certain of our markets, this significant competition, together with the maturation
of these markets, has contributed to organic declines in revenue, RGUs and/or average monthly subscription revenue per average
cable RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable (ARPU), the more notable of which include:

     (i)    organic declines in cable subscription and overall revenue in the Netherlands during the fourth quarter of 2015, as
            compared to the fourth quarter of 2014;

     (ii)   organic declines during the fourth quarter of 2015 in (a) video RGUs in the majority of our markets, as declines in our
            basic video RGUs generally exceeded additions to our enhanced video RGUs (including migrations from basic video)
            in these markets, (b) fixed-line telephony RGUs in Chile and the Netherlands and (c) total RGUs in the Netherlands
            and Switzerland/Austria; and

     (iii) organic declines in overall cable ARPU in many of our markets during the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to the
           fourth quarter of 2014.

     In addition to competition, our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control.
For example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several European countries in which we operate, combined with weak
growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign
debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit
and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. Given our significant exposure to the
euro, the occurrence of any of these events within the eurozone countries could have an adverse impact on, among other matters,
our liquidity and cash flows.

     Concerns also exist with respect to the Puerto Rico government’s cash flows and, accordingly, its ability to meet its debt
obligations. For example, the Puerto Rico government failed to make bond payments of $58 million in August 2015 and $36
million in January 2016. Before the first payment default, the Puerto Rico government enacted a new tax law that, among other
things, (i) increased the sales and use tax rate from 7.0% to 11.5%, effective July 1, 2015, and (ii) provided for the taxing of
services between businesses at a rate of 4%, effective October 1, 2015. Effective April 1, 2016, the aforementioned sales and use
tax will be replaced with a VAT of 10.5% and a sales and use tax of 1.0%. Prior to the new tax law, such services were exempt
from taxation. More changes to the Puerto Rico tax system are expected during 2016. Puerto Rico’s government is also currently
implementing austerity and a number of other measures to improve its solvency. It remains possible, if not likely, that Puerto Rico
will be required to restructure its debt obligations to remain solvent. If the fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico were to
worsen as a result of these or other factors, (a) the population of Puerto Rico could continue to decline, reducing the future demand
for Liberty Puerto Rico’s services, and (b) the demand and ability of customers to pay for Liberty Puerto Rico’s services could be
impaired, which could have a negative impact on Liberty Puerto Rico’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

     The video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony businesses in which we operate are capital intensive. In order to add
customers to our broadband networks and enhance our service offerings, we make significant investments in property and equipment
to upgrade and extend our broadband communications networks and improve our customer premises equipment. Significant
competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies such as fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-
building/-node and advanced digital subscriber line technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to
undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and customer premises equipment in impacted markets. In addition,
no assurance can be given that any future upgrades will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available
to finance such future upgrades. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding
or upgrading our networks, or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our property and equipment, our growth could
be limited and our competitive position could be harmed.

     We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide services to our
customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including
political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. As a result,
we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in connecting customers to our services and, accordingly,
could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows.

    From a strategic perspective, we are seeking to build broadband communications and mobile businesses that have strong
prospects for future growth in revenue, Adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow (as defined below under Liquidity and Capital
                                                            II-8
Resources — Free Cash Flow). As discussed further under Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization below, we also seek
to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk.

    We strive to achieve organic revenue and customer growth in our operations by developing and marketing bundled
entertainment and information and communications services, and extending and upgrading the quality of our networks where
appropriate. As we use the term, organic growth excludes foreign currency translation effects (FX) and the estimated impact of
acquisitions. While we seek to obtain new customers, we also seek to maximize the average revenue we receive from each household
by increasing the penetration of our digital video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services with existing
customers through product bundling and upselling.

     During 2015, we initiated our “Liberty 3.0” program, which is a comprehensive plan to drive top-line growth while maintaining
tight cost controls. The Liberty 3.0 program seeks to capitalize on revenue opportunities associated with Network Extensions (as
defined and described below), mobile and B2B, together with the realization of greater efficiencies by leveraging our scale more
effectively. Underpinning this program is a commitment to customer centricity, which we believe is key to succeeding in an ever
more demanding consumer market. We expect this transformation to occur over the next several years and, as with any program
of this magnitude, the benefits are expected to materialize over time. We believe that the successful implementation of Liberty
3.0 will, beginning in 2017, lead to consolidated organic growth rates for revenue and Adjusted OIBDA that are meaningfully
higher than our recent consolidated organic growth rates. We expect our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA growth to come primarily
from (i) organic increases in RGUs, due in large part to the Network Extensions, (ii) increases in ARPU per customer, (iii) growth
in B2B and mobile services and (iv) in the case of our Adjusted OIBDA growth rates, cost savings and efficiencies that are expected
to largely offset the incremental costs that we will incur as a result of a larger subscriber base. As further discussed below, we
expect the percentage of revenue represented by our property and equipment additions to increase during this period as a result
of the Network Extensions.

     During 2015, we initiated a network extension program in the U.K. (the U.K. Network Extension) pursuant to which we
may connect up to an estimated four million additional homes and businesses to Virgin Media’s broadband communications
network by the end of 2019. In addition, we plan to pursue similar opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe, Germany, Chile
and certain other markets, pursuant to which we may connect up to an estimated six million homes to our networks in these markets
through 2019 (together with the U.K. Network Extension, the Network Extensions). The additional premises that we expect to
connect pursuant to the Network Extensions were identified through a detailed review of our existing network in these markets
and were selected based on our assessment that attractive returns could be achieved. The Network Extensions will be completed
in phases and will initially focus on the most accretive expansion opportunities. Depending on a variety of factors, including the
financial and operational results of the earlier phases of the programs, any of the Network Extensions may be modified or cancelled
at our discretion.

     The capital costs associated with the Network Extensions, which include the costs to build-out the networks and the purchase
and installation of related customer premises equipment, are expected to be significant. Based on our most recent long-range plan,
which excludes BASE and CWC, and including the aggregate impact on our revenue and property and equipment additions of
the Network Extensions, we expect that the percentage of revenue represented by our aggregate consolidated property and
equipment additions will range from 25% to 28% during the three years ended December 31, 2018.

     Our assessment of the impacts of the Liberty 3.0 program (including the impacts of the Network Extensions) are subject to
competitive, economic, regulatory and other factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that we will be successful
in delivering growth rates that are meaningfully higher than our recent consolidated organic growth rates for revenue and Adjusted
OIBDA.

    For additional information regarding our property and equipment additions, including our expectations for 2016, see Liquidity
and Capital Resources — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.

Results of Operations

      As noted under Overview above, the comparability of our operating results during 2015, 2014 and 2013 is affected by
acquisitions. In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of acquisitions on our operating results. The acquisition
impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results of the periods under comparison that is attributable
to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the acquisition impact on an acquired entity’s operating results during the
first three months following the acquisition date such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are considered
to be organic changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, variances attributed to an acquired entity during the first 12 months
following the acquisition date represent differences between the estimated acquisition impact and the actual results. Our organic
growth percentages may be impacted by the fact that the numerator for the organic growth percentages includes the organic growth
of the acquired entity, while the denominator may not include any amounts related to the acquired entity. Normally, any such
impacts would not be significant, however, due to the size of the Virgin Media Acquisition, our consolidated organic growth rates
for 2014, as compared to 2013, are significantly different from the growth rates we would have reported if we had excluded Virgin
Media’s organic growth from these organic growth rate calculations. Accordingly, to provide an additional perspective on (i) the
growth of the components of our consolidated revenue and (ii) changes in our operating expenses, SG&A expenses and Adjusted
OIBDA for such periods, we present (a) organic revenue growth rates that exclude Virgin Media’s organic growth in a note to our
consolidated product revenue table included under Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results and (b) the
organic changes of our consolidated operating expenses, SG&A expenses and Adjusted OIBDA excluding the impact of Virgin
Media in a note to the respective tables that are included in Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments.

     Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as all of our operating
segments, except for Puerto Rico, have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to FX risk during
the three months ended December 31, 2015 was to the euro and British pound sterling as 43.8% and 37.0% of our U.S. dollar
revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and British pound sterling,
respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Swiss franc and
other local currencies in Europe, as well as the Chilean peso. The portions of the changes in the various components of our results
of operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments
and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below. For information concerning our foreign currency risks
and the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the periods covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below.

    The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100% of each operating segment’s revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. As
we have the ability to control Telenet and Liberty Puerto Rico, we consolidate 100% of the revenue and expenses of these entities
in our consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that third parties own significant interests in these entities. The
noncontrolling owners’ interests in the operating results of Telenet, Liberty Puerto Rico and other less significant majority-owned
subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations.




                                                                 II-10
Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments

  General

     All of the reportable segments set forth below derive their revenue primarily from broadband communications services,
including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services. Most of our reportable segments also provide B2B and
mobile services. For detailed information regarding the composition of our reportable segments, including information regarding
a change to our reportable segments that we made during the second quarter of 2015, see note 18 to our consolidated financial
statements.

     The tables presented below in this section provide a separate analysis of each of the line items that comprise Adjusted OIBDA,
as further discussed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements, as well as an analysis of Adjusted OIBDA by reportable
segment for (i) 2015, as compared to 2014, and (ii) 2014, as compared to 2013. These tables present (a) the amounts reported by
each of our reportable segments for the current and comparative periods, (b) the U.S. dollar change and percentage change from
period to period and (c) the organic percentage change from period to period (percentage change after removing FX and the
estimated impacts of acquisitions and dispositions). The comparisons that exclude FX assume that exchange rates remained constant
at the prior year rate during the comparative periods that are included in each table. As discussed under Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below, we have significant exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. We also provide a table showing the Adjusted OIBDA margins of our reportable segments for 2015, 2014 and
2013 at the end of this section.

     The revenue of our reportable segments includes revenue earned from (i) subscribers to our broadband communications and
mobile services and (ii) B2B services, interconnect fees, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fees, installation fees, late fees,
and advertising revenue. Consistent with the presentation of our revenue categories in note 18 to our consolidated financial
statements, we use the term “subscription revenue” in the following discussion to refer to amounts received from subscribers for
ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late fees. In the following tables, mobile subscription revenue excludes the related
interconnect revenue.

     Most of our revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer VAT or similar revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these
taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such
tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience
increases in our operating expenses and corresponding declines in our Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margins to the
extent of any such tax increases.

     We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers terminate on
another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from their customers terminate on
our networks or networks that we access through MVNO or other arrangements. The amounts we charge and incur with respect
to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are subject to regulatory oversight in many of our markets. To the extent
that regulatory authorities introduce fixed-line or mobile termination rate changes, we would experience prospective changes and,
in very limited cases, we could experience retroactive changes in our interconnect revenue and/or costs. The ultimate impact of
any such changes in termination rates on our Adjusted OIBDA would be dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are
subject to the changed termination rates.




                                                                II-11

         (Ziggo) is significantly larger than our legacy operations in the Netherlands.

(c)      The amount presented for 2015 includes the post-acquisition revenue of Choice, which was acquired on June 3, 2015.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

    General. While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our reportable segments,
we are experiencing significant competition in all of our broadband communications markets. This competition has an adverse
impact on our ability to increase or maintain our RGUs and/or ARPU. For a description of the more notable recent impacts of this
competition on our broadband communications markets, see Overview above.

     Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of RGUs
or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (a) price
increases, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber
usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of cable and mobile products within a segment during the period. In the following discussion,
we provide the net impact of the above factors on the ARPU that is derived from our video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony
and mobile products.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs that was only partially offset by a decline in
         (i) the average number of enhanced video RGUs and (ii) the average number of basic and multi-channel multi-point
         (microwave) distribution system (MMDS) video RGUs in Ireland.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a
         net increase primarily due to (a) higher ARPU from broadband internet services in the U.K., (b) lower ARPU from fixed-
         line telephony services and (c) higher ARPU from video services and (ii) an adverse change in RGU mix in Ireland. In
         addition, the growth in ARPU was partially offset by (1) the impact of a January 1, 2015 change in how VAT is applied to
         certain components of our U.K. operations, which reduced revenue by $49.9 million, and (2) a May 1, 2014 change in
         legislation in the U.K. with respect to the charging of VAT in connection with prompt payment discounts, as discussed
         below, which reduced revenue by $24.0 million.

(c)      The decrease in mobile subscription revenue relates to the U.K. and is due to (i) lower ARPU, including the net impact of
         (a) a decline of $41.6 million in postpaid mobile services revenue due to the November 2014 introduction of a Split-contract
         Program, (b) a decrease of $11.2 million related to the above-described January 1, 2015 change in how VAT is applied and
         (c) an increase in revenue due to the favorable impact of a $4.4 million nonrecurring adjustment to VAT recorded during
         the fourth quarter of 2015, and (ii) a decrease in the average number of subscribers, as a decrease in the average number
         of prepaid subscribers more than offset the increase in the average number of postpaid subscribers.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to (i) an increase in data revenue, primarily attributable to (a) higher volumes
         and (b) an increase of $22.7 million in the U.K.’s amortization of deferred upfront fees on B2B contracts, (ii) an increase
         in low-margin equipment sales in the U.K. and (iii) an increase in voice revenue, largely attributable to the net effect of (1)
         an $18.2 million increase recorded in the U.K. during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of disputes with
         mobile operators over amounts charged for voice traffic, including $16.3 million related to years prior to 2015, and (2) a
         decline in usage.

(e)      The increase in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales,
         primarily attributable to a $144.6 million increase associated with the November 2014 introduction of a Split-contract
         Program, (ii) a decrease in interconnect revenue of $23.4 million, primarily due to a decline in mobile short message service

(f)      Represents the estimated impact of the non-cable subscribers in the U.K. that we sold in the fourth quarter of 2014 (the

         2015.

    On March 19, 2014, the U.K. government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection
with prompt payment discounts such as those that Virgin Media offers to its fixed-line telephony customers. This change, which
took effect on May 1, 2014, impacted Virgin Media and some of its competitors. For additional information regarding a challenge
from the U.K. government regarding Virgin Media’s application of the prompt payment discount rules prior to the May 1, 2014
change in legislation, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

      The Netherlands. The increase in the Netherlands’ revenue during 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily due to the Ziggo
Acquisition. Due to the size of the Ziggo Acquisition and the resulting impact on the organic growth rate of the Netherlands, the
below discussion and analysis of the Netherlands’ revenue is presented on a pro forma basis as if the results of Ziggo were included
along with those of Ziggo Services for 2014. The pro forma revenue amount for Ziggo is based on Ziggo’s publicly-reported results
for 2014, as adjusted to (i) convert Ziggo’s publicly-reported results from International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted
by the EU, to GAAP, (ii) conform one of Ziggo’s accounting policies to the corresponding Liberty Global accounting policy and
(iii) reflect the impact of the acquisition accounting applied to the Ziggo Acquisition. We believe this pro forma revenue analysis
provides the most meaningful comparison of the Netherlands’ revenue.

    On a pro forma basis, the Netherlands’ revenue decreased $618.1 million or 18.4% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This
decrease includes (i) a pro forma organic decrease of $82.7 million or 2.5% and (ii) the impact of FX, as set forth below:

_______________

(a)      The pro forma decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to
         a decline in the average numbers of basic video, enhanced video and fixed-line telephony RGUs that was only partially
         offset by an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs.

(b)      The pro forma decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a
         net decrease due to (a) lower ARPU from video and fixed-line telephony services and (b) higher ARPU from broadband
         internet services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The pro forma increase in mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers.

(d)      The pro forma decrease in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to (i) a decrease in revenue of $26.9 million
         resulting from the termination of a Ziggo parter network agreement shortly after the Ziggo Acquisition, (ii) a decrease in
         installation revenue and (iii) lower revenue from set-top box sales due to the fact that we stopped selling set-top boxes in
         the Netherlands during the first quarter of 2015.

_______________

(a)      Subscription revenue includes revenue from multi-year bulk agreements with landlords or housing associations or with
         third parties that operate and administer the in-building networks on behalf of housing associations. These bulk agreements,
         which generally allow for the procurement of the basic video signals at volume-based discounts, provide access to
         approximately two-thirds of Germany’s video subscribers. Germany’s bulk agreements are, to a significant extent, medium-
         and long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2015, bulk agreements covering approximately 33% of the video subscribers
         that Germany serves expire by the end of 2016 or are terminable on 30-days notice. During the three months ended
         December 31, 2015, Germany’s 20 largest bulk agreement accounts generated approximately 7% of its total revenue
         (including estimated amounts billed directly to the building occupants for digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line
         telephony services). No assurance can be given that Germany’s bulk agreements will be renewed or extended on financially
         equivalent terms or at all.

(b)      Other non-subscription revenue includes fees received for the carriage of certain channels included in Germany’s basic and
         enhanced video offerings. This channel carriage fee revenue is subject to contracts that expire or are otherwise terminable
         by either party on various dates ranging from 2016 through 2018. The aggregate amount of revenue related to these channel
         carriage contracts represented approximately 4% of Germany’s total revenue during the three months ended December 31,
         2015. No assurance can be given that these contracts will be renewed or extended on financially equivalent terms, or at all.
         Also, our ability to increase the aggregate channel carriage fees that Germany receives for each channel is limited through
         2016 by certain commitments we made to regulators in connection with the acquisition of KBW.

(c)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that was only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(d)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) higher ARPU from broadband
         internet, video and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(e)      The increase in B2B revenue is due to higher revenue from data and voice services.

(f)      The decrease in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to (i) a decrease from the unfavorable impact of $11.9
         million of nonrecurring network usage revenue that Germany recorded during the first quarter of 2014 following the
         settlement of prior period amounts, (ii) a decrease in channel carriage fee revenue of $4.9 million and (iii) a decrease in
         interconnect revenue of $4.8 million.

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs that was only partially offset

         internet, video and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to higher revenue from (i) information technology security services and
         related equipment sales, (ii) broadband internet services and (iii) voice services.

(e)      The increase in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales
         of $11.6 million, (ii) an increase in interconnect revenue of $9.2 million, primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) growth
         in mobile call volumes and (b) lower SMS usage, and (iii) a decrease in set-top box sales of $7.4 million, primarily due to
         a digital cable migration completed during the third quarter of 2014. The increase in Belgium’s mobile handset sales, which
         typically generate relatively low margins, is primarily due to the net effect of (1) an increase of $12.5 million associated
         with the June 2015 introduction of a Split-contract Program, (2) a decrease in subsidized handset sales and (3) higher
         revenue from contract termination fees applicable to subsidized handsets.

         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that was primarily offset by
         a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to an increase in ARPU in both Switzerland
         and Austria. The increase in ARPU in Switzerland is attributable to (i) an improvement in RGU mix and (ii) a net increase
         due to (a) higher ARPU from video services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services.
         The increase in ARPU in Austria is attributable to the net effect of (1) a net increase due to (I) higher ARPU from video
         and broadband internet services and (II) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (2) an adverse change in RGU
         mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of mobile subscribers
         in Switzerland. Switzerland’s mobile services were launched during the second quarter of 2014.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to a net increase in Switzerland from (i) higher revenue from voice and data
         services and (ii) lower revenue from construction services and equipment sales.

(e)      The increase in other non-subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile handset sales, which
         typically generate relatively low margins, (ii) a decrease in revenue from Austria’s non-cable subscriber base and (iii) a net
         increase resulting from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription categories.

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to the net
         effect of (i) an increase in the average numbers of enhanced video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs in
         Romania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, (ii) a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs in Poland, Hungary,
         Romania and Slovakia, (iii) an increase in the average number of DTH RGUs, (iv) a decline in the average numbers of
         fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs in the Czech Republic and (v) an increase in the average numbers of basic
         video and broadband internet RGUs in the Czech Republic.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a net decrease
         due to (a) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services, (b) lower ARPU from broadband internet services, primarily in
         Poland, and (c) higher ARPU from video services, primarily in Poland and Romania, and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.
         In addition, the decline in ARPU includes the impact of a January 1, 2015 change in how VAT is calculated for UPC DTH’s
         operations in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which reduced UPC DTH’s revenue by $16.4 million.




                                                                                            II-18

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs that was only partially offset by a decline in the
         average numbers of basic video and fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due to (a) higher
         ARPU from video and broadband internet services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (ii) an
         improvement in RGU mix. In addition, the growth in ARPU was partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the impact
         of a $2.5 million adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2015 to reflect the retroactive application of a proposed
         tariff on ancillary services provided directly to customers for the period from July 2013 through February 2014.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to (i) an increase in the average number of subscribers, as an increase
         in the average number of postpaid subscribers more than offset the decrease in the average number of prepaid subscribers,
         and (ii) higher ARPU primarily due to a higher proportion of mobile subscribers on postpaid plans, which generate higher
         ARPU than prepaid plans.

(d)      The increase in non-subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in interconnect revenue, (ii) an increase
         in installation revenue, (iii) an increase in advertising revenue and (iv) a net increase resulting from individually insignificant
         changes in other non-subscription categories. The decrease in interconnect revenue is primarily due to (a) lower rates and
         (b) a decrease of $3.0 million related to the impact of adjustments recorded during the first and third quarters of 2015 to
         reflect the retroactive application of a tariff reduction to June 2012.

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video RGUs.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily due to an adverse change in RGU mix.
         Excluding the impact of RGU mix, ARPU was relatively unchanged due to the net effect of (i) lower ARPU from fixed-
         line telephony services and (ii) higher ARPU from video and broadband internet services.

    The increase in U.K./Ireland's revenue during 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily due to the June 2013 Virgin Media
Acquisition. The organic revenue growth rate of U.K./Ireland is impacted by the size and timing of the Virgin Media Acquisition.
Accordingly, (i) we present a separate discussion and analysis for each of the U.K. and Ireland and (ii) the below discussion and
analysis of the U.K.’s revenue is presented on a pro forma basis as if the results of Virgin Media were included for the full year
2013. We believe this pro forma analysis provides a more meaningful comparison of Virgin Media’s revenue.

     U.K. During 2014, Virgin Media generated revenue of $6,941.1 million, representing a pro forma organic increase of $163.4
million or 2.5%, compared to the revenue reported by Virgin Media during 2013. This pro forma organic increase in Virgin Media’s
revenue, which represents the increase that remains after eliminating the impacts of (i) a decrease of $21.4 million associated with
the assumed alignment of Virgin Media’s policy to our policy for accounting for installation and certain nonrecurring fees received
on B2B contracts, (ii) an acquisition and (iii) FX, is attributable to the net effect of (a) an increase in cable subscription revenue
of $141.6 million or 3.2%, (b) a decrease in other non-subscription revenue of $83.5 million or 20.2%, (c) an increase in mobile
subscription revenue of $61.9 million or 9.0% and (d) an increase in non-subscription B2B revenue of $43.4 million or 4.8%.

     The pro forma organic increase during 2014 in Virgin Media’s cable subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in
ARPU and, to a lesser extent, the average number of RGUs, as an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs
was only partially offset by a decline in the average numbers of enhanced video and fixed-line telephony RGUs. The increase in
ARPU is primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher ARPU from broadband internet services and (ii) lower ARPU from fixed-
line telephony and digital video services. In addition, the growth in fixed-line telephony ARPU was partially offset by the impact
of a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection with prompt payment discounts, as discussed below.

     The pro forma organic increase in Virgin Media’s mobile subscription revenue is due to (i) higher ARPU and (ii) an increase
in the average number of subscribers, as an increase in the average number of postpaid subscribers more than offset the decrease
in the average number of prepaid subscribers. In addition, the growth in mobile subscription revenue was partially offset by the
impact of certain nonrecurring net adjustments of $6.0 million and $1.8 million during the first and second quarters of 2013,
respectively, that positively impacted 2013.

     The pro forma organic increase in Virgin Media’s non-subscription B2B revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an
increase in B2B data revenue primarily attributable to (a) increased volumes and (b) an increase of $17.8 million in the amortization
of deferred upfront fees on B2B contracts and (ii) a decline in B2B voice revenue primarily attributable to (1) lower termination
rates and (2) a decline in usage. In addition, the growth in B2B revenue also benefited from the impact of certain nonrecurring
net adjustments of $4.8 million that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2013.

     The pro forma organic decrease in Virgin Media’s other non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of
(i) a decrease in interconnect revenue, primarily due to a reduction in (a) fixed-line termination rates in February 2014 and (b)
mobile termination rates in April 2013, (ii) a decrease of $28.9 million related to a decline in Virgin Media’s non-cable subscriber
base, (iii) a decrease in installation revenue and (iv) an increase in mobile handset sales primarily attributable to the net effect of
(1) an $11.3 million increase related to the November 2014 introduction of a Split-contract Program and (2) a decrease in sales to
third-party retailers and prepaid handset sales.

    On March 19, 2014, the U.K. government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection
with prompt payment discounts such as those that Virgin Media offers to its fixed-line telephony customers. The changes, which
took effect on May 1, 2014, impacted Virgin Media and some of its competitors. As a result of this legislation, Virgin Media’s
revenue was £28.9 million ($42.6 million) lower during 2014, as compared to 2013.

     Ireland. The increase in Ireland’s revenue during 2014, as compared to 2013, includes (i) an organic increase of $5.0 million
or 1.1%, and (ii) the impact of FX, as set forth below:
                                                                                                                                                  Non-

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony and broadband internet RGUs that was only partially offset by a decline in
         the average numbers of basic video, MMDS and enhanced video RGUs.

(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) an adverse change in RGU
         mix and (ii) a net decrease primarily due to (a) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (b) higher ARPU from
         video services.

(c)      The decrease in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to a decrease in installation revenue.

    The Netherlands. The increase in the Netherlands’ revenue during 2014, as compared to 2013, includes (i) an organic decrease
of $16.3 million or 1.3%, (ii) the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition and (iii) the impact of FX, as set forth below:

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that was mostly offset by a
         decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.



                                                                                           II-23
(b)      The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to the net effect of (i) a net decrease
         due to (a) lower ARPU from broadband internet services and (b) higher ARPU from video and fixed-line telephony services
         and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The decrease in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to lower installation revenue.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video RGUs that was only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due to (a) higher
         ARPU from broadband internet services, (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (c) higher ARPU from
         video services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU.

(d)      The increase in other non-subscription revenue is attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in interconnect revenue of
         $15.6 million, primarily attributable to lower fixed-line termination rates, (ii) an increase in channel carriage fee revenue
         of $7.0 million and (iii) a net increase from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription revenue categories.
         The increase during 2014, as compared to 2013, also includes an $11.4 million increase in network usage revenue related
         to the first quarter 2014 settlement of prior year amounts.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, enhanced video and broadband internet RGUs that was only partially offset
         by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to an improvement in RGU
         mix. Excluding RGU mix, ARPU remained relatively constant primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher ARPU from
         broadband internet services and (ii) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services.

(c)      The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU.

(d)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to (i) higher revenue from voice, video and data services and (ii) higher
         wholesale revenue from mobile services.

(e)      The increase in other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in interconnect revenue
         of $12.2 million, primarily due to the net effect of (a) growth in mobile customers and (b) lower SMS usage, (ii) a decrease
         in mobile handset sales of $11.7 million and (iii) an increase in set-top box sales of $6.8 million, primarily due to a digital
         cable migration completed during the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in Belgium’s mobile handset sales, which typically
         generate relatively low margins, is primarily due to a decrease in sales to third-party retailers.

_______________

(a)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
         in the average numbers of broadband internet, enhanced video and fixed-line telephony RGUs that was largely offset by a
         decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)      The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to an increase in Switzerland that was only
         partially offset by a decrease in Austria. The increase in Switzerland is attributable to (i) an improvement in RGU mix and
         (ii) a net increase due to (a) higher ARPU from video services, (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (c)
         higher ARPU from broadband internet services. The decrease in Austria is attributable to (1) a net decrease due to (I) lower
         ARPU from fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services and (II) higher ARPU from video services and (2) an
         adverse change in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in B2B revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased volumes in voice, data and broadband internet
         services in Switzerland and (ii) lower revenue from internet and voice services in Austria.

(d)      The decrease in other non-subscription revenue is largely due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in installation revenue in
         each of Switzerland and Austria, (ii) a decrease in revenue from Austria’s non-cable subscriber base and (iii) an increase
         in mobile handset sales, which typically generate relatively low margins, in Switzerland.

     Central and Eastern Europe. The decrease in Central and Eastern Europe’s revenue during 2014, as compared to 2013, includes

_______________

(a)     The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is primarily attributable to
        (i) an increase in the average numbers of enhanced video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs in Poland,
        Romania, Hungary and Slovakia and (ii) an increase in the average number of DTH RGUs that was largely offset by (a) a
        decline in the average number of basic video RGUs in Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia and (b) a decline in the
        average numbers of enhanced video and fixed-line telephony RGUs in the Czech Republic.

(b)     The decrease in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i)
        lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony, (ii) broadband internet services, primarily in Poland, and (iii) an improvement in
        RGU mix.

(c)     The increase in B2B revenue is largely due to higher revenue from voice services in Hungary and Poland.

(d)     The decrease in other non-subscription revenue is due to (i) a decrease in interconnect revenue, largely as a result of lower
        fixed-line telephony termination rates in Poland, and (ii) a net decrease resulting from individually insignificant changes
        in other non-subscription revenue categories.

     Chile. The decrease in Chile’s revenue during 2014, as compared to 2013, includes (i) an organic increase of $43.4 million

_______________

(a)     The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to an increase
        in the average numbers of enhanced video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs that was only partially offset
        by a decline in the average number of basic video RGUs.

(b)     The increase in cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due to (a) higher
        ARPU from broadband internet services, (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (c) higher ARPU from
        video services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)     The increase in mobile subscription revenue is due to (i) an increase in the average number of subscribers, as an increase
        in the average number of postpaid subscribers more than offset the decrease in the average number of prepaid subscribers,
        and (ii) higher ARPU primarily due to a higher proportion of mobile subscribers on postpaid plans, which generate higher
        ARPU than prepaid plans.

(d)     The decrease in non-subscription revenue is primarily due to a decrease in (i) interconnect revenue, primarily associated
        with a January 2014 decline in mobile terminations rates, and (ii) prepaid mobile handset sales, which typically generate
        relatively low margins.

_______________

(a)      The amount presented for 2014 includes the post-acquisition operating expenses of Ziggo from November 12, 2014 through
         December 31, 2014.

(b)      As further described under Results of Operations above, our organic growth rates are impacted by the methodology we use
         to estimate the impact of an acquisition. This impact is more pronounced in the Netherlands, where the acquired company
         (Ziggo) is significantly larger than our legacy operations in the Netherlands.

(c)      The amount presented for 2015 includes the post-acquisition operating expenses of Choice, which was acquired on June
         3, 2015.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     General. Operating expenses include programming and copyright, network operations, mobile access and interconnect,
customer operations, customer care, share-based compensation and other costs related to our operations. We do not include share-
based compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the operating expenses of our reportable segments as share-based
compensation expense is not included in the performance measures of our reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense
is discussed under Discussion and Analysis of Our Consolidated Operating Results below. Programming and copyright costs,
which represent a significant portion of our operating costs, are expected to rise in future periods as a result of (i) higher costs
associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights
that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, (ii) rate increases and (iii) growth in the number of our enhanced video

                                                                                          II-29
subscribers. In addition, we are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and other costs and foreign currency
exchange risk with respect to costs and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies
of our operating segments (non-functional currency expenses). Any cost increases that we are not able to pass on to our subscribers
through rate increases would result in increased pressure on our operating margins. For additional information concerning our
foreign currency exchange risks see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below.

     European Operations Division. The European Operations Division’s operating expenses (exclusive of share-based
compensation expense) decreased $80.0 million or 1.3% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes (i) an increase
of $578.5 million attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of
$41.7 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal
and FX, the European Operations Division’s operating expenses increased $193.3 million or 3.1%. This increase includes the
following factors:

    •    An increase in programming and copyright costs of $195.7 million or 10.0%, primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland
         and, to a lesser extent, Belgium. The increased costs in (i) U.K./Ireland are primarily due to higher costs for certain
         premium and basic content, due in part to a new sports programming contract entered into in August 2015, and (ii) Belgium
         are primarily due to (a) higher costs for certain premium content and (b) growth in the number of enhanced video
         subscribers. The increase in programming and copyright costs also includes a $29.4 million net increase resulting from
         the impact of certain nonrecurring adjustments related to the settlement or reassessment of operational contingencies.
         The nonrecurring adjustments recorded during 2015 resulted in lower costs of $10.4 million, including a $6.5 million
         benefit in the Netherlands that we recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and a $3.9 million benefit in
         Germany that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015. The nonrecurring adjustments recorded during 2014 resulted
         in lower costs of $39.8 million, including (1) a $17.5 million benefit in Belgium and a $7.3 million benefit in Poland that
         we recorded during the first quarter of 2014 and (2) an $11.6 million benefit in U.K./Ireland that we recorded during the
         second quarter of 2014;

    •    An increase in mobile handset costs of $42.1 million, largely due to the net impact of (i) an increase in the proportion of
         higher-value handsets sold in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent, increased mobile handset costs in Belgium, due in part
         to the impact of a Split-contract Program implemented in the U.K. in November 2014 and in Belgium in June 2015, (ii)
         a decrease in costs as a result of continued growth of subscriber identification module or “SIM”-only contracts in U.K./
         Ireland and (iii) a decrease in costs associated with the impact of subscriber promotions involving free or heavily-
         discounted handsets that were offered in Belgium during 2014;

    •    An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $40.6 million or 11.8%, primarily due to (i) higher call center
         costs in the Netherlands and U.K./Ireland and (ii) higher consulting costs in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the
         European Operations Division’s central operations. The higher call center costs in the Netherlands represent third-party
         costs that are primarily related to network and product harmonization activities following the Ziggo Acquisition that,
         together with certain other third-party customer care costs, accounted for an increase of $17.3 million;

    •    A decrease in personnel costs of $40.1 million or 4.4%, due primarily to the net effect of (i) lower incentive compensation
         costs, predominately in U.K./Ireland, (ii) decreased costs in U.K./Ireland due to higher capitalized labor costs associated
         with the U.K. Network Extension, (iii) annual wage increases, largely in U.K./Ireland, and (iv) lower costs related to
         certain employee benefits in the Netherlands;

    •    A decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs of $18.2 million or 1.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased
         costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Belgium, attributable to higher mobile usage and, in the case of Belgium, mobile
         subscriber growth, (ii) a decline resulting from lower rates, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Germany, (iii) lower fixed-line
         telephony call volumes, primarily related to the net impact of declines in U.K./Ireland and the Netherlands and increases
         in Switzerland/Austria, (iv) an increase of $4.4 million in U.K./Ireland related to the settlement of disputes with mobile
         operators over amounts charged for voice traffic during the fourth quarter of 2015 and (v) a decrease of $4.2 million in
         Switzerland/Austria related to the settlement of an operational contingency during the third quarter of 2015;

    •    An increase in information technology-related expenses of $17.8 million or 25.3%, primarily due to higher software and
         other information technology-related service and maintenance costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland; and

    •    A decrease in network-related expenses of $11.1 million or 1.4%. This decrease includes (i) lower outsourced labor costs
         associated with customer-facing activities in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower costs of $8.6 million in U.K./Ireland associated with
         the reassessment of accruals or operational contingencies in 2015, (iii) an increase in third-party costs incurred in the
         Netherlands of $2.8 million related to the harmonization of the Ziggo and Ziggo Services networks following the Ziggo
                                                               II-30
        Acquisition and (iv) a decrease in network maintenance costs, as decreases in U.K./Ireland and Switzerland/Austria were
        largely offset by increases in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The decrease in network expense also includes the
        impact of reductions in local authority charges for certain elements of network infrastructure in the U.K. arising from
        successful appeals during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. As compared to 2014, these reductions in local
        authority charges resulted in an increase in U.K./Ireland’s network-related expenses of $8.6 million. Taking into account
        the impact of the recurring and nonrecurring benefits from lower local authority network infrastructure charges that are
        included in U.K./Ireland’s 2015 network-related expenses and holding the assessed local authority network infrastructure
        rates and all other factors constant, we estimate that our total local authority network infrastructure charges in the U.K.
        for the year ending December 31, 2016 will be approximately $18 million higher than the amount we incurred in 2015.
        No assurance can be given that actual results will not differ from our expectations in this regard.

     LiLAC Group. The LiLAC Group’s operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased $7.1
million or 1.3% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes an increase of $23.4 million attributable to the impact
of the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of this acquisition and FX, the LiLAC Group’s operating expenses increased
$37.4 million or 7.1%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •   An increase in programming and copyright costs of $24.9 million or 10.7%, primarily associated with (i) increases in
        Chile and, to a lesser extent, Puerto Rico, due to growth in the numbers of enhanced video subscribers and, in the case
        of Puerto Rico, increased costs for certain content, and (ii) an increase of $5.6 million arising from foreign currency
        exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Chile’s U.S. dollar denominated programming contracts. During 2015, $60.4
        million or 44.7% of Chile’s programming costs were denominated in U.S. dollars;

    •   A decrease in personnel costs of $8.5 million or 13.8%, largely due to (i) lower incentive compensation costs in Chile
        and (ii) decreased costs related to higher proportions of employees devoted to the development of new billing and customer
        care systems and other capitalizable activities in Chile;

    •   An increase in mobile access and interconnect costs of $6.1 million or 8.1%, primarily attributable to the net effect of (i)
        an increase in Chile related to (a) higher roaming costs due to the impact of increased volumes and (b) higher interconnect
        costs resulting from the net effect of increased call volumes and lower rates, (ii) a decrease of $5.1 million in mobile
        access charges in Chile due to a February 2015 tariff decline that was retroactive to May 2014, including a decrease of
        $2.5 million related to 2014 access charges, and (iii) an increase in Puerto Rico related to additional capacity agreements
        with third-party internet providers;

    •   An increase in network-related expenses of $4.9 million or 10.4%, primarily due to an increase in network maintenance
        costs in Chile;

    •   An increase of $4.1 million due to the impact of favorable nonrecurring adjustments that were recorded in Chile during
        the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the reassessment of certain accrued liabilities; and

    •   An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $3.2 million or 9.5%, primarily due to higher call center costs
        in Chile.

(a)      As further described under Results of Operations above, the organic decrease in our operating expenses during 2014 is
         impacted by the organic decrease in Virgin Media’s operating expenses. Excluding the impact of Virgin Media, the organic
         increase (decrease) in (i) U.K./Ireland’s operating expenses would have been (3.4%), (ii) Liberty Global Group’s operating
         expenses would have been 1.4% and (iii) our total operating expenses excluding share-based compensation expense would
         have been 0.6%.

(b)      The amount presented for 2013 includes the post-acquisition operating expenses of Virgin Media from June 8, 2013 through
         December 31, 2013.

(c)      The amount presented for 2014 includes the post-acquisition operating expenses of Ziggo from November 12, 2014 through
         December 31, 2014.

                                                                                        II-32
     European Operations Division. The European Operations Division’s operating expenses (exclusive of share-based
compensation expense) increased $1,443.3 million or 29.9% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes $1,393.8
million attributable to the impact of the Virgin Media Acquisition, the Ziggo Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the European Operations Division’s operating expenses decreased $73.2 million or
1.5%. This decrease includes the following factors:

    •    A decrease in network-related expenses of $96.4 million or 13.2%, due in part to a retroactive reduction in U.K. local
         authority charges for network infrastructure following a review by the U.K. government that resulted in a benefit of $46.7
         million during 2014. This benefit consists of (i) a $35.3 million nonrecurring benefit related to periods prior to the third
         quarter of 2014, of which $33.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2014, and (ii) benefits of $5.6 million
         and $5.8 million related to the third and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively. The decrease in network-related expenses
         also includes the net effect of (a) decreased network and customer premises equipment maintenance costs, predominantly
         in Switzerland/Austria, U.K./Ireland and the Netherlands, (b) lower outsourced labor costs associated with customer-
         facing activities, primarily in the Netherlands and U.K./Ireland, (c) lower duct and pole rental costs, primarily in Belgium,
         and (d) higher network and customer premises equipment maintenance costs, predominantly in the European Operations
         Division’s central operations;

    •    An increase in programming and copyright costs of $58.3 million or 4.0%, resulting from an increase in programming
         costs associated with (i) growth in digital video services, predominantly in U.K./Ireland and Belgium and, to a lessor
         extent, Switzerland/Austria and Germany and (ii) increased costs for sports rights, predominantly in U.K./Ireland and,
         to a lesser extent, Romania. These increases were partially offset by the $44.7 million net impact of certain nonrecurring
         adjustments related to the settlement or reassessment of operational contingencies. The nonrecurring adjustments recorded
         during 2014 resulted in lower costs of (a) $16.9 million in Belgium and $7.0 million in Poland during the first quarter,
         (b) $10.6 million in U.K./Ireland during the second quarter, (c) an aggregate of $7.3 million in Belgium, Switzerland/
         Austria and the Netherlands during the third quarter and (d) $2.3 million in the Netherlands during the fourth quarter.
         During 2013, the aggregate impact of similar reassessments and settlements, which included increases in Belgium and
         Poland that were largely offset by a decrease in the Netherlands, resulted in a net cost increase of $0.6 million;

    •    An increase in installation and other direct costs of $23.1 million associated with B2B services in U.K./Ireland;

    •    A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of $17.6 million or 5.7%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower
         call center costs, predominantly in Belgium, U.K./Ireland, Switzerland/Austria and the Netherlands, (ii) lower consulting
         costs in Germany and Belgium and (iii) higher call center costs in Germany;

    •    A decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs of $17.0 million or 2.3%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased
         costs in U.K./Ireland and Belgium attributable to mobile subscriber growth, (ii) decreased costs resulting from lower
         rates, primarily in U.K./Ireland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, (iii) lower call volumes, predominantly in U.K./
         Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Germany and the Netherlands, (iv) decreased costs associated with the U.K.’s non-cable
         subscriber base and (v) a $2.6 million decrease in Belgium due to the impact of an accrual release in the first quarter of
         2014 associated with the reassessment of an operational contingency;

    •    A decrease in mobile handset costs of $15.8 million, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in mobile handset
         costs as a result of continued growth of SIM-only contracts, predominantly in U.K./Ireland, (ii) an increase in costs
         associated with subscriber promotions involving free or heavily-discounted handsets in Belgium and (iii) a net increase
         in mobile handset sales to third-party retailers, as increases in Switzerland/Austria and U.K./Ireland were only partially
         offset by a decrease in Belgium;

    •    A decrease in personnel costs of $15.4 million or 2.1%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) decreased staffing levels,
         primarily as a result of integration and reorganization activities in the U.K. following the Virgin Media Acquisition, (ii)
         annual wage increases, primarily in U.K./Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and (iii) higher incentive
         compensation costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland. Additionally, changes in the proportion of capitalizable activities during
         2014 resulted in a net decrease in personnel costs, primarily due to the net effect of (a) lower costs in Germany and (b)
         higher costs in U.K./Ireland;

    •    A decrease in certain direct costs of $14.2 million associated with the U.K.’s non-cable subscriber base;

    •    A decrease in bad debt and collection expenses of $12.6 million or 9.8%, with most of the declines occurring in Germany,
         the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Hungary; and

                                                                II-33
    •       A net increase resulting from individually insignificant changes in other operating expense categories.

     LiLAC Group. The LiLAC Group’s operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased $81.9
million or 13.4% during 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the effects of FX, the LiLAC Group’s operating expenses decreased
$22.4 million or 3.7%. This decrease includes the following factors:

        •    An increase in programming and copyright costs of $17.3 million or 7.2%, primarily associated with (i) growth in Chile’s
             digital cable services and (ii) a $5.2 million increase arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with
             respect to Chile’s U.S. dollar denominated programming contracts. During 2014, $39.9 million or 27.6% of Chile’s
             programming costs were denominated in U.S. dollars;

        •    A decrease in facilities expenses of $11.6 million or 68.9%, primarily due to lower tower and real estate rental costs in
             Chile, as the fair value of all remaining payments due under these leases was included in the restructuring charges
             recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2013 in connection with certain strategic changes that were implemented
             with regard to Chile’s mobile operations, as further described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements;

        •    A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of $5.6 million or 10.4%, primarily attributable to the net effect of
             (i) lower costs associated with the network operating center related to Chile’s mobile operations, (ii) higher call center
             costs in Chile and (iii) the favorable impact of a $3.1 million nonrecurring charge recorded during the second quarter
             of 2013 to provide for Chile’s mandated share of severance and other labor-related obligations that were incurred by a
             VTR contractor in connection with such contractor’s bankruptcy;

        •    A decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs of $5.4 million, primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower mobile
             access charges due to the impacts of lower contractual rates in Chile, (ii) an increase in interconnect costs in Chile
             resulting from the net effect of (a) higher call volumes and (b) lower rates; and (iii) lower access costs in Puerto Rico
             due to the migration of certain fixed-line telephony customers from a third-party network to Puerto Rico’s network;

        •    A decrease in mobile handset costs of $5.1 million or 23.0% in Chile, primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of $4.2
             million related to the impact of the liquidation or write-off of slow moving or obsolete mobile handsets and wireless
             network adaptors in 2013 and (ii) a decrease in mobile handset sales due to a reduced emphasis on prepaid plans;

        •    A decrease of $4.7 million in Chile due to the favorable impact of nonrecurring adjustments during the fourth quarter
             of 2014 related to the reassessment of certain accrued liabilities;

        •    A decrease in network-related expenses of $3.5 million or 6.6% primarily due to the net effect of (i) a higher proportion
             of capitalizable activities during 2014 in Puerto Rico resulting from increased activity related to network upgrades and
             improvements, (ii) lower pole rental costs in Chile, (iii) higher network and customer premises equipment maintenance
             costs in Chile and (iv) higher outsourced labor costs associated with customer-facing activities in Puerto Rico; and

        •    A decrease in bad debt and collection expenses of $3.2 million or 6.2%, largely in Chile. The decrease in Chile is primarily
             due to more selective credit acceptance policies.

     General. SG&A expenses include human resources, information technology, general services, management, finance, legal
and sales and marketing costs, share-based compensation and other general expenses. We do not include share-based compensation
in the following discussion and analysis of the SG&A expenses of our reportable segments as share-based compensation expense
is not included in the performance measures of our reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed under
Discussion and Analysis of Our Consolidated Operating Results below. As noted under Operating Expenses of our Reportable
Segments above, we are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and other costs and foreign currency exchange
                                                                                          II-35

     European Operations Division. The European Operations Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation
expense) decreased $19.3 million or 0.8% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes $286.7 million attributable
to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, the
European Operations Division’s SG&A expenses increased $43.9 million or 1.8%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •    An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $33.7 million or 20.5%, primarily due to the net effect of (i)
         increased consulting costs associated with (a) scale initiatives in the areas of information technology and finance in the
         European Operations Division’s central operations and (b) strategic initiatives in U.K./Ireland, (ii) the positive impact of
         a $7.8 million increase associated with the nonrecurring consulting fee that was incurred during the third quarter of 2014
         in connection with the reduction in local authority charges for certain elements of network infrastructure in the U.K., as
         discussed under Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments above, (iii) increased consulting costs related to
         integration activities in (1) Belgium of $9.0 million and (2) the Netherlands and the European Operations Division’s
         central operations of $1.6 million, (iv) decreased consulting costs related to strategic initiatives in Germany, (v) decreased
         legal costs in U.K./Ireland and (vi) an increase of $2.7 million in U.K./Ireland associated with the nonrecurring consulting
         fee that was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection with the settlement of disputes with mobile operators
         over amounts charged for voice traffic;

    •    An increase in information technology-related expenses of $13.7 million or 11.8%, primarily due to higher software and
         other information technology-related maintenance costs, primarily in the European Operations Division’s central
         operations and U.K./Ireland;

    •    A decrease of $10.4 million due to an accrual release recorded during the second quarter of 2015 related to the resolution
         of a contingency associated with universal service obligations in Belgium;

    •    An increase in sales and marketing costs of $6.0 million or 0.7%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher third-party
         sales commissions, primarily related to the net impact of an increase in Germany that was only partially offset by a decline
         in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower costs associated with advertising campaigns, primarily related to decreases in the Netherlands
         and Germany that were only partially offset by increases in Belgium and U.K./Ireland, (iii) a decrease of $4.7 million in
         Germany due to the impact of an accrual release in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 associated with the reassessment
         of an operational contingency and (iv) a $3.8 million increase in third-party costs in the Netherlands and the European
         Operations Division’s central operations related to rebranding activities following the Ziggo Acquisition; and

    •    A decrease in personnel costs of $5.7 million or 0.6%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased staffing levels,
         primarily in the European Operations Division’s central operations, Belgium, Germany and U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower
         incentive compensation costs, primarily related to decreases in U.K./Ireland and the Netherlands that were only partially
         offset by an increase in Belgium, (iii) annual wage increases, largely in U.K./Ireland, (iv) decreased costs in U.K./Ireland
         due to higher capitalized labor costs associated with the U.K. Network Extension, (v) lower costs related to certain
         employee benefits in the Netherlands, (vi) a $3.2 million increase in the European Operations Division’s central operations
         due to the impact of an accrual release recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with the settlement of an operational
         contingency and (vii) higher temporary personnel costs in the Netherlands of $2.0 million related to integration activities
         in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition.

     LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased $9.8
million or 5.0%, during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decreases includes an increase of $7.8 million attributable to the impact
of the Choice Acquisition. Excluding the effects of this acquisition and FX, the LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses increased $3.4
million or 1.7%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •    An increase in sales and marketing costs of $3.7 million or 6.3%, primarily due to higher third-party sales commissions
         in Chile;

    •    A decrease of $2.2 million, due to lower costs associated with the national gross receipts tax that was implemented in
         Puerto Rico in July 2014. In 2015, it was determined that the tax would not be continued beyond 2014;

    •    A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of $1.9 million or 14.7%, primarily due to lower fees associated
         with legal proceedings in Puerto Rico;

                                                                 II-36
      •     An increase of $1.6 million due to the impact of favorable nonrecurring adjustments that were recorded in Chile during
            the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the reassessment of certain accrued liabilities; and

      •     An increase in personnel costs of $0.1 million or 0.2%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in Chile due to
            lower incentive compensation and severance costs and (ii) annual wage increases.

(a)       As further described under Results of Operations above, the organic increase in our SG&A expenses during 2014 is impacted
          by the organic increase in Virgin Media’s SG&A expenses. Excluding the impact of Virgin Media, the organic increase in
          (i) U.K./Ireland’s SG&A expenses would have been 2.4%, (ii) Liberty Global Group’s SG&A expenses would have been
          7.5% and (iii) our total SG&A expenses excluding share-based compensation expense would have been 6.5%.

(b)       The amount presented for 2013 includes the post-acquisition SG&A expenses of Virgin Media from June 8, 2013 through
          December 31, 2013.

(c)       The amount presented for 2014 includes the post-acquisition SG&A expenses of Ziggo from November 12, 2014 through
          December 31, 2014.

     European Operations Division. The European Operations Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation
expense) increased $563.5 million or 29.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes $412.2 million attributable
to the impact of the Virgin Media Acquisition, the Ziggo Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions. Excluding the effects
of acquisitions and FX, the European Operations Division’s SG&A expenses increased $120.5 million or 6.3%. This increase
includes the following factors:

    •    An increase in information technology-related expenses of $41.4 million or 51.2%, largely due to higher software and
         other information technology-related maintenance costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the European Operations Division’s
         central operations, Germany and Belgium;

    •    An increase in sales and marketing costs of $35.4 million or 5.3%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher costs
         associated with advertising campaigns, predominantly in U.K./Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland/
         Austria, and (ii) a decrease in third-party sales commissions, primarily attributable to the net impact of (a) decreases in
         U.K./Ireland and Switzerland/Austria and (b) an increase in Germany;

    •    An increase in personnel costs of $32.3 million or 4.2%, due to the net effect of (i) higher incentive compensation costs
         predominantly in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent, the European Operations Division’s central operations and the
         Netherlands, (ii) decreased staffing levels in the U.K. as a result of integration and reorganization activities following
         the Virgin Media Acquisition, (iii) increased staffing levels in the European Operations Division’s central operations,
         Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland/Austria, (iv) annual wage increases, mostly in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands,
         Germany, the European Operations Division’s central operations and Belgium, and (v) a $3.5 million decrease in the
         European Operations Division’s central operations due to the impact of an accrual release in the fourth quarter of 2014
         associated with the settlement of an operational contingency; and

    •    An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of $22.0 million or 16.1%, primarily due to (i) increased consulting
         costs associated with scale initiatives in the areas of information technology and finance, primarily in the European
         Operations Division’s central operations, Switzerland/Austria and Germany, and (ii) a $7.3 million increase associated
         with a nonrecurring consulting fee incurred during the third quarter of 2014 in connection with the retroactive reduction
         in U.K. local authority charges, as discussed under Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments above.

     LiLAC Division. The LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased $21.3
million or 9.8%, during 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the effects of FX, the LiLAC Division’s SG&A expenses increased
$2.1 million or 1.0%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •    An increase in sales and marketing costs of $12.8 million or 22.9%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher third-
         party sales commissions and advertising costs related to Chile’s cable operations and (ii) lower third-party sales
         commissions related to Chile’s mobile operations;

    •    A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of $6.2 million or 30.5%, primarily due to lower fees associated
         with legal proceedings in Puerto Rico;

    •    A decrease of $1.9 million due to the favorable impact of nonrecurring adjustments in Chile during the fourth quarter of
         2014 related to the reassessment of certain accrued liabilities;

    •    A decrease in personnel costs of $1.5 million or 2.1%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease due to lower staffing
         levels in Chile, (ii) an increase due to higher incentive compensation costs in Chile, (iii) an increase due to higher severance
         costs and (iv) an increase due to higher staffing levels in Puerto Rico; and

    •    A net decrease resulting from individually insignificant changes in various other SG&A expense categories.

(a)     As further described under Results of Operations above, the organic increase in our Adjusted OIBDA during 2015 is impacted
        by the organic increase in Virgin Media’s Adjusted OIBDA. Excluding the impact of Virgin Media, the organic increase in
        (i) U.K./Ireland’s Adjusted OIBDA would have been 4.6%, (ii) Liberty Global Group’s Adjusted OIBDA would have been
        2.7% and (iii) our total Adjusted OIBDA would have been 3.8%.

(b)     The amount presented for 2013 includes the post-acquisition Adjusted OIBDA of Virgin Media from June 8, 2013 through
        December 31, 2014.

    In addition to organic changes in the revenue, operating expenses and SG&A expenses of our reportable segments, the Adjusted
OIBDA margins presented above include the impact of acquisitions, the most significant of which are the Choice Acquisition, the
Ziggo Acquisition and the Virgin Media Acquisition. In this regard, (i) the Adjusted OIBDA margins of the Netherlands and Puerto
Rico during 2015 were adversely impacted by the inclusion of Ziggo and Choice, respectively, each of which generated relatively
lower Adjusted OIBDA margins than the respective legacy operations and (ii) the Adjusted OIBDA margin of the European
Operations Division during 2014 was negatively impacted by the full-year inclusion of the relatively lower Adjusted OIBDA
margin of Virgin Media. For discussion of the factors contributing to other changes in the Adjusted OIBDA margins of our reportable
segments, see the above analyses of the revenue, operating expenses and SG&A expenses of our reportable segments.

_______________

(a)     Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
        fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(b)     Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $212.7 million and $245.0 million during 2015 and
        2014, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue.

(c)     B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium
        to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain SOHO subscribers.
        SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-
        line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
        subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in cable subscription revenue, aggregated $321.8 million
        and $220.7 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. On an organic basis, our total B2B revenue, including revenue from
        SOHO subscribers, increased 11.4% during 2015, as compared to 2014. A portion of the increase in our SOHO revenue is
        attributable to the conversion of our residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers.

(d)     Other revenue includes, among other items, interconnect, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fee and installation revenue.

     Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $31.7 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes
(i) an increase of $1,866.2 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $50.0 million attributable to the
U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and another less significant disposition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our
consolidated revenue increased $658.5 million or 3.6%.



                                                                                  II-42
     Subscription revenue. The details of the change in our consolidated subscription revenue for 2015, as compared to 2014, are
as follows (in millions):

Increase in cable subscription revenue due to change in:
   Average number of RGUs.................................................................................................................................... $                      236.3
   ARPU...................................................................................................................................................................           209.6
     Total increase in cable subscription revenue ....................................................................................................                               445.9
Increase in mobile revenue .......................................................................................................................................                    39.5
     Total increase in subscription revenue..............................................................................................................                            485.4
Impact of acquisitions...............................................................................................................................................              1,701.2
Impact of FX.............................................................................................................................................................         (2,125.9)
     Total .................................................................................................................................................................. $      60.7

     Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased $445.9 million or 3.1%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase in subscription revenue is attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase from
broadband internet services of $443.0 million or 9.4%, attributable to an increase in the average number of broadband internet
RGUs and higher ARPU from broadband internet services, (ii) an increase from video services of $28.3 million or 0.4%, attributable
to the net effect of (a) higher ARPU from video services and (b) a decline in the average number of video RGUs, and (iii) a decrease
from fixed-line telephony services of $25.4 million or 0.8%, attributable to the net effect of (1) lower ARPU from fixed-line
telephony services and (2) an increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs.

    Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated mobile subscription revenue increased $39.5 million or 3.6%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in Belgium, Chile, Switzerland
and the Netherlands and (ii) a decline in the U.K.

    B2B revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated B2B revenue increased $95.9 million or 6.4%
during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in the U.K., Belgium, Switzerland,
Germany and Poland and (ii) a decrease in the Netherlands.

     Other revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and FX, our consolidated other revenue increased $77.2
million or 6.7% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in
mobile handset sales, primarily associated with the introduction of Split-contract Programs in the U.K. and Belgium, (ii) a decrease
in fixed-line interconnect revenue, primarily in Chile, Germany and the U.K., (iii) a decrease in installation revenue, primarily in
the U.K. and the Netherlands, and (iv) a decrease in set-top box sales, primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands.

  Operating expenses

     Our operating expenses decreased $81.9 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease includes (i) an increase of
$601.9 million attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions
and (ii) a decrease of $55.4 million attributable to the U.K. Non-Cable Disposal and another less significant disposition. Our
operating expenses include share-based compensation expense, which decreased $4.2 million during 2015. For additional
information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions,
FX and share-based compensation expense, our operating expenses increased $244.2 million or 3.6% during 2015, as compared
to 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) an increase in programming and copyright costs, (b) a decrease
in personnel costs, (c) an increase in outsourced labor and professional fees, (d) an increase in mobile handset costs, (e) an increase
in information technology-related costs, (f) a decrease in interconnect costs and (g) a decrease in network-related expenses. Certain
of these changes include the impact of a $20.1 million increase in integration-related costs in the Netherlands. For additional
information regarding the changes in our operating expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Operating
Expenses of our Reportable Segments above.

  SG&A expenses

     Our SG&A expenses increased $29.6 million during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase includes $294.5 million
attributable to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, the Choice Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions. Our SG&A
expenses include share-based compensation expense, which increased $65.2 million during 2015. For additional information, see
the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based
compensation expense, our SG&A expenses increased $53.3 million or 1.8% during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase is
primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in outsourced labor and professional fees, including an increase in corporate costs
of $19.9 million associated with the Liberty 3.0 initiative, (ii) an increase in information technology-related expenses, (iii) an
increase in sales and marketing costs and (iv) a decrease in personnel costs. Certain of these changes include the impact of a $9.6
million increase in integration-related costs, primarily in the Netherlands and Belgium. For additional information regarding the
changes in our SG&A expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — SG&A Expenses of our Reportable
Segments above.

  Share-based compensation expense (included in operating and SG&A expenses)

     Our share-based compensation expense is based on the share-based incentive awards held by our and our subsidiaries’
employees, including awards issued by Liberty Global. A summary of our aggregate share-based compensation expense is set
forth below:
                                                                                                                                                            Year ended December 31,

_______________

(a)      Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i) Liberty Global PSUs, (ii) the Challenge Performance Awards and
         (iii) the PGUs.

(b)      In connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition, we issued Virgin Media Replacement Awards to employees and former
         directors of Virgin Media in exchange for corresponding Virgin Media awards. Virgin Media recorded share-based
         compensation expense of $54.1 million and $55.8 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively, including compensation
         expense related to the Virgin Media Replacement Awards and new awards that were granted after the Virgin Media
         Replacement Awards were issued.

(c)      In connection with the LiLAC Transaction, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the Award
         Modifications in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive plans. The objective of the compensation committee
         was to ensure a relatively unchanged intrinsic value of outstanding equity awards before and after the bonus issuance of
         the LiLAC Shares. The mechanism to modify outstanding share-based incentive awards, as approved by the compensation
         committee, utilized the Modification VWAPs. In order to determine if any incremental stock-based compensation expense
         should be recorded as a result of the Award Modifications, we are required to measure the changes in the fair values of the
         then outstanding share-based incentive awards using market prices immediately before and immediately after the Award
         Modifications. Due to declines in the share prices of our Class A and Class C Liberty Global Shares following the bonus
         issuance, the exercise prices of options, SARs and PSARs determined using the Modification VWAPs were lower than the
         exercise prices that would have resulted if the market prices immediately before and after the Award Modifications had
         been used. Accordingly, the Black-Scholes fair values of our options, SARs and PSARs increased as a result of the Award
         Modifications, resulting in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $99.3 million. This amount includes $69.3
         million of expense recognized during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 related to awards that vested on or prior to
         December 31, 2015 and $30.0 million of expense that will be recognized in future periods through 2019 as the related
         awards vest.

(d)      Represents the share-based compensation expense associated with Telenet’s share-based incentive awards, which, at
         December 31, 2015, included (i) warrants and employee stock options (1,813,815 awards outstanding at a weighted average
                                                              II-46
         exercise price of €42.17 ($45.82)), (ii) performance-based specific stock option plans for the Chief Executive Officer
         (745,000 awards outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of €40.60 ($44.12)), (iii) performance-based share award
         (82,747 awards outstanding) and (iv) an employee share purchase plan.

(e)      The amount for 2015 includes the reversal of $1.8 million of share-based compensation expense, primarily related to
         forfeitures of unvested PSUs during the first quarter of 2015.

      For additional information concerning our share-based compensation, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Depreciation and amortization expense

      The details of our depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:

     Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense increased $1,117.8 million or 20.3% during 2015, as
compared to 2014. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition. In addition, a net increase resulted from
(i) an increase associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the
expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives and (ii) a decrease associated with certain assets becoming
fully depreciated, primarily in U.K./Ireland and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Chile and Switzerland/
Austria.

  Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net

      The details of our impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, are as follows:

   Total............................................................................................................................................... $        174.1      $    536.8

      The total for 2015 includes (i) restructuring charges of $103.8 million, including (a) $102.3 million of employee severance
and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in the Netherlands, U.K./Ireland, Germany, Switzerland/
Austria and Puerto Rico, (b) contract termination charges of $19.3 million, primarily in Belgium, Chile and Puerto Rico, and (c)
a credit of $17.0 million recorded by Telenet during the fourth quarter following the settlement of its DTT capacity contract
obligations, the fair value of which were originally recorded during 2014 when Telenet discontinued the provision of DTT services,
(ii) direct acquisition costs of $49.8 million, primarily related to our pending acquisition of CWC, Telenet’s acquisition of BASE,
our acquisition of additional shares of ITV, the Choice Acquisition and the Ziggo Acquisition, (iii) impairment charges of $24.8
million, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland/Austria, and (iv) a $23.1 million loss on the divestiture of our
Film1 channels.

     We expect to record significant restructuring charges during 2016, due largely to our ongoing company-wide effort to optimize
our operating model pursuant to Liberty 3.0. In addition, we expect to undertake restructuring programs in certain of our operating
segments, including programs to be undertaken in connection with the integration of acquired entities.

     The total for 2014 includes (i) direct acquisition costs of $331.3 million, including (a) $222.0 million that was accrued during
the fourth quarter in connection with the settlement of certain third-party appeals of the German competition authority’s 2011

was recorded by Ziggo during the fourth quarter of 2014 to reduce the carrying amount of certain of Ziggo’s internal-use software
assets to zero following our determination that these assets would have no future service potential for our combined operations
in the Netherlands.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     Excluding the effects of FX, interest expense increased $228.5 million or 9.0%. This increase is primarily attributable to the
net effect of (i) higher average outstanding debt balances, largely due to debt incurred in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition,
and (ii) lower weighted average interest rates related to the completion of certain financing transactions that resulted in extended
maturities and net decreases to certain of our interest rates. For additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness,
see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

     It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing
indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note 10 to our
consolidated financial statements and under Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk below, we use derivative
instruments to manage our interest rate risks. As we do not apply hedge accounting to our interest rate derivative instruments, the
impacts of these derivative instruments are not included in interest expense.

reduction in net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to enacted changes in tax law and (iii) certain permanent differences between
the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. The net negative
impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) the tax effect of intercompany financing and (b) statutory
tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate.

     The income tax benefit during 2014 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $221.7 million (based on the U.K. statutory
income tax rate of 21.0%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) certain permanent
differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items and (iii) certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries. The net negative impact
of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate
that are different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate, (b) the tax effect of intercompany financing, (c) non-deductible or non-
taxable foreign currency exchange results and (d) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.

  Loss from continuing operations

     The details of our losses from continuing operations are as follows:

                                                                                                                                                            Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                                                                              2015             2014

Liberty Global Group......................................................................................................................... $               (1,101.2) $     (990.6)
LiLAC Group.....................................................................................................................................                  51.7           9.7
   Total............................................................................................................................................... $     (1,049.5) $     (980.9)

     During 2015 and 2014, we reported losses from continuing operations of $1,049.5 million and $980.9 million, respectively,
including (i) operating income of $2,349.2 million and $2,228.2 million, respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of $3,033.8
million and $3,284.1 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax benefit (expense) of ($364.9 million) and $75.0 million, respectively.

    Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in foreign currency
exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such,
any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from
these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings from continuing operations is largely dependent
on our ability to increase our aggregate Adjusted OIBDA to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) share-
based compensation expense, (b) depreciation and amortization, (c) impairment, restructuring and other operating items, (d) interest
expense, (e) other non-operating expenses and (f) income tax expenses.

    Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization below, we expect that we will continue to report significant levels of interest
expense for the foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect certain
                                                               II-52
aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under Overview above. For information concerning the reasons
for changes in specific line items in our consolidated statements of operations, see the discussion under Discussion and Analysis
of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results above.

  Discontinued operation

     Our earnings from discontinued operation, net of taxes, of $0.8 million during 2014 relate to the operations of the Chellomedia
Disposal Group. In addition, we recognized an after-tax gain on the disposal of a discontinued operation of $332.7 million related
to the January 31, 2014 completion of the Chellomedia Transaction. For additional information, see note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements.

  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

      The details of our net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest are as follows:

                                                                                                                                       Year ended December 31,

   Total ......................................................................................................................... $       (103.0) $        (47.6) $        (55.4)

     Net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the noncontrolling interests’ share of the results of our
continuing and discontinued operations. The change in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during 2015, as compared
to 2014, is primarily attributable to the results of operations of Telenet.

_________________

(a)      Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
         fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
         proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
         pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
         categories from period to period.
                                                                  II-53
(b)      Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $245.0 million and $175.2 million during 2014 and
         2013, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue.

(c)      B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium
         to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain SOHO subscribers.
         SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-
         line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
         subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in cable subscription revenue, aggregated $220.7 million
         and $158.9 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. On an organic basis, our total B2B revenue, including revenue from
         SOHO subscribers, increased 10.0% during 2014, as compared to 2013. A portion of the increase in our SOHO revenue is
         attributable to the conversion of our residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers.

(d)      Other revenue includes, among other items, interconnect, installation and channel carriage fee revenue.

(e)      As further described under Results of Operations above, our organic revenue growth rates for 2014, as compared to 2013,
         are impacted by the organic growth of Virgin Media. Excluding the impacts of the organic growth of Virgin Media, our
         organic growth rates (%) for such period would have been as follows:

     Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $3,774.1 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes
$3,096.0 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated revenue
increased $523.9 million or 3.6%.

     Subscription revenue. The details of the change in our consolidated subscription revenue for 2014, as compared to 2013, are
as follows (in millions):

Increase in cable subscription revenue due to change in:
   Average number of RGUs.................................................................................................................................... $                     347.9

Impact of FX.............................................................................................................................................................           129.1
     Total .................................................................................................................................................................. $   3,169.8

     Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased $503.3 million or 4.3%
during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase in subscription revenue is attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase from
broadband internet services of $478.6 million or 13.5%, attributable to an increase in the average number of broadband internet
RGUs and higher ARPU from broadband internet services, (ii) an increase from video services of $34.9 million or 0.6%, attributable
to the net effect of (a) higher ARPU from video services and (b) a decline in the average number of video RGUs, and (iii) a decrease
from fixed-line telephony services of $10.2 million or 0.4%, attributable to the net effect of (1) lower ARPU from fixed-line
telephony services and (2) an increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs.


                                                                                             II-54
    Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated mobile subscription revenue increased $73.0 million or 10.9%
during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase is primarily due to increases in the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, Belgium, Chile
and Germany.

    B2B revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated B2B revenue increased $68.7 million or 7.0%
during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase is primarily due to increases in the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland and
Belgium.

      Other revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated other revenue decreased $121.1 million or
11.4% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This decrease is primarily attributable to declines in (i) fixed-line interconnect revenue,
(ii) Virgin Media’s non-cable subscriber base and (iii) installation revenue.

_______________

(a)     Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $2.8 million and $6.1 million during 2014 and 2013,
        respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue.

(b)     Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in cable subscription revenue, aggregated $17.3 million and $5.8
        million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. On an organic basis, the LiLAC Group’s total B2B revenue, including revenue
        from SOHO subscribers, increased 157.3% during 2014, as compared to 2013.

  Operating expenses

     Our operating expenses increased $1,411.1 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes $1,393.8 million
attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Our operating expenses include share-based compensation expense, which decreased
$4.5 million during 2014. For additional information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based compensation expense, our operating expenses decreased $46.4 million
or 0.9% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This decrease is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in network-
related expenses, (ii) an increase in programming and copyright costs, (iii) a decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees,
(iv) an increase in installation and other direct costs associated with B2B services in the U.K., (v) a decrease in mobile handset
costs, (vi) a decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs, (vii) a decrease in bad debt and collections expenses, (viii) a decrease
in certain direct costs associated with the U.K.’s non-cable subscriber base and (ix) a decrease in personnel costs. For additional
information regarding the changes in our operating expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Operating
Expenses of our Reportable Segments above.

  SG&A expenses

      Our SG&A expenses increased $537.9 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes $412.2 million
attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Our SG&A expenses include share-based compensation expense, which decreased $39.0
million during 2014. For additional information, see the discussion under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding
the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based compensation expense, our SG&A expenses increased $157.5 million or 6.8%
during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase is primarily due to increases in (i) personnel costs, (ii) sales and marketing costs,
(iii) information technology-related expenses and (iv) outsourced labor and professional fees, as increases in consulting costs
associated with scale initiatives in the areas of information technology and finance were only partially offset by a decrease in
integration costs. For additional information regarding the changes in our SG&A expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our
Reportable Segments — SG&A Expenses of our Reportable Segments above.

(a)      Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i) Liberty Global PSUs, (ii) the Challenge Performance Awards,
         which were issued on June 24, 2013, and (iii) for 2014, the PGUs.

(b)      In connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition, we issued Virgin Media Replacement Awards to employees and former
         directors of Virgin Media in exchange for corresponding Virgin Media awards. Virgin Media recorded share-based
         compensation expense of $55.8 million during 2014, including compensation expense related to the Virgin Media
         Replacement Awards and new awards that were granted after the Virgin Media Replacement Awards were issued. During
         2013, Virgin Media recorded share-based compensation expense of $134.3 million, primarily related to the Virgin Media
         Replacement Awards, including $80.1 million that was charged to expense in recognition of the Virgin Media Replacement
         Awards that were fully vested on June 7, 2013 or for which vesting was accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Virgin
         Media Merger Agreement on or prior to December 31, 2013.

(c)      During 2013, Telenet modified the terms of certain of its share-based incentive plans to provide for anti-dilution adjustments
         in connection with its shareholder returns. In connection with these anti-dilution adjustments, Telenet recognized share-
         based compensation expense of $32.7 million and continues to recognize additional share-based compensation expense as
         the underlying options vest. In addition, during 2013, Telenet recognized expense of $6.2 million related to the accelerated
         vesting of certain options.

     Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense increased $1,131.5 million or 26.5%. This increase is
primarily due to the impact of the Virgin Media Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the Ziggo Acquisition. In addition, a net increase
resulted from the following factors: (i) an increase associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of
customer premises equipment, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives, (ii) a decrease associated
with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, primarily in the U.K., Belgium, Chile and Switzerland, and (iii) a decrease due to
the impact of accelerated depreciation recorded during 2013, primarily in Chile where the acceleration was due to a change in our
mobile strategy, as further discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Release of litigation provision

     During 2007, we recorded a litigation provision of $146.0 million based on our assessment at the time of our loss exposure
with respect to notices we received during 2002 and 2006 from former shareholders of Cignal Global Communications. On October
25, 2013, we received what we consider to be the effective resolution of these notices and, accordingly, we released the entire
$146.0 million provision during the third quarter of 2013.

     The total for 2014 includes (i) direct acquisition costs of $331.3 million, including (a) $222.0 million that was accrued during
the fourth quarter in connection with the settlement of certain third-party appeals of the German competition authority’s 2011
decision to approve our acquisition of KBW and (b) $84.1 million associated with the Ziggo Acquisition, (ii) restructuring charges
of $166.9 million, including (1) an $86.1 million charge to record the fair value of Telenet’s obligations under certain DTT capacity
contracts following Telenet’s decision to discontinue the provision of DTT services on March 31, 2014 and (2) $60.4 million of
employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands,
Germany, Chile and the European Operations Division’s central operations, and (iii) an impairment charge of $68.7 million that
was recorded by Ziggo during the fourth quarter of 2014 to reduce the carrying amount of certain of Ziggo’s internal-use software
assets to zero following our determination that these assets would have no future service potential for our combined operations
in the Netherlands.

     The total for 2013 includes (i) restructuring charges of $178.7 million, (ii) direct acquisition and disposition costs of $64.7
million, primarily related to the Virgin Media Acquisition, (iii) an impairment charge of $73.0 million to reduce the carrying
amount of Telenet’s spectrum rights following Telenet’s determination that it would no longer be able to utilize its spectrum rights
as a result of the conclusion of negotiations with network operators in Belgium and the absence of regulatory alternatives and (iv)
a $20.0 million credit resulting from cash received from the seller of OneLink upon the settlement of certain claims related to the
OneLink Acquisition. The restructuring charges include (a) $84.9 million recorded by VTR during the third and fourth quarters
                                                               II-58
of 2013 as a result of the decision to cease commercial use of VTR’s mobile network, as further described in note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements, and (b) $77.9 million of employee severance and termination costs related to certain
reorganization and integration activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland, Germany and Chile. The restructuring charges recorded by
VTR include the fair value of (1) the remaining payments due under certain tower and real estate operating leases of $71.5 million
and (2) certain other required payments associated with VTR’s mobile network.

_______________

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     Excluding the effects of FX, interest expense increased $538.2 million or 23.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to the
net impact of (i) a higher average outstanding debt balance, largely due to (a) debt that was incurred in the first and second quarters
of 2013 in connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition and (b) debt that was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection
with the Ziggo Acquisition, and (ii) a lower weighted average interest rate. The decrease in our weighted average interest rate is
primarily related to (1) the completion of certain financing transactions that resulted in extended maturities and net decreases to
certain of our interest rates and (2) decreases in certain of the base rates for our variable-rate indebtedness. For additional information
regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     This decrease is primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in dividend income related to our investment in shares of Ziggo, as
Ziggo did not declare any dividends following the January 2014 execution of the Ziggo Merger Protocol, and (ii) a slight decrease
in interest income due to a lower average cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance.

(a)      The gain during 2014 is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) gains associated with decreases in the values of the
         euro, British pound sterling, Chilean peso and Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar, (ii) losses associated with decreases
         in market interest rates in the euro, British pound sterling, Swiss franc and Chilean peso markets and (iii) gains associated
         with decreases in the values of the Hungarian forint and Polish zloty relative to the euro. In addition, the gain during 2014
         includes a net loss of $120.9 million resulting from changes in our credit risk valuation adjustments. The loss during 2013

   Total............................................................................................................................................... $         75.0   $    (355.5)

     The income tax benefit during 2014 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $221.7 million (based on the U.K. statutory
income tax rate of 21.0%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) certain permanent
differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items and (iii) certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries. The net negative impact
of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate
that are different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate, (b) the tax effect of intercompany financing, (c) non-deductible or non-
taxable foreign currency exchange results and (d) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.

     The income tax expense during 2013 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $121.1 million (based on the U.K.
statutory income tax rate of 23.0%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) a reduction in net deferred tax assets in the U.K.
due to enacted changes in tax law, (ii) a loss of subsidiary tax attributes due to a deemed change in control related to the Virgin
Media Acquisition, (iii) an increase in valuation allowances, (iv) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results
and (v) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items, including
$51.1 million related to the reversal of a litigation provision in the third quarter, as further described in note 17 to our consolidated
financial statements. The net negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) statutory tax rates

                                                                                            II-62

     During 2014 and 2013, we reported losses from continuing operations of $980.9 million and $882.0 million, respectively,
including (i) operating income of $2,228.2 million and $2,012.1 million, respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of $3,284.1
million and $2,538.6 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax benefit (expense) of $75.0 million and ($355.5 million), respectively.

  Discontinued operation

    Our earnings (loss) from discontinued operation, net of taxes, of $0.8 million and ($23.7 million) during 2014 and 2013,
respectively, relates to the operations of the Chellomedia Disposal Group. In addition, we recognized an after-tax gain on the
disposal of a discontinued operation of $332.7 million related to the January 31, 2014 completion of the Chellomedia Transaction.

  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

     The details of our net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest are as follows:

     The change in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily attributable
to the net effect of (i) a decline in the results of operations of Telenet and (ii) the impact of the VTR NCI Acquisition, which was
completed during the first quarter of 2014.




                                                                                            II-63
Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Sources and Uses of Cash

     We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements
at the corporate level. Although our consolidated operating subsidiaries generate cash from operating activities, each of our
significant operating subsidiaries is included within one of our seven subsidiary “borrowing groups.” These borrowing groups
include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia, UPC
Holding, Telenet, VTR Finance and Liberty Puerto Rico. As set forth in the table below, our borrowing groups accounted for a
significant portion of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015. The terms of the instruments governing
the indebtedness of these borrowing groups restrict our ability to access the liquidity of these subsidiaries. In addition, our ability
to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling
interests and other factors.

  Cash and cash equivalents

     The details of the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 are
set forth in the following table (in millions):

(e)    Except as otherwise noted, represents the aggregate amounts held by the parent entity and restricted subsidiaries of our

  Liquidity of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries

     The $24.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations,
the $291.7 million of aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by the unrestricted subsidiaries attributed to the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group, represented available liquidity at the corporate level at December 31, 2015. Our remaining cash
and cash equivalents of $690.4 million at December 31, 2015 were held by our borrowing groups as set forth in the table above.
As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the cash of our borrowing groups. For information regarding certain
limitations imposed by our subsidiaries’ debt instruments at December 31, 2015, see note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements.

     Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain
tax and legal considerations, Liberty Global’s unrestricted subsidiaries, and (ii) interest and dividend income received on our and,
subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries’ cash and cash equivalents and investments. In addition,
our parent entity’s short-term liquidity is supplemented by interest payments that it receives on a note receivable from one of our
unrestricted subsidiaries (outstanding principal of $9.6 billion at December 31, 2015, all outstanding principal due in 2021).

     From time to time, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of distributions
or loan repayments from Liberty Global’s borrowing groups or affiliates upon (a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings,
asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii)
proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries and (iii) proceeds
in connection with the incurrence of debt by Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by
Liberty Global, including equity securities issued to satisfy subsidiary obligations. No assurance can be given that any external
funding would be available to Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all. For information regarding
the disposition of the Chellomedia Disposal Group, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

     At December 31, 2015, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance includes $919.6 million that is held by entities
that are domiciled outside of the U.K. Based on our assessment of our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax
efficient basis and our expectations with respect to our corporate liquidity requirements, we do not anticipate that tax considerations
will adversely impact our corporate liquidity over the next 12 months. Our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a
tax efficient basis is a consideration in assessing the extent of our share repurchase program.

     Our corporate liquidity requirements include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses, (ii) interest payments on the
Sumitomo Collar Loan and (iii) principal payments on the ITV Collar Loan, the Sumitomo Collar Loan and the Lionsgate Loan
to the extent not settled through the delivery of the underlying shares. In addition, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries
may require cash in connection with (a) the repayment of third-party and intercompany debt, (b) the satisfaction of contingent
liabilities, (c) acquisitions, (d) the repurchase of equity and debt securities, (e) other investment opportunities or (f) income tax
payments. In addition, our parent entity uses available liquidity to make interest and principal payments on notes payable to certain
of our unrestricted subsidiaries (aggregate outstanding principal of $2,439.4 million at December 31, 2015 and no stated maturity).
For information regarding our pending acquisition of CWC, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. For information
regarding our commitments and contingencies, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

    As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our “Distributable
Reserves.” Distributable Reserves, which are not linked to a GAAP reported amount, may be created through the earnings of the
U.K. parent company and, amongst other methods, through a reduction in share premium approved by the English Companies
Court. Based on the amounts set forth in our 2014 U.K. Companies Act Report dated April 27, 2015, which are our most recent
“Relevant Accounts” for the purposes of determining our Distributable Reserves under U.K. law, our Distributable Reserves are
$27.9 billion. This amount does not reflect earnings, share repurchases or other activity that occurred in 2015, each of which
impacts the amount of our Distributable Reserves.

     During 2015, we purchased a total of 31,331,206 Class C Liberty Global Shares at a weighted average price of $44.97 per
share and 18,653,356 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares at a weighted average price of $50.17 per share, for an aggregate purchase
price of $2,344.5 million, including direct acquisition costs and the effects of derivative instruments. At December 31, 2015, the
remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was $1,601.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, our board of directors
increased this amount to $4.0 billion.


                                                                II-65
  Liquidity of borrowing groups

     The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents,
the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their
respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of such entities at December 31, 2015, see note 10 to our
consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by contributions
and/or loans from Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries. The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally is used to fund
property and equipment additions and debt service requirements. From time to time, our borrowing groups may also require
liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to Liberty Global, (iii) capital distributions
to Liberty Global and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingencies. No assurance can be given that any external
funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. For information regarding the liquidity
requirements with respect to Telenet’s acquisition of BASE, see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. For information
regarding our borrowing groups’ contingencies, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

    For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows below.

  Capitalization

     We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard,
we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance
(excluding the Sumitomo Collar Loan, the ITV Collar Loan and the Lionsgate Loan and measured using subsidiary debt figures
at swapped foreign currency exchange rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt
agreements) that is between four and five times our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA, although it should be noted that the timing of
our acquisitions and financing transactions and the interplay of average and spot foreign currency rates may impact this ratio. The
ratio of our December 31, 2015 consolidated debt to our annualized consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter ended
December 31, 2015 was 4.9x. In addition, the ratio of our December 31, 2015 consolidated net debt (debt, as defined above, less
cash and cash equivalents) to our annualized consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was 4.8x.

    When it is cost effective, we generally seek to match the denomination of the borrowings of our subsidiaries with the functional
currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings. As further discussed under Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk below and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, we also use derivative instruments
to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments.

     Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements
and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted OIBDA of our
operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our
ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our
borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted OIBDA of UPC Broadband Holding were to decline, we could be required to
partially repay or limit our borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with
applicable covenants. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources of liquidity, or that any external funding
would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such required repayment. At December 31, 2015, each of our borrowing
groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance with respect
to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12
months.

     At December 31, 2015, our outstanding consolidated debt and capital lease obligations aggregated $47.1 billion, including
$2,537.9 million that is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet and $42.0 billion that is not due until 2021 or
thereafter. For additional information concerning our current debt maturities, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

     Notwithstanding our negative working capital position at December 31, 2015, we believe that we have sufficient resources
to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements
during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance
or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions
or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign
debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our
future liquidity and financial position. However, (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties could (a) reduce amounts
available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial
institution and (ii) tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms,
                                                                   II-66
or at all. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or
other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory
developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity.

    All of our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at December 31,
2015.

     For additional information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements.

     Operating Activities. Our net cash flows from operating activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                          Year ended December 31,

    Total............................................................................................................ $       5,705.8   $     5,612.8   $         93.0

      The increase in total net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase
in the cash provided by our Adjusted OIBDA and related working capital items, largely due to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition,
(ii) a decrease in the reported net cash provided by operating activities due to FX, (iii) a decrease in cash provided due to higher
cash payments for taxes, (iv) an increase in cash provided due to lower cash payments related to derivative instruments and (v) a
decrease in cash provided due to higher cash payments for interest.

     The increase in total net cash used by our investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash
of $988.5 million associated with cash proceeds received during 2014 in connection with the Chellomedia Transaction, (ii) an
increase in cash used of $312.5 million associated with higher cash paid in connection with acquisitions and (iii) a decrease in
cash used of $184.9 million due to lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased from $2,684.4 million during 2014
to $2,499.5 million during 2015 due to the net effect of (a) an increase related to the Ziggo Acquisition, (b) a decrease due to FX
and (c) a net decrease in the local currency capital expenditures of our subsidiaries, primarily due to an increase in capital-related
vendor financing during 2015 as compared to 2014.

     The capital expenditures that we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed
under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions
to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid.
In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude
amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements, and (ii) our total property and equipment
additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing
or capital lease arrangements. For further details regarding our property and equipment additions, see note 18 to our consolidated
financial statements. A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures
as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows is set forth below:

     The property and equipment additions attributable to the Liberty Global Group are primarily related to the European Operations
Division, which accounted for $3,844.3 million and $3,648.0 million of the Liberty Global Group’s property and equipment
additions during 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the European Operations Division’s property and equipment additions
is due to the net effect of (i) a decrease due to FX, (ii) an increase due to the impact of the Ziggo Acquisition, (iii) an increase in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects to expand service, (iv) an increase in expenditures for support capital, such as
information technology upgrades and general support systems, and (v) a decrease in expenditures for the purchase and installation
of customer premises equipment. During 2015 and 2014, the European Operations Division’s property and equipment additions
represented 22.6% and 21.5% of its revenue, respectively.

    Property and equipment additions attributable to the LiLAC Group decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily
due to the net effect of (i) a decrease due to FX, (ii) an increase due to the impact of the Choice Acquisition, (iii) a decrease in
expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems, (iv) a decrease in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects to expand service, and (v) a decrease in expenditures for the purchase and
                                                                                           II-68
installation of customer premises equipment. During 2015, approximately half of VTR’s purchases of property and equipment
were denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2015 and 2014, the LiLAC Group’s property and equipment additions represented 18.7%
and 21.3% of its revenue, respectively.

     Excluding BASE and CWC, we expect the percentage of revenue represented by our aggregate 2016 consolidated property
and equipment additions to range from 25% to 27%, including (i) 25% to 27% for the Liberty Global Group and (ii) 21% to 23%
for the LiLAC Group. The increases in these percentages, as compared to the corresponding 2015 percentages, are primarily
attributable to anticipated increases in expenditures associated with the Network Extensions. For additional information regarding
the Network Extensions, see Overview above. The actual amount of our 2016 consolidated property and equipment additions and
the 2016 property and equipment additions of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group may vary from expected amounts
for a variety of reasons, including (a) changes in (1) the competitive or regulatory environment, (2) business plans, (3) our current
or expected future operating results or (4) foreign currency exchange rates and (b) the availability of sufficient capital. Accordingly,
no assurance can be given that our actual property and equipment additions will not vary materially from our expectations.

     Financing Activities. Our net cash flows from financing activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                           Year ended December 31,

     The decrease in total net cash used by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in
cash used of $3,092.7 million related to higher net borrowings of debt, (ii) an increase in cash used of $735.6 million due to higher
repurchases of Liberty Global ordinary shares, (iii) a decrease in cash used of $118.3 million related to a decrease in purchases of
additional shares of our subsidiaries, (iv) an increase in cash used of $80.2 million due to higher cash paid related to derivative
instruments, (v) an increase in cash used of $43.5 million due to higher payments for financing costs, debt premiums and exchange
offer consideration and (vi) an increase in cash used of $36.6 million associated with call option contracts on Liberty Global
ordinary shares.

     Operating Activities. Our net cash flows from operating activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                       Year ended December 31,

     The increase in net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in the
cash provided by our Adjusted OIBDA and related working capital items, largely due to the impact of the Virgin Media Acquisition
and, to a lesser extent, the Ziggo Acquisition, (ii) a decrease in cash provided due to higher cash payments for interest, a significant
portion of which is due to the impact of the Virgin Media Acquisition, (iii) an increase in the reported net cash provided by operating
activities due to FX, (iv) a decrease in cash provided due to lower cash dividends received and (v) a decrease in cash provided
due to higher cash payments related to derivative instruments.

     Investing Activities. Our net cash flows from investing activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                       Year ended December 31,

     The decrease in net cash used by our investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash used
of $4,000.1 million associated with lower cash paid in connection with acquisitions, (ii) a decrease in cash used of $988.5 million
associated with cash proceeds received during 2014 in connection with the Chellomedia Transaction, (iii) a decrease in cash used
of $333.7 million associated with lower cash paid in connection with investments in and loans to affiliates and others and (iv) an
increase in cash used of $202.9 million due to higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures increased from $2,481.5 million
during 2013 to $2,684.4 million during 2014, primarily due to increases related to the Virgin Media Acquisition and, to a much
lesser extent, the Ziggo Acquisition, that were only partially offset by a net decrease in the local currency capital expenditures of
our other subsidiaries, due primarily to an increase in vendor financing during 2014 as compared to 2013.

     A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures as reported
in our consolidated statements of cash flows is set forth below:

     The property and equipment additions attributable to the Liberty Global Group are primarily related to the European Operations
Division, which accounted for $3,648.0 million and $2,901.0 million of the Liberty Global Group’s property and equipment
additions during 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the European Operations Division’s property and equipment additions
is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase due to impact of the Virgin Media Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the Ziggo
Acquisition, (ii) a decrease in expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment, (iii) an increase in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects to expand services and (iv) an increase in expenditures for support capital, such
as information technology upgrades and general support systems. During 2014 and 2013, the European Operations Division’s
property and equipment additions represented 21.5% and 22.1% of its revenue, respectively.

     Property and equipment additions attributable to the LiLAC Group increased during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily
due to the net effect of (i) a decrease due to FX, (ii) an increase in expenditures for new build and upgrade projects, (iii) an increase
in expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems, and (iv) an increase in
expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment. During 2014 and 2013, the LiLAC Group’s property
and equipment additions represented 21.3% and 19.7% of its revenue, respectively.

     Financing Activities. Our net cash flows from financing activities are as follows:
                                                                                                                           Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                                            2014             2013            Change
                                                                                                                                          in millions

Net cash provided (used) by financing activities:
 Liberty Global Group...................................................................................... $                (4,574.8) $       4,517.4   $    (9,092.2)
 LiLAC Group ..................................................................................................                (118.0)           101.2          (219.2)
  Inter-group eliminations..................................................................................                    432.7              4.7           428.0
     Total............................................................................................................ $     (4,260.1) $       4,623.3   $    (8,883.4)

     The change in net cash provided (used) by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease
in cash of $3,652.5 million primarily due to the release of restricted cash in June 2013 in connection with the Virgin Media
Acquisition, (ii) a decrease in cash of $3,095.4 million related to lower net borrowings of debt, (iii) a decrease in cash of $1,539.7
million due to the release of restricted cash during 2013 in connection with the Telenet Tender, (iv) a decrease in cash of $745.5
million due to higher cash paid related to derivative instruments, (v) an increase in cash of $528.9 million related to lower
distributions by subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests, (vi) a decrease in cash of $427.7 million related to higher repurchases of
our shares and (vii) an increase in cash of $200.6 million related to a decrease in purchases of additional shares of our subsidiaries.

  Free cash flow

     We define free cash flow as net cash provided by our operating activities, plus (i) excess tax benefits related to the exercise
of share-based incentive awards, (ii) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful
acquisitions and dispositions and (iii) expenses financed by an intermediary, less (a) capital expenditures, as reported in our
consolidated statements of cash flows, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and (c) principal
payments on capital leases (exclusive of the portions of the network lease in Belgium and the duct leases in Germany that we
assumed in connection with certain acquisitions), with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued
operations. We believe that our presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to our investors because this measure
can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Free cash flow should not be understood
to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt
repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view free cash flow as a supplement to, and not a
substitute for, GAAP measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

_______________

(a)     Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation represent the excess of tax deductions over the related financial reporting
        share-based compensation expense. The hypothetical cash flows associated with these excess tax benefits are reported as
        an increase to cash flows from financing activities and a corresponding decrease to cash flows from operating activities in
        our consolidated statements of cash flows.

(b)     For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, expenses financed by an intermediary are treated as hypothetical
        operating cash outflows and hypothetical financing cash inflows when the expenses are incurred. When we pay the financing
        intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our free cash
        flow definition, we add back the hypothetical operating cash outflow when these financed expenses are incurred and deduct
        the financing cash outflows when we pay the financing intermediary. The inclusion of this adjustment represents a change
        in our definition of free cash flow that we implemented effective January 1, 2015. The free cash flow reported for 2014 and
        2013 has been revised to calculate free cash flow on a basis that is consistent with the new definition.

(a)     The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our December 31, 2015 consolidated
        balance sheet other than debt and capital lease obligations. Our liability for uncertain tax positions in the various jurisdictions
        in which we operate ($437.9 million at December 31, 2015) has been excluded from the table as the amount and timing of
        any related payments are not subject to reasonable estimation.

(b)     Amounts are based on interest rates, interest payment dates, commitment fees and contractual maturities in effect as of
        December 31, 2015. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from the actual cash
        payments required in future periods. In addition, the amounts presented do not include the impact of our interest rate
        derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts.

     For information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. For
information concerning our commitments, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

     In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments
and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For
information regarding projected cash flows associated with these derivative instruments, see Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk — Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivatives below. For information regarding our
derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during 2015, 2014 and 2013,
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. For information concerning our defined benefit plans, see note 15 to our
consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

     In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties,
which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following
accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to
account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change:


                                                                        II-73
    •    Impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill);
    •    Costs associated with construction and installation activities;
    •    Useful lives of long-lived assets;
    •    Fair value measurements; and
    •    Income tax accounting.
     We have discussed the selection of the aforementioned critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of
directors. For additional information concerning our significant accounting policies, see note 3 to our consolidated financial
statements.

  Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

    Carrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill) that
were held for use comprised 83.2% of our total assets at December 31, 2015.

     We review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets (other
than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse
changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which
we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see
below). If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying
value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar
assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets
to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

     We evaluate the goodwill, franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on
October 1 and whenever other facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired.
In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare
the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below
an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). In most cases, our operating segments are deemed to be a reporting unit
either because the operating segment is comprised of only a single component, or the components below the operating segment
are aggregated as they have similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value,
we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to franchise rights or other indefinite-
lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying
value, we then estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the franchise right or other indefinite-
lived intangible asset is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.

     When required, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of reporting units and underlying
long-lived and indefinite-lived assets. The equity of one of our reporting units, Telenet, is publicly traded in an active market. For
this reporting unit, our fair value determination is based on quoted market prices. For other reporting units, we typically determine
fair value using an income-based approach (discounted cash flows) based on assumptions in our long-range business plans and,
in some cases, a combination of an income-based approach and a market-based approach. With respect to our discounted cash
flow analysis used in the income-based approach, the timing and amount of future cash flows under these business plans require
estimates, among other items, of subscriber growth and retention rates, rates charged per product, expected gross margins and
Adjusted OIBDA margins and expected property and equipment additions. The development of these cash flows, and the discount
rate applied to the cash flows, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
Our determination of the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital approach, which uses a market participant’s
cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. Based on the results of our 2015 qualitative
assessment of our reporting unit carrying values, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that fair value exceeded carrying
value for all of our reporting units.



                                                                   II-74
    During the three years ended December 31, 2015, the most significant impairment charges that we recorded with respect to
our property and equipment and intangible assets were (i) the $73.0 million impairment charge that Telenet recorded during the
fourth quarter of 2013 to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to certain of its spectrum rights and (ii) the
$68.7 million impairment charge that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2014 to reduce the carrying amount of certain of
Ziggo’s internal-use software assets. For additional information, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

     If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive,
regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude
in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent,
other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

  Costs Associated with Construction and Installation Activities

     We capitalize costs associated with the construction of new cable transmission and distribution facilities and the installation
of new cable services. Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection (or drop) from our cable system
to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of equipment for additional services, such as digital
cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-facing activities, such as reconnecting customer
locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as
incurred.

     The nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves
significant judgment. In addition to direct external and internal labor and materials, we also capitalize other costs directly attributable
to our construction and installation activities, including dispatch costs, quality-control costs, vehicle-related costs and certain
warehouse-related costs. The capitalization of these costs is based on time sheets, time studies, standard costs, call tracking systems
and other verifiable means that directly link the costs incurred with the applicable capitalizable activity. We continuously monitor
the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and update the policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and
circumstances, such as the development of new products and services, and changes in the manner that installations or construction
activities are performed.

  Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets

     We depreciate our property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The determination
of the useful lives of property and equipment requires significant management judgment, based on factors such as the estimated
physical lives of the assets, technological changes, changes in anticipated use, legal and economic factors, rebuild and equipment
swap-out plans, and other factors. Our intangible assets with finite lives primarily consist of customer relationships. Customer
relationship intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated weighted average life of the customer
relationships. The determination of the estimated useful life of customer relationship intangible assets requires significant
management judgment and is primarily based on historical and forecasted subscriber disconnect rates, adjusted when necessary
for risk associated with demand, competition, technological changes and other economic factors. We regularly review whether
changes to estimated useful lives are required in order to accurately reflect the economic use of our property and equipment and
intangible assets with finite lives. Any changes to estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Depreciation and amortization
expense of our continuing operations during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $5,825.8 million, $5,500.1 million and $4,276.4 million,
respectively. A 10% increase in the aggregate amount of the depreciation and amortization expense of our continuing operations
during 2015 would have resulted in a $582.6 million or 24.8% decrease in our 2015 operating income.

  Fair Value Measurements

     GAAP provides guidance with respect to the recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements and for a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted
market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement
date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

     Recurring Valuations. We perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to our derivative instruments and fair value
method investments, each of which are carried at fair value. We use (i) cash flow valuation models to determine the fair values of
our interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and (ii) a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair values
of our equity-related derivative instruments. We use quoted market prices when available and, when not available, we use a
combination of an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (market multiples of similar businesses) to
determine the fair value of our fair value method investments. For a detailed discussion of the inputs we use to determine the fair
                                                               II-75
value of our derivative instruments and fair value method investments, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. See
also notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning our fair value method investments and
derivative instruments, respectively.

     Changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments and fair value method investments have had, and we believe will
continue to have, a significant and volatile impact on our results of operations. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, our continuing
operations included net gains (losses) of $971.7 million, $294.0 million and ($496.3 million), respectively, attributable to changes
in the fair values of these items.

    As further described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, actual amounts received or paid upon the settlement
of our derivative instruments or disposal of our fair value method investments may differ materially from the recorded fair values
at December 31, 2015.

    For information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes
in market conditions, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Sensitivity Information below.

     Nonrecurring Valuations. Our nonrecurring valuations are primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition
accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable
valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts,
including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-
lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from
acquired net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage
third-party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization,
impairment charges and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we
believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded
through the application of acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to impairment assessments. For
additional information, see notes 4, 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Income Tax Accounting

     We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income
tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted
tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. This process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the
ultimate tax impact of such items.

     Net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if we believe it more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Establishing or reducing a tax valuation allowance requires us to make assessments about the timing of future
events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2015,
the aggregate valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets was $6,395.6 million. The actual amount of deferred income
tax benefits realized in future periods will likely differ from the net deferred tax assets reflected in our December 31, 2015
consolidated balance sheet due to, among other factors, possible future changes in income tax law or interpretations thereof in the
jurisdictions in which we operate and differences between estimated and actual future taxable income. Any of such factors could
have a material effect on our current and deferred tax positions as reported in our consolidated financial statements. A high degree
of judgment is required to assess the impact of possible future outcomes on our current and deferred tax positions.

     Tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have a presence are subject to varied interpretation, and many tax positions we take are
subject to significant uncertainty regarding whether the position will be ultimately sustained after review by the relevant tax
authority. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits,
that the position will be sustained upon examination. The determination of whether the tax position meets the more-likely-than-
not threshold requires a facts-based judgment using all information available. In a number of cases, we have concluded that the
more-likely-than-not threshold is not met and, accordingly, the amount of tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial
statements is different than the amount taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits for financial reporting purposes, but taken or expected to be taken on tax returns, was $609.9 million,
of which $299.4 million would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering
amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances.


                                                                 II-76
     We are required to continually assess our tax positions, and the results of tax examinations or changes in judgment can result
in substantial changes to our unrecognized tax benefits.

     We have taxable outside basis differences on certain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We do not recognize the deferred
tax liabilities associated with these outside basis differences when the difference is considered essentially permanent in duration.
In order to be considered essentially permanent in duration, sufficient evidence must indicate that the foreign subsidiary has
invested or will invest its undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. If
circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings will be remitted on a taxable basis
in the foreseeable future, a net deferred tax liability must be recorded for some or all of the outside basis difference. The assessment
of whether these outside basis differences are considered permanent in nature requires significant judgment and is based on
management’s intentions to reinvest the earnings of a foreign subsidiary indefinitely in light of anticipated liquidity requirements
and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2015, income and withholding taxes for which a net deferred tax liability might
otherwise be required have not been provided on an estimated $9.1 billion of cumulative temporary differences on non-U.S.
entities, including cumulative translation adjustments. If our plans or intentions change in the future due to liquidity or other
relevant considerations, we could decide that it would be prudent to repatriate significant funds or other assets from one or more
of our subsidiaries, even though we would incur a tax liability in connection with any such repatriation. If our plans or intentions
were to change in this manner, the recognition of all or a part of these outside basis differences could have an adverse impact on
our consolidated net loss.

    For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.




                                                                 II-77
Item 7A . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various foreign
countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse
changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and
processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

  Cash and Investments

     We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk
to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources
of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of our and our subsidiaries’ short-term liquidity requirements. In order to
mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in light of our and our subsidiaries’ forecasted
liquidity requirements. At December 31, 2015, $627.8 million or 63.9%, $210.4 million or 21.4%, $92.2 million or 9.4% and
$76.7 million or 7.8% of our consolidated cash balances were denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, Chilean pesos and British pounds
sterling, respectively.

     We are also exposed to market price fluctuations related to our investments in ITV, Sumitomo and Lionsgate shares. At
December 31, 2015, the aggregate fair value of these investments was $1,624.1 million, $471.1 million and $162.0 million,
respectively. All of our ITV and Sumitomo shares, and a portion of our Lionsgate shares, are held through the ITV Collar, the
Sumitomo Collar and the Lionsgate Forward, respectively. For information concerning the terms of the ITV Collar and related
ITV Collar Loan, the Sumitomo Collar and related Sumitomo Collar Loan and the Lionsgate Forward and related Lionsgate Loan,
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. For those shares that are subject to the ITV Collar, the Sumitomo Collar and
the Lionsgate Forward, our exposure to market risk is limited. For additional information concerning our investments in ITV,
Sumitomo and Lionsgate shares, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Foreign Currency Risk

     We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or
refinance such debt. Although we generally seek to match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the
functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause
us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched
debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using
derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2015,
substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying
operations. For additional information concerning the terms of our derivative instruments, see note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements.

     In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are
exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts,
notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in
our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In this regard, we currently expect
that during 2016, (i) less than 1% of our revenue, (ii) approximately 3% to 5% of our aggregate operating and SG&A expenses
(exclusive of share-based compensation expense) and (iii) approximately 7% to 9% of our property and equipment additions will
be denominated in non-functional currencies, including amounts denominated in (a) U.S. dollars in Chile and Europe and (b) euros
in the U.K., Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland and Hungary. Our expectations with respect to our non-functional
currency transactions in 2016 may differ from actual results. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks
when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items
to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are
not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks.
Certain non-functional currency risks related to our revenue, operating and SG&A expenses and property and equipment additions
were not hedged as of December 31, 2015. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note
7 to our consolidated financial statements.
                                                                  II-78
      We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against
the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings (loss) as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign
currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency
translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a
negative impact on our comprehensive earnings (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of FX. Our primary
exposure to FX risk during the three months ended December 31, 2015 was to the euro and British pound sterling as 43.8% and
37.0% of our U.S. dollar revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and
British pound sterling, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for
the Swiss franc, the Chilean peso and other local currencies in Europe. We generally do not hedge against the risk that we may
incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. For
information regarding certain currency instability risks with respect to the euro, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview above.

     The relationship between (i) the euro, the British pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Hungarian forint, the Polish zloty, the
Czech koruna, the Romanian lei and the Chilean peso and (ii) the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, is shown below,
per one U.S. dollar:

                                                                                                                                                              2015         2014

  Inflation and Foreign Investment Risk

    We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to labor, programming and other costs. While we attempt to increase our
revenue to offset increases in costs, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Therefore, costs could rise faster than
associated revenue, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. The economic
environment in the respective countries in which we operate is a function of government, economic, fiscal and monetary policies
and various other factors beyond our control that could lead to inflation. We are unable to predict the extent that price levels might
be impacted in future periods by the current state of the economies in the countries in which we operate.


                                                                                              II-79
  Interest Rate Risks

    We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include
fixed-rate and variable-rate investments and borrowings by our borrowing groups. Our primary exposure to variable-rate debt is
through the EURIBOR-indexed and LIBOR-indexed debt of UPC Broadband Holding and Ziggo, the LIBOR-indexed debt of
Virgin Media, the EURIBOR-indexed debt of Telenet and Unitymedia and the variable-rate debt of certain of our other subsidiaries.

     In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate
debt. Accordingly, we have entered into various derivative transactions to reduce exposure to increases in interest rates. We use
interest rate derivative contracts to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated
by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We also use interest rate cap and collar agreements that lock in a
maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from
declines in market rates. At December 31, 2015, we effectively paid a fixed interest rate on 97% of our total debt. The final maturity
dates of our various portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments generally fall short of the respective maturities of the underlying
variable-rate debt. In this regard, we use judgment to determine the appropriate maturity dates of our portfolios of interest rate
derivative instruments, taking into account the relative costs and benefits of different maturity profiles in light of current and
expected future market conditions, liquidity issues and other factors. For additional information concerning the terms of these
interest rate derivative instruments, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

     Weighted Average Variable Interest Rate. At December 31, 2015, our variable-rate indebtedness aggregated $14.5 billion,
and the weighted average interest rate (including margin) on such variable-rate indebtedness was approximately 3.7%, excluding
the effects of interest rate derivative contracts, financing costs, discounts or commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost
of borrowing. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding, and without giving effect to any interest rate derivative contracts,
financing costs, discounts or commitment fees, a hypothetical 50 basis point (0.50%) increase (decrease) in our weighted average
variable interest rate would increase (decrease) our annual consolidated interest expense and cash outflows by $72.5 million. As
discussed above and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our
exposure to increases in variable interest rates. In this regard, increases in the fair value of these contracts generally would be
expected to offset most of the economic impact of increases in the variable interest rates applicable to our indebtedness to the
extent and during the period that principal amounts are matched with interest rate derivative contracts.

  Counterparty Credit Risk

     We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments
of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation
and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk
associated with our derivative instruments and undrawn debt facilities is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of
banks and financial institutions. Collateral is generally not posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary
borrowing groups. Most of our cash currently is invested in either (i) AAA credit rated money market funds, including funds that
invest in government obligations, or (ii) overnight deposits with banks having a minimum credit rating of A by Standard & Poor’s
or an equivalent rating by Moody’s Investor Service. To date, neither the access to nor the value of our cash and cash equivalent
balances have been adversely impacted by liquidity problems of financial institutions.

     At December 31, 2015, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (i) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of
$2,025.2 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,110.0 million and (iii) aggregate undrawn debt
facilities of $3,910.6 million.

     Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each
counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such
derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative
instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar
arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups.

    Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination
payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty.
                                                                II-80
Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed
to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty,
even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our
ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we
will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value
of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty.

    In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may
be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel,
without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant
counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

     While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material
credit risk exposures, the current economic conditions and uncertainties in global financial markets have increased the credit risk
of our counterparties and we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable
to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial
condition and/or liquidity.

    Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key vendors, the financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our
operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows.

  Sensitivity Information

    Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes
in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated
with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency. For additional information, see
notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Virgin Media Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015:

    (i)     an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar would
            have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Virgin Media cross-currency and interest rate derivative
            contracts by approximately £464 million ($684 million);

    (ii)    an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased (decreased)
            the aggregate fair value of the Virgin Media cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately £56
            million ($83 million); and

    (iii)   an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased
            (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Virgin Media cross-currency contracts by approximately £33 million ($49
            million).

  UPC Broadband Holding Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015:

    (i)     an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the Swiss franc, Polish zloty, Czech koruna and Hungarian
            forint relative to the euro would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the UPC Broadband Holding
            cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately €457 million ($497 million);

    (ii)    an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased
            (increased) the aggregate fair value of the UPC Broadband Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts
            by approximately €275 million ($299 million);

    (iii)   an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the Swiss franc and Romanian lei relative to the U.S. dollar
            would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the UPC Broadband Holding cross-currency and interest
            rate derivative contracts by approximately €120 million ($130 million); and
                                                               II-81
    (iv)   an instantaneous increase in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased the aggregate fair
           value of the UPC Broadband Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately €54 million
           ($59 million) and, conversely, a decrease of 50 basis points would have decreased the aggregate fair value by
           approximately €60 million ($65 million).

  Ziggo Group Holding Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015:

    (i)    an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased
           (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Ziggo cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately
           €309 million ($336 million); and

    (ii)   an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased (decreased)
           the aggregate fair value of the Ziggo cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately €143 million
           ($155 million).

  Unitymedia Cross-currency Derivative Contracts

     Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015, an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the euro
relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased (increased) the aggregate value of the Unitymedia cross-currency derivative
contracts by approximately €242 million ($263 million).

  Telenet Interest Rate Caps, Collars and Swaps

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015, an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50
basis points (0.50%) would have increased (decreased) the aggregate fair value of the Telenet interest rate cap, collar and swap
contracts by approximately €62 million ($67 million).

  VTR Cross-currency Derivative Contracts

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015, an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the
Chilean peso relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the VTR cross-currency
derivative contracts by approximately CLP 108.5 billion ($153 million).

  ITV Collar

     Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015, an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the per share market
price of ITV’s ordinary shares would have decreased (increased) the fair value of the ITV Collar by approximately £107 million
($158 million).

  Sumitomo Collar

     Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2015, an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the per share market
price of Sumitomo’s common stock would have decreased (increased) the fair value of the Sumitomo Collar by approximately
¥5.4 billion ($45 million).

Executives concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2015, in timely making known

                            Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting


     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     Our management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, using the
criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2015. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein. Our evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal control of the following entities that we acquired in 2015:

                                                                                                                                  Total revenue included

                                       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
Liberty Global plc:

We have audited Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded the following entities that were acquired in 2015:

                                                                                                   Total assets included in    Total revenue included in

The Board of Directors
Liberty Global plc:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited financial statement schedules I and II. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report
dated February 12, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

                                           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                               December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013

(1)      Basis of Presentation

    Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global) is a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales. In these
notes, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global or collectively to Liberty
Global and its subsidiaries.

     We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services, with consolidated
operations at December 31, 2015 in 14 countries. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media), we
provide video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland. Through
Ziggo Group Holding B.V. (Ziggo Group Holding) and Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia), each a wholly-owned subsidiary, and
Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet), a 56.9%-owned subsidiary, we provide video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and
mobile services in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, respectively. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary UPC Holding B.V.
(UPC Holding), we provide (i) video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in seven other European countries and
(ii) mobile services in four other European countries. The operations of Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia, Telenet
and UPC Holding are collectively referred to herein as the “European Operations Division.” In Chile, we provide video, broadband
internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services through our wholly-owned subsidiary VTR GlobalCom SpA (VTR). In Puerto
Rico, we provide video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services through Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC
(Liberty Puerto Rico), an entity in which we hold a 60.0% ownership interest. The operations of VTR and Liberty Puerto Rico
are collectively referred to herein as the “LiLAC Division.”

     On July 1, 2015, we completed the approved steps of the “LiLAC Transaction” whereby we (i) reclassified our then outstanding
Class A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares into corresponding classes of new Liberty Global ordinary shares
(collectively, the Liberty Global Shares) and (ii) capitalized a portion of our share premium account and distributed as a dividend
(or a “bonus issue” under U.K. law) our LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the LiLAC Shares).
In these notes, the term “Old Liberty Global Shares” may refer, as the context requires, to (a) our previously-outstanding Class
A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares and/or (b) the previously-outstanding Series A, Series B and Series C
common stock of Liberty Global, Inc. (LGI) (the predecessor to Liberty Global). Pursuant to the LiLAC Transaction, each holder
of Class A, Class B and Class C Old Liberty Global Shares remained a holder of the same amount and class of Liberty Global
Shares and received one share of the corresponding class of LiLAC Shares for each 20 Old Liberty Global Shares held as of the
record date for such distribution. Accordingly, we issued 12,625,362 Class A, 523,626 Class B and 30,776,883 Class C LiLAC
Shares. Cash was issued in lieu of fractional LiLAC Shares. The impact of the LiLAC Transaction on our capitalization and earnings
(loss) per share presentation has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements prospectively from July 1, 2015.
Accordingly, (1) our net earnings (loss) attributed to Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares relates to the period from July 1,
2015 through December 31, 2015 and (2) our net loss attributed to Old Liberty Global Shares relates to periods prior to July 1,
2015.

     The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are tracking shares. Tracking shares are intended by the issuing company
to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic performance of the
company as a whole. The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are intended to track the economic performance of the
Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, respectively (each as defined and described below). While the Liberty Global Group
and the LiLAC Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, neither group is a separate
legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking shares
have no direct claim to the group’s assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking
shares are shareholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors, and are subject to all of the risks and liabilities
of the parent corporation. We and our subsidiaries each continue to be responsible for our respective liabilities. Holders of Liberty
Global Shares, LiLAC Shares and any other of our capital shares designated as ordinary shares from time to time will continue to
be subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both Liberty Global
Shares and LiLAC Shares.

      The “LiLAC Group” comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed
to it (i) VTR Finance B.V. (VTR Finance) and its subsidiaries, which include VTR, (ii) Lila Chile Holding B.V., which is the
parent entity of VTR Finance, (iii) LiLAC Holdings Inc. (LiLAC Holdings) and its subsidiaries, which include Liberty Puerto
Rico, (iv) LGE Coral Holdco Limited and its subsidiary, which were formed in anticipation of the acquisition of CWC (as described
and defined in note 4), and (v) prior to July 1, 2015, the costs associated with certain corporate employees of Liberty Global that
are exclusively focused on the management of the LiLAC Group (the LiLAC Corporate Costs). Effective July 1, 2015, these
corporate employees were transferred to LiLAC Holdings. The “Liberty Global Group” comprises our businesses, assets and

     For additional information regarding our tracking share capital structure, including unaudited attributed financial information
of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    On January 31, 2014, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets (the Chellomedia Disposal Group) of Chellomedia
B.V. (Chellomedia) (the Chellomedia Transaction). Chellomedia held certain of our programming interests in Europe and Latin
America. We have accounted for the sale of the Chellomedia Disposal Group as a discontinued operation in our consolidated
financial statements. For additional information regarding our discontinued operation, see note 5.

     Unless otherwise indicated, ownership percentages and convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated
as of December 31, 2015.

(2)       Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  Accounting Changes

    In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes,
ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective
December 31, 2015 and, accordingly, all of our deferred tax balances are reflected as noncurrent in our December 31, 2015
consolidated balance sheet. Our December 31, 2014 deferred tax balances have not been retroactively revised.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which requires
an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers. ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU No. 2015-14, will replace existing revenue recognition accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) when it becomes effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods that begin after December 15,
2016. This new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We will adopt ASU
2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of
the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

(3)       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation
of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, programming and copyright expenses, deferred
income taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair value measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization
of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities, useful lives of long-lived assets, share-based compensation
and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Reclassifications

      Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.




                                                                II-99
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


  Principles of Consolidation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all voting interest entities where
we exercise a controlling financial interest through the ownership of a direct or indirect controlling voting interest and variable
interest entities for which our company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

     Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and other investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities
of three months or less at the time of acquisition. We record money market funds at the net asset value reported by the investment
manager as there are no restrictions on our ability, contractual or otherwise, to redeem our investments at the stated net asset value
reported by the investment manager.

     Restricted cash consists of cash held in restricted accounts, including cash held as collateral for debt and other compensating
balances. Restricted cash amounts that are required to be used to purchase long-term assets or repay long-term debt are classified
as long-term assets. All other cash that is restricted to a specific use is classified as current or long-term based on the expected
timing of the disbursement. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our aggregate current and long-term restricted cash balances
aggregated $127.9 million and $78.0 million, respectively.

     Our significant non-cash investing and financing activities are disclosed in our consolidated statements of equity and in notes
4, 7, 9, and 10.

  Trade Receivables

     Our trade receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Such allowance aggregated $115.7 million and
$116.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment
of probable loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We use a number of factors in determining the allowance, including,
among other things, collection trends, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk. The
allowance is maintained until either payment is received or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote.

     Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion
across many different countries worldwide. We also manage this risk by disconnecting services to customers whose accounts are
delinquent.

  Investments

     We make elections, on an investment-by-investment basis, as to whether we measure our investments at fair value. Such
elections are generally irrevocable. With the exception of those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we
generally elect the fair value method. For those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we generally elect the
equity method.

     Under the fair value method, investments are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value are reported in realized and
unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair values of certain investments, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.
All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment to be accounted for using the fair value method are expensed
as incurred. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are recorded at cost and are subsequently increased or reduced
to reflect the share of income or losses of the investee. All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment to be
accounted for using the equity method are included in the carrying amount of the investment. For additional information regarding
our fair value and equity method investments, see notes 6 and 8.

     Dividends from publicly-traded investees are recognized when declared as dividend income in our consolidated statements
of operations. Dividends from privately-held investees generally are reflected as reductions of the carrying values of the applicable
investments.



                                                                II-100
                                                   LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                               December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


     Under the equity method, investments, originally recorded at cost, are adjusted to recognize our share of net earnings or losses
of the affiliates as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received, with our recognition of losses generally
limited to the extent of our investment in, and advances and commitments to, the investee. The portion of the difference between
our investment and our share of the net assets of the investee that represents goodwill is not amortized, but continues to be considered
for impairment. Intercompany profits on transactions with equity affiliates for which assets remain on our or our investee’s balance
sheet are eliminated to the extent of our ownership in the investee.

     We continually review our equity method investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is
other-than-temporary. The primary factors we consider in our determination are the extent and length of time that the fair value
of the investment is below our company’s carrying value and the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects
of the investee, changes in the stock price or valuation subsequent to the balance sheet date, and the impacts of exchange rates, if
applicable. If the decline in fair value of an equity method investment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the
security is written down to fair value.

    Realized gains and losses are determined on an average cost basis. Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date.

  Financial Instruments

     Due to the short maturities of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term liquid investments, trade and other
receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, subscriber advance payments and deposits and other current
liabilities, their respective carrying values approximate their respective fair values. For information concerning the fair values of
certain of our investments, our derivatives and debt, see notes 6, 7 and 10, respectively. For information concerning how we arrive
at certain of our fair value measurements, see note 8.

  Derivative Instruments

     All derivative instruments, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in
earnings. If the derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument
and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative instrument is designated as a
cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in other comprehensive
earnings or loss and subsequently reclassified into our consolidated statements of operations when the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. With the exception
of a limited number of our foreign currency forward contracts, we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.
For information regarding our derivative instruments, including our policy for classifying cash flows related to derivative
instruments in our consolidated statements of cash flows, see note 7.

  Property and Equipment

      Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. We capitalize costs associated with the construction
of new cable transmission and distribution facilities and the installation of new cable services. Capitalized construction and
installation costs include materials, labor and other directly attributable costs. Installation activities that are capitalized include
(i) the initial connection (or drop) from our cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation
of equipment for additional services, such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-
facing activities such as reconnecting customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and
repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as incurred. Interest capitalized with respect to construction activities was not material
during any of the periods presented.

    Capitalized internal-use software is included as a component of property and equipment. We capitalize internal and external
costs directly associated with the development of internal-use software. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of
software licenses. Maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of an internal-use software
development project, are expensed as incurred.

    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. Equipment
under capital leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.
Useful lives used to depreciate our property and equipment are assessed periodically and are adjusted when warranted. The useful
                                                              II-101

                                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                               December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


lives of cable distribution systems that are undergoing a rebuild are adjusted such that property and equipment to be retired will
be fully depreciated by the time the rebuild is completed. For additional information regarding the useful lives of our property and
equipment, see note 9.

    Additions, replacements and improvements that extend the asset life are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are charged to
operations.

      We recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is incurred if sufficient information is available
to make a reasonable estimate of fair values. Asset retirement obligations may arise from the loss of rights of way that we obtain
from local municipalities or other relevant authorities. Under certain circumstances, the authorities could require us to remove our
network equipment from an area if, for example, we were to discontinue using the equipment for an extended period of time or
the authorities were to decide not to renew our access rights. However, because the rights of way are integral to our ability to
deliver broadband communications services to our customers, we expect to conduct our business in a manner that will allow us
to maintain these rights for the foreseeable future. In addition, we have no reason to believe that the authorities will not renew our
rights of way and, historically, renewals have been granted. We also have obligations in lease agreements to restore the property
to its original condition or remove our property at the end of the lease term. Sufficient information is not available to estimate the
fair value of our asset retirement obligations in certain of our lease arrangements. This is the case for long-term lease arrangements
in which the underlying leased property is integral to our operations, there is not an acceptable alternative to the leased property
and we have the ability to indefinitely renew the lease. Accordingly, for most of our rights of way and certain lease agreements,
the possibility is remote that we will incur significant removal costs in the foreseeable future and, as such, we do not have sufficient
information to make a reasonable estimate of fair value for these asset retirement obligations.

    As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the recorded value of our asset retirement obligations was $63.9 million and $65.1 million,
respectively.

  Intangible Assets

     Our primary intangible assets relate to goodwill, customer relationships and cable television franchise rights. Goodwill
represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Customer
relationships and cable television franchise rights were originally recorded at their fair values in connection with business
combinations.

     Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives
to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment.

     We do not amortize our franchise rights and certain other intangible assets as these assets have indefinite lives. For additional
information regarding the useful lives of our intangible assets, see note 9.

  Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

     We review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets (other
than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse
changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which
we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see
below). If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying
value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar
assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets
to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

    We evaluate the goodwill, franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on
October 1 and whenever other facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other indefinite-lived

                                                                  II-102

                                               December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


intangible assets may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired.
In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare
the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below
an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). In most cases, our operating segments are deemed to be a reporting unit
either because the operating segment is comprised of only a single component, or the components below the operating segment
are aggregated as they have similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value,
we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to franchise rights or other indefinite-
lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying
value, we then estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the franchise right or other indefinite-
lived intangible asset is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.

  Income Taxes

     Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax basis of assets
and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect
for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits,
that the position will be sustained upon examination. Net deferred tax assets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if we
believe it is more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Certain of our valuation allowances and tax
uncertainties are associated with entities that we acquired in business combinations. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax liabilities related to
investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration are not recognized
until it becomes apparent that such amounts will reverse in the foreseeable future. Interest and penalties related to income tax
liabilities are included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. For additional information on our
income taxes, see note 11.

  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

     The reporting currency of our company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign operations generally is the
applicable local currency for each foreign subsidiary and equity method investee. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
(including intercompany balances for which settlement is not anticipated in the foreseeable future) are translated at the spot rate
in effect at the applicable reporting date. With the exception of certain material transactions, the amounts reported in our consolidated
statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized
cumulative translation adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss in our consolidated statements of equity. With the exception of certain material transactions, the cash flows from
our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the applicable period in our consolidated statements of
cash flows. The impacts of material transactions generally are recorded at the applicable spot rates in our consolidated statements
of operations and cash flows. The effect of exchange rates on cash balances held in foreign currencies are separately reported in
our consolidated statements of cash flows.

     Transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are recorded based on exchange
rates at the time such transactions arise. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance
sheets related to these non-functional currency transactions result in transaction gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated
statements of operations as unrealized (based on the applicable period end exchange rates) or realized upon settlement of the
transactions.

  Revenue Recognition

     Service Revenue — Cable Networks. We recognize revenue from the provision of video, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services over our cable network to customers in the period the related services are provided. Installation revenue
(including reconnect fees) related to services provided over our cable network is recognized as revenue in the period during which
the installation occurs to the extent these fees are equal to or less than direct selling costs, which costs are expensed as incurred.
To the extent installation revenue exceeds direct selling costs, the excess revenue is deferred and amortized over the average
expected subscriber life.

     Sale of Multiple Products and Services. We sell video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile
services to our customers in bundled packages at a rate lower than if the customer purchased each product on a standalone basis.
Revenue from bundled packages generally is allocated proportionally to the individual services based on the relative standalone
price for each respective service.

      Mobile Revenue — General. Arrangement consideration from mobile contracts is allocated to the airtime service element and
the handset service element based on the relative standalone prices of each element. The amount of arrangement consideration
allocated to the handset is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of future airtime services. Certain of our
operations that provide mobile services offer handsets under a subsidized contract model, whereby upfront revenue recognition
is limited to the upfront cash collected from the customer as the remaining monthly fees to be received from the customer, including
fees that may be associated with the handset, are contingent upon delivering future airtime services. At certain of our operations,
mobile customers may choose to enter into two distinct contractual relationships: (i) a mobile handset contract and (ii) a mobile
airtime services contract (a Split-contract Program). Under the mobile handset contract, the customer takes full title to the handset
upon delivery and typically has the option to either (a) pay for the handset in cash upon delivery or (b) pay for the handset in
installments over a contractual period. Under these arrangements, the handset installment payments are not contingent upon
delivering future airtime services and the arrangement consideration allocated to the handset is not limited to the upfront cash
collected.

     Mobile Revenue — Airtime Services. We recognize revenue from mobile services in the period the related services are provided.
Revenue from pre-pay customers is recorded as deferred revenue prior to the commencement of services and revenue is recognized
as the services are rendered or usage rights expire.

     Mobile Revenue — Handset Revenue. Arrangement consideration allocated to handsets is recognized as revenue when the
goods have been delivered and title has passed. For customers under a mobile handset installment contract that is independent of
a mobile airtime services contract, revenue is recognized upon delivery only if collectibility is reasonably assured. Our assessment
of collectibility is based principally on internal and external credit assessments as well as historical collection information for
similar customers. To the extent that collectibility of installment payments from the customer is not reasonably assured upon
delivery of the handset, handset revenue is recognized on a cash basis as customer payments are received.

    Business-to-Business (B2B) Revenue. We defer upfront installation and certain nonrecurring fees received on B2B contracts
where we maintain ownership of the installed equipment. The deferred fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis
over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance.

     Promotional Discounts. For subscriber promotions, such as discounted or free services during an introductory period, revenue
is recognized only to the extent of the discounted monthly fees charged to the subscriber, if any.

    Subscriber Advance Payments and Deposits. Payments received in advance for the services we provide are deferred and
recognized as revenue when the associated services are provided.

    Sales, Use and Other Value-Added Taxes (VAT). Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales, use and other value-added taxes.

  Share-Based Compensation

    We recognize all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee share incentive awards, based on their
grant date fair values and our estimates of forfeitures. We recognize the grant date fair value of outstanding awards as a charge to
operations over the vesting period. The cash benefits of tax deductions in excess of deferred taxes on recognized share-based

                                                               II-104
                                                           LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC

                                                       December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow. Payroll taxes incurred in connection with the vesting or exercise of
our share-based incentive awards are recorded as a component of share-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements
of operations.

    We use the straight-line method to recognize share-based compensation expense for our outstanding share awards that do not
contain a performance condition and the accelerated expense attribution method for our outstanding share awards that contain a
performance condition and vest on a graded basis.

     We have calculated the expected life of options and share appreciation rights (SARs) granted by Liberty Global to employees
based on historical exercise trends. The expected volatility for Liberty Global options and SARs is generally based on a combination
of (i) historical volatilities of Liberty Global ordinary shares for a period equal to the expected average life of the Liberty Global
awards and (ii) volatilities implied from publicly-traded Liberty Global options.

     Under U.K. corporate law, we are required to issue new shares of Liberty Global ordinary shares when Liberty Global options
or SARs are exercised and when restricted share units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted share units (PSUs) vest. Although
we repurchase Liberty Global ordinary shares from time to time, the parameters of our share purchase and redemption activities
are not established solely with reference to the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation plans.

      For additional information regarding our share-based compensation, see note 13.

  Litigation Costs

      Legal fees and related litigation costs are expensed as incurred.

  Earnings or Loss per Share

     Basic earnings or loss per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the weighted average number of shares
(excluding restricted shares) outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings or loss per share presents the dilutive effect, if any, on
a per share basis of potential shares (e.g., options, SARs, performance-based share appreciation rights (PSARs), restricted shares,
RSUs and convertible securities) as if they had been exercised, vested or converted at the beginning of the periods presented.

     Liberty Global Shares. We reported a loss from continuing operations attributable to holders of Liberty Global Shares for the
period from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Therefore, the potentially dilutive effect at December 31, 2015 of the
following items was not included in the computation of diluted loss per share attributable to holders of Liberty Global Shares
because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the computation or, in the case of certain PSUs and Performance Grant
Units (PGUs), because such awards had not yet met the applicable performance criteria: (i) the aggregate number of shares issuable
pursuant to outstanding options, SARs, PSARs and RSUs of approximately 43.3 million, (ii) the aggregate number of shares
issuable pursuant to PSUs and PGUs of approximately 4.5 million and (iii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to
obligations that may be settled in cash or shares of approximately 2.7 million.

   LiLAC Shares. The details of the calculation of EPS with respect to LiLAC Shares for the period from July 1, 2015 through
December 31, 2015 are set forth in the following table:

Numerator:
 Net earnings attributable to holders of LiLAC Shares (basic and diluted EPS computation) (in millions) ...... $                                             17.2

    release of share units upon vesting (treasury stock method) ........................................................................                  319,518
 Weighted average ordinary shares (diluted EPS computation)..........................................................................                  44,235,275

    A total of 0.7 million options, SARs, PSARs and RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share
during the period from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

     Old Liberty Global Shares. We reported losses from continuing operations attributable to holders of Old Liberty Global Shares
for the period from January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Therefore, the
potentially dilutive effect at June 30, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 of the following items was not included
in the computation of diluted loss per share attributable to holders of Old Liberty Global Shares because their inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive to the computation or, in the case of certain PSUs and PGUs, because such awards had not yet met the
applicable performance criteria: (i) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options, SARs, PSARs and
restricted shares and RSUs of approximately 42.1 million, 39.1 million and 40.3 million, respectively, (ii) the aggregate number
of shares issuable pursuant to PSUs and PGUs of approximately 5.3 million, 5.4 million and 3.7 million, respectively, and (iii)
the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to obligations that may be settled in cash or shares of approximately 2.6 million
for each of the respective dates.

(4)       Acquisitions

  Pending 2016 Acquisition

     CWC. On November 16, 2015, we announced, pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the
terms of a recommended acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC) for
shares of Liberty Global in a scheme of arrangement. Under the terms of the transaction, CWC shareholders will be entitled to
receive up to, in the aggregate: 31,651,616 Class A Liberty Global Shares, 77,488,978 Class C Liberty Global Shares, 3,648,524
Class A LiLAC Shares and 8,939,328 Class C LiLAC Shares. Further, CWC shareholders would be entitled to receive a special
dividend in the amount of £0.03 ($0.04) per CWC share at the closing of the transaction, which would be in lieu of any previously-
announced CWC dividend. We expect that the dividend and estimated fees and expenses will be funded from CWC liquidity,
including incremental debt borrowings, and LiLAC Group liquidity. Completion of the acquisition, which is expected to occur
during the second quarter of 2016, is subject to, among other conditions, Liberty Global and CWC shareholder approvals, certain
regulatory approvals and court sanction of the scheme of arrangement. In connection with the proposed acquisition, we entered
into an agreement with CWC to, among other things, provide our reasonable co-operation to CWC to complete the acquisition.
If the acquisition of CWC is not completed as expected, under certain limited circumstances, we could be required to pay CWC
a termination fee of $50 million.

     Following completion of the acquisition of CWC, we intend to attribute CWC to the LiLAC Group, with the Liberty Global
Group being granted an inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group. Based on the fully-diluted numbers of Liberty Global Shares,
LiLAC Shares and CWC shares outstanding on November 16, 2015, after giving effect to the acquisition and such attribution,
and treating the Liberty Global Group’s inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group as being represented by additional LiLAC Shares,
Liberty Global Group shareholders would have had an approximate 67.4% ownership interest in the LiLAC Group.

      For information regarding an acquisition we completed subsequent to December 31, 2015, see note 20.

  2015 Acquisition

     On June 3, 2015, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with the parent of Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Company Inc.,
dba Choice Cable TV (Choice) and following regulatory approval, one of our subsidiaries, together with investment funds affiliated
with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, Searchlight), acquired 100% of Choice (the Choice Acquisition). Choice is
a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico. We acquired Choice in order to achieve certain financial, operational and
strategic benefits through the integration of Choice with Liberty Puerto Rico. The combined business is 60.0%-owned by our
company and 40.0%-owned by Searchlight.

     The purchase price for Choice of $276.4 million was funded through (i) Liberty Puerto Rico’s incremental debt borrowings,
net of discount and fees, of $259.1 million, (ii) cash of $10.5 million and (iii) an equity contribution from Searchlight of $6.8
million.




                                                             II-107
                                                               LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                               Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                           December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


     We have accounted for the Choice Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price
was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of Choice based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of the purchase
price and the preliminary opening balance sheet for the Choice Acquisition at the June 3, 2015 acquisition date is presented in the
following table. The preliminary opening balance sheet is subject to adjustment based on our final assessment of the fair values
of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities. Although most items in the valuation process remain open, the items with the
highest likelihood of changing upon finalization of the valuation process include property and equipment, goodwill, intangible
assets associated with franchise rights and customer relationships and income taxes (in millions):

Cash and cash equivalents.................................................................................................................................... $            3.6
Other current assets ..............................................................................................................................................        7.8
Property and equipment, net.................................................................................................................................              79.8
Goodwill (a) .........................................................................................................................................................    51.6
Intangible assets subject to amortization, net (b) .................................................................................................                      59.1
Franchise rights ....................................................................................................................................................    147.8
Other assets, net....................................................................................................................................................      0.3
Other accrued and current liabilities ....................................................................................................................               (13.2)
Non-current deferred tax liabilities ......................................................................................................................              (60.4)
    Total purchase price (c)................................................................................................................................... $        276.4
_______________

(a)     The goodwill recognized in connection with the Choice Acquisition is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take advantage
        of Choice’s existing advanced broadband communications network to gain immediate access to potential customers and
        (ii) synergies that are expected to be achieved through the integration of Choice with Liberty Puerto Rico. The entire amount
        of goodwill is expected to be deductible for U.S. tax purposes.

(b)     Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. As of June 3, 2015, the weighted average
        useful life of Choice’s intangible assets was approximately ten years.

(c)     Excludes direct acquisition costs of $8.5 million incurred through December 31, 2015, which are included in impairment,
        restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statement of operations.

  2014 Acquisition

     On November 11, 2014 (the Ziggo Acquisition Date), pursuant to a merger protocol (the Ziggo Merger Protocol) with
respect to an offer to acquire all of the shares of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo) that we did not already own (the Ziggo Offer), we
gained control of Ziggo through the acquisition of 136,603,794 additional Ziggo shares, which increased our ownership interest
in Ziggo to 88.9% (the Ziggo Acquisition). From November 12, 2014 through November 19, 2014, we acquired 18,998,057
additional Ziggo shares, further increasing our ownership interest in Ziggo to 98.4% (the Ziggo NCI Acquisition). Ziggo is a
provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands. We acquired Ziggo in order
to achieve certain financial, operational and strategic benefits through the integration of Ziggo with with our existing operations
in the Netherlands and our other European operations.

     Pursuant to the Ziggo Merger Protocol, Ziggo shareholders who tendered their Ziggo shares received an offer price of (i)
0.2282 Class A Old Liberty Global Shares, (ii) 0.5630 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (iii) €11.00 ($13.71 at the applicable
rates) in cash for each Ziggo share that they tendered. In connection with the completion of the Ziggo Acquisition and the Ziggo
NCI Acquisition, we (a) issued an aggregate of 35,508,342 Class A and 87,603,842 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (b)
paid aggregate cash consideration of €1,711.6 million ($2,133.6 million at the applicable rates) to holders of Ziggo ordinary shares.

    On December 3, 2014, we initiated a statutory squeeze-out procedure in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code (the Statutory
Squeeze-out) in order to acquire the remaining 3,162,605 Ziggo shares not tendered through November 19, 2014. Under the
Statutory Squeeze-out, which was completed during the second quarter of 2015, Ziggo shareholders other than Liberty Global


                                                                                         II-108
                                                                LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                                Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                            December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


received cash consideration of €39.78 ($44.91 at the applicable rates) per share, plus interest, for an aggregate of €125.9 million
($142.2 million at the applicable rates). This amount was approved in April 2015 by the Enterprise Court in the Netherlands.

   For accounting purposes, (i) the Ziggo Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of Ziggo by Liberty Global and (ii) the Ziggo
NCI Acquisition and the Statutory Squeeze-out were treated as the acquisitions of a noncontrolling interest.

    In connection with the completion of the Ziggo Acquisition, we obtained regulatory clearance from the European Commission
on October 10, 2014, subject to the following commitments:

      •     our commitment to divest our Film1 channels to a third party and to carry Film1 on our network in the Netherlands for
            a period of three years. Accordingly, on July 21, 2015, we sold our Film1 channels to Sony Pictures Television Networks.
            Under the terms of the agreement, all five Film1 channels will continue to be carried on certain of our networks for a
            period of at least three years; and

      •     our commitment for a period of eight years with respect to our network in the Netherlands (i) not to enforce certain clauses
            currently contained in carriage agreements with broadcasters that restrict the ability of broadcasters to offer their channels
            and content via over-the-top services, (ii) not to enter into carriage agreements containing such clauses and (iii) to maintain
            adequate interconnection capacity through at least three uncongested routes into our network in the Netherlands, at least
            one of which must be with a large transit provider.

     In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator filed an appeal against the European Commission regarding
its decision to approve the Ziggo Acquisition. We are not a party to the appeal and we do not expect that the filing of this appeal
will have any impact on the ongoing integration and development of our operations in the Netherlands.

    For accounting purposes, the Ziggo Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of Ziggo by Liberty Global. In this regard, the
equity and cash consideration paid to acquire Ziggo plus the fair value of our pre-existing investment in Ziggo on the Ziggo
Acquisition Date is set forth below (in millions):

Class A Old Liberty Global Shares (a)................................................................................................................... $                      1,448.7
Class C Old Liberty Global Shares (a)...................................................................................................................                        3,457.1
Cash (b) ..................................................................................................................................................................     1,872.9
Fair value of pre-existing investment in Ziggo (c).................................................................................................                             2,015.4
   Total................................................................................................................................................................... $   8,794.1

          shareholders in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition through the Ziggo Acquisition Date. These amounts are based on
          (i) the exchange ratios specified by the Ziggo Merger Protocol, (ii) the applicable closing per share prices of Class A and
          Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (iii) 136,603,794 ordinary shares of Ziggo tendered in the Ziggo Offer through the
          Ziggo Acquisition Date.

     We have accounted for the Ziggo Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price
was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of Ziggo based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of the purchase
price and the preliminary opening balance sheet for the Ziggo Acquisition as of the Ziggo Acquisition Date is presented in the
following table. The opening balance sheet presented below reflects our final purchase price allocation (in millions):

Cash and cash equivalents (a) .............................................................................................................................. $           1,889.7

    Total purchase price (e)................................................................................................................................... $        8,794.1
_______________

(a)      The Ziggo Acquisition resulted in $16.8 million of net cash acquired after deducting the cash consideration paid.

(b)      The goodwill recognized in connection with the Ziggo Acquisition is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take advantage
         of Ziggo’s existing advanced broadband communications network to gain immediate access to potential customers and
         (ii) synergies that are expected to be achieved through the integration of Ziggo with our existing operations in the Netherlands
         and our other European operations.

(c)      Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. As of the Ziggo Acquisition Date, the weighted
         average useful life of Ziggo’s intangible assets was approximately ten years.

(d)      Represents the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in Ziggo as of the Ziggo Acquisition Date.

  2013 Acquisition

     On June 7, 2013, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Virgin Media Merger Agreement) with Virgin Media
and following receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals, we acquired Virgin Media in a stock and cash merger (the Virgin
Media Acquisition). Virgin Media is one of the U.K.’s largest providers of residential video, broadband internet, fixed-line
telephony and mobile services in terms of number of customers. We acquired Virgin Media in order to achieve certain financial,
operational and strategic benefits through the integration of Virgin Media with our existing European operations.

      Pursuant to the Virgin Media Merger Agreement:

      •     Each share of common stock of Virgin Media was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.2582 Class A Old Liberty
            Global Shares, (ii) 0.6438 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares and (iii) $17.50 in cash; and

      •     Each share of Series A common stock of LGI was converted into the right to receive one Class A Old Liberty Global
            Share; each share of Series B common stock of LGI was converted into the right to receive one Class B Old Liberty
            Global Share; and each share of Series C common stock of LGI was converted into the right to receive one Class C Old
            Liberty Global Share.

    In connection with the completion of the Virgin Media Acquisition, we issued 70,233,842 Class A and 175,122,182 Class C
Old Liberty Global Shares to holders of Virgin Media common stock and 141,234,331 Class A, 10,176,295 Class B and 362,556,220
Class C Old Liberty Global Shares to holders of LGI Series A, Series B and Series C common stock, respectively.

      In connection with the execution of the Virgin Media Merger Agreement, we entered into various debt financing arrangements.

    In a transaction that did not impact our cash and cash equivalents, the net proceeds (after deducting certain transaction expenses)
from the February 2013 issuance of the April 2021 VM Senior Secured Notes and 2023 VM Senior Notes (each as defined and
described in note 10) of $3,557.5 million (equivalent at the transaction date) were placed into segregated escrow accounts (the
Virgin Media Escrow Accounts) with a trustee. Such net proceeds were released in connection with the closing of the Virgin
Media Acquisition.

     The Virgin Media Acquisition and related refinancing transactions were funded with a combination of (i) the proceeds from
the Virgin Media Escrow Accounts, (ii) borrowings under the VM Credit Facility (as defined and described in note 10) and (iii)
our and Virgin Media’s existing liquidity.

     For accounting purposes, the Virgin Media Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of Virgin Media by Liberty Global (as
the successor to LGI). In this regard, the equity and cash consideration paid to acquire Virgin Media is set forth below (in millions):

Class A Old Liberty Global Shares (a)................................................................................................................. $                     2,735.0
Class C Old Liberty Global Shares (a).................................................................................................................                       6,369.9
Cash (b) ................................................................................................................................................................    4,760.2
Fair value of the vested portion of Virgin Media stock incentive awards (c)......................................................                                              270.4
   Total equity and cash consideration................................................................................................................. $                   14,135.5
_______________

(a)       Represents the value assigned to the 70,233,842 Class A and 175,122,182 Class C Old Liberty Global Shares issued to
          Virgin Media shareholders in connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition. These amounts are based on (i) the exchange
          ratios specified by the Virgin Media Merger Agreement, (ii) the closing per share price on June 7, 2013 of Series A and
          Series C LGI common stock of $38.94 and $36.37, respectively, and (iii) the 272,013,333 outstanding shares of Virgin
          Media common stock at June 7, 2013.



                                                                                           II-111

                                               Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                           December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


(b)     Represents the cash consideration paid in connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition. This amount is based on (i) the
        $17.50 per share cash consideration specified by the Virgin Media Merger Agreement and (ii) the 272,013,333 outstanding
        shares of Virgin Media common stock at June 7, 2013.

(c)     Represents the portion of the estimated fair value of the Virgin Media stock incentive awards that are attributable to services
        provided prior to the June 7, 2013 acquisition date. The estimated fair value is based on the attributes of the 13.03 million
        outstanding Virgin Media stock incentive awards at June 7, 2013, including the market price of the underlying Virgin Media
        common stock. The outstanding Virgin Media stock incentive awards at June 7, 2013 include 9.86 million stock options
        that have been valued using Black Scholes option valuations. In addition, Virgin Media’s stock incentive awards at June 7,
        2013 included 3.17 million restricted stock units that included performance conditions and, in certain cases, market
        conditions. Those restricted stock units with market conditions have been valued using Monte Carlo simulation models.

     We have accounted for the acquisition of Virgin Media using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase
price was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of Virgin Media based on assessments of their respective fair values,
and the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of
the purchase price and opening balance sheet for the Virgin Media Acquisition at the June 7, 2013 acquisition date is presented in
the following table. The opening balance sheet presented below reflects our final purchase price allocation (in millions):

Cash and cash equivalents.................................................................................................................................... $             694.6
Other current assets ..............................................................................................................................................         932.2
Property and equipment, net.................................................................................................................................              9,863.1
Goodwill (a) .........................................................................................................................................................    9,000.8
Intangible assets subject to amortization (b) ........................................................................................................                    3,925.8
Other assets, net....................................................................................................................................................     4,259.4
Current portion of debt and capital lease obligations...........................................................................................                         (1,184.5)
Other accrued and current liabilities (c) (d) .........................................................................................................                  (1,892.2)
Long-term debt and capital lease obligations.......................................................................................................                      (8,477.4)
Other long-term liabilities (c)...............................................................................................................................           (1,326.3)
Additional paid-in capital (e) ...............................................................................................................................           (1,660.0)
    Total purchase price (f)................................................................................................................................... $        14,135.5
_______________

(a)     The goodwill recognized in connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take
        advantage of Virgin Media’s existing advanced broadband communications network to gain immediate access to potential
        customers and (ii) synergies that were expected to be achieved through the integration of Virgin Media with our other
        broadband communications operations in Europe.

(b)     Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. At June 7, 2013, the weighted average useful
        life of Virgin Media’s intangible assets was approximately seven years.

(c)     No amounts were allocated to deferred revenue with respect to the then ongoing performance obligations associated with
        Virgin Media’s B2B service contracts, as the remaining fees to be received under these contracts approximated fair value
        given our estimates of the costs associated with these performance obligations.

(d)     Amount includes a $35.6 million liability that was recorded to adjust an unfavorable capacity contract to its estimated fair
        value. This amount was amortized through the March 31, 2014 expiration date of the contract as a reduction of Virgin
        Media’s operating expenses so that the net effect of this amortization and the payments required under the contract
        approximated market rates. During the period from June 8, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended
        December 31, 2014, $22.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of this liability was amortized as a reduction of operating
        expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.

(e)      Represents the equity component of the 6.50% convertible senior notes (the VM Convertible Notes). During the period
         from June 7, 2013 through December 31, 2013, 94.4% of the VM Convertible Notes were exchanged for Class A and Class
         C Old Liberty Global Shares and cash pursuant to the terms of the indenture underlying the VM Convertible Notes.

(f)      Excludes direct acquisition costs of $51.5 million incurred through December 31, 2014, which are included in impairment,
         restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.

  Pro Forma Information

     The following unaudited pro forma consolidated operating results give effect to (i) the acquisition of 100% of Ziggo and (ii)
the Choice Acquisition, as if they had been completed as of January 1, 2014. These pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on such date. The pro forma adjustments are
based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. In the following table, we present the revenue that is attributed to
the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group as if such revenue had been attributed to each group at the beginning of each
period presented. However, our presentation of net earnings (loss) and basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributed to (a)
Liberty Global Shares, (b) LiLAC Shares and (c) Old Liberty Global Shares only includes the results of operations for the periods
during which these shares were outstanding. Accordingly, (1) our net earnings (loss) attributed to Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC
Shares relates to the period from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and (2) our net loss attributed to Old Liberty Global
Shares relates to periods prior to July 1, 2015.

    Our consolidated statement of operations for 2014 includes revenue and net loss of $272.0 million and $98.7 million,
respectively, attributable to Ziggo.

(5)         Discontinued Operation

     On January 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the Chellomedia Disposal Group to AMC Networks Inc. for €750.0 million
($1,013.1 million at the applicable rate) in cash. Accordingly, the Chellomedia Disposal Group is reflected as a discontinued
operation in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for 2014 and 2013. The assets disposed of pursuant to the
Chellomedia Transaction exclude Chellomedia’s premium sports and film channels in the Netherlands. In connection with the sale
of the Chellomedia Disposal Group, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $342.2 million. This pre-tax gain is net of a $64.0 million
cumulative foreign currency translation loss, which was reclassified to net loss from accumulated other comprehensive earnings.
The associated income tax expense of $9.5 million differs from the amount computed by applying the U.K. statutory income tax
rate in effect at the time of 21.5% primarily due to the fact that (i) the transaction was not subject to taxation in the U.K. and (ii)
most elements of the transaction were not subject to taxation in the Netherlands or the U.S. The net after-tax gain of $332.7 million
is included in gain on disposal of discontinued operation, net of taxes, in our consolidated statement of operations.

     Certain of our broadband communications operations will continue to receive programming services from the Chellomedia
Disposal Group through contracts that were negotiated as part of the disposal. As such, Liberty Global will have continuing cash
outflows associated with the Chellomedia Disposal Group through at least 2017. However, our involvement as an ongoing customer
of the Chellomedia Disposal Group does not disqualify discontinued operations classification because (i) the ongoing cash outflows
are not considered significant to the Chellomedia Disposal Group and (ii) Liberty Global does not possess any rights within the

  Fair Value Investments

     ITV. On July 17, 2014, we acquired an aggregate of 259,820,065 shares of ITV plc (ITV), a commercial broadcaster in the
U.K., at a price of £1.85 ($3.14 at the transaction date) per share, for an investment of £480.7 million ($816.3 million at the
transaction date) (the Initial ITV Investment). On July 30, 2015, we acquired an additional 138,695,445 shares of ITV at a per
share price of £2.716 ($4.23 at the transaction date), for an additional investment of £376.7 million ($587.0 million at the transaction
date) (the Additional ITV Investment), which together with the Initial ITV Investment constitutes our total investment in ITV
(the Total ITV Investment). The aggregate purchase price paid to acquire the Total ITV Investment was financed through
borrowings under secured borrowing arrangements (the ITV Collar Loan). The Total ITV Investment comprises 398,515,510
shares, or approximately 9.9% of the total outstanding shares of ITV as of June 30, 2015, the most current publicly-available
information. All of the ITV shares we hold are subject to a share collar (the ITV Collar) and pledged as collateral under the ITV
Collar Loan. Under the terms of the ITV Collar, the counterparty has the right to re-use all of the pledged ITV shares. For additional
information regarding the ITV Collar, see note 7.

    Sumitomo. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we owned 45,652,043 shares of Sumitomo Corporation (Sumitomo) common
stock. Our Sumitomo shares represented less than 5% of Sumitomo’s outstanding common stock at December 31, 2015. These
shares secure the Sumitomo Collar Loan, as defined and described in note 7.

     Lionsgate. On November 12, 2015, we acquired an aggregate of 5.0 million shares of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.
(Lionsgate), at a price of $39.02 per share, for an investment of $195.1 million. The aggregate purchase price of the Lionsgate
shares was financed using working capital, including $70.9 million of cash received pursuant to a variable prepaid forward
transaction with respect to 2.5 million Lionsgate shares (the Lionsgate Forward). The Lionsgate Forward has economic
characteristics similar to a collar plus a loan that is collateralized by a pledge of the aforementioned 2.5 million shares (the Lionsgate
Loan). Under the terms of the Lionsgate Forward, the counterparty does not have the right to re-use the pledged Lionsgate shares
without permission from Liberty Global. In connection with our acquisition of the Lionsgate shares, we also agreed, among other
things and subject to certain exceptions, not to sell or transfer any of our Lionsgate shares (other than pursuant to the Lionsgate
Forward) until November 2016. Our Lionsgate shares represented less than 5% of the total outstanding shares of Lionsgate as of
the acquisition date. For additional information regarding the Lionsgate Forward, see note 7.

   ITI Neovision. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we owned a 17.0% interest in ITI Neovision S.A. (ITI Neovision) (formerly
Canal+ Cyfrowy S.A.), a privately-held direct-to-home (DTH) operator in Poland.

  Equity Method Investments

     All3Media. As of December 31, 2015, our most significant equity method investment is our investment in All3Media Holdings
Limited (All3Media), an independent television, film and digital production and distribution company in the U.K. Our investment
in All3Media is held through our 50.0% interest in DLG Acquisition Limited (DLG), a joint venture between one of our subsidiaries
and a subsidiary of Discovery Communications, Inc. (Discovery). In September 2014, we and a subsidiary of Discovery each
contributed £90.0 million ($147.2 million at the transaction date) to DLG in connection with DLG’s acquisition of 100% of
All3Media. The December 31, 2015 carrying value of our investment in DLG, including a loan to DLG, was $132.1 million.

(7)      Derivative Instruments

     In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against (i) increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate
debt and (ii) foreign currency movements, particularly with respect to borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency of the borrowing entity. In this regard, through our subsidiaries, we have entered into various derivative
instruments to manage interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure with respect to the U.S. dollar ($), the euro (€), the
British pound sterling (£), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Chilean peso (CLP), the Czech koruna (CZK), the Hungarian forint (HUF),
the Polish zloty (PLN) and the Romanian lei (RON). With the exception of a limited number of our foreign currency forward
contracts, we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of most of our
derivative instruments are recorded in realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, net, in our consolidated
statements of operations.

(b)      We consider credit risk in our fair value assessments. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, (i) the fair values of our cross-
         currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented assets have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments
         aggregating $64.0 million and $30.9 million, respectively, and (ii) the fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate
         derivative contracts that represented liabilities have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating
         $86.5 million and $64.6 million, respectively. The adjustments to our derivative assets relate to the credit risk associated
         with counterparty nonperformance, and the adjustments to our derivative liabilities relate to credit risk associated with our
         own nonperformance. In all cases, the adjustments take into account offsetting liability or asset positions within a given
         contract. Our determination of credit risk valuation adjustments generally is based on our and our counterparties’ credit risks,
         as observed in the credit default swap market and market quotations for certain of our subsidiaries’ debt instruments, as
         applicable. The changes in the credit risk valuation adjustments associated with our cross-currency and interest rate derivative
         contracts resulted in net gains (losses) of ($9.3 million), ($120.9 million) and $15.3 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013,
         respectively. These amounts are included in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, in our
         consolidated statements of operations. For further information regarding our fair value measurements, see note 8.

(c)      Our equity-related derivative instruments include the fair value of (i) the ITV Collar, (ii) the share collar (the Sumitomo
         Collar) with respect to the shares of Sumitomo Corporation held by our company, (iii) the Lionsgate Forward (at December
         31, 2015 only), and (iv) the Virgin Media Capped Calls (as defined and described below). The fair values of the ITV Collar,
         the Sumitomo Collar and the Lionsgate Forward, each as further described below, do not include credit risk valuation
         adjustments as we assume that any losses incurred by our company in the event of nonperformance by the respective
         counterparty would be, subject to relevant insolvency laws, fully offset against amounts we owe to such counterparty pursuant
         to the related secured borrowing arrangements.

     The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or financing activity
in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument and the classification of the applicable
underlying cash flows. For foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge capital expenditures, the net cash received or
paid is classified as an adjustment to capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For derivative contracts that
are terminated prior to maturity, the cash paid or received upon termination that relates to future periods is classified as a financing
activity. The classification of these net cash inflows (outflows) is as follows:

  Counterparty Credit Risk

    We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default
on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and
concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is
spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. Collateral is generally not posted by either
party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. At December 31, 2015, our exposure to counterparty
credit risk included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of $2,025.2 million.

     Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each
counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such
derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative
instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar
arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups.

      Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination
payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly,
it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially
or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though
it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so
                                                                                          II-119

will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured
creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we
have obtained from that counterparty.

     In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may
be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without
any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty
or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

Details of our Derivative Instruments

     In the following tables, we present the details of the various categories of our subsidiaries’ derivative instruments. For each
subsidiary with multiple derivative instruments that mature within the same calendar month, the notional amounts are shown in the
aggregate, and interest rates are presented on a weighted average basis. In addition, for derivative instruments that were in effect
as of December 31, 2015, we present a single date that represents the applicable final maturity date. For derivative instruments that
become effective subsequent to December 31, 2015, we present a range of dates that represents the period covered by the applicable
derivative instruments.

  Equity-related Derivative Instruments

     ITV Collar and Secured Borrowing. The ITV Collar is comprised of (i) purchased put options exercisable by Liberty Global
Incorporated Limited (Liberty Global Limited), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and (ii) written call options exercisable by the
counterparty. The ITV Collar effectively hedges the value of our investment in ITV shares from losses due to market price decreases
below the put option price while retaining a portion of the gains from market price increases up to the call option price. For additional
information regarding our investment in ITV, see note 6.

     The ITV Collar and related agreements also provided Liberty Global Limited with the ability to effectively finance the purchase
of its ITV shares pursuant to the ITV Collar Loan. In July 2014 and in connection with the Initial ITV Investment, Liberty Global
Limited borrowed £446.9 million ($764.5 million at the transaction date) under the ITV Collar Loan. In July 2015 and in connection
with the Additional ITV Investment, Liberty Global Limited (i) modified the purchased put option and written call option strike
prices within the ITV Collar and (ii) increased its borrowings under the ITV Collar Loan, resulting in net cash received of $92.0
million. The amount received in connection with the Additional ITV Investment includes $77.5 million of cash borrowings under
the ITV Collar Loan that were not required to fund the Additional ITV Investment and $14.5 million related to the ITV Collar Loan
modifications. Immediately prior to the completion of these modifications, the fair value of the ITV Collar was a $270.5 million
liability. In connection with the ITV Collar modifications, this liability was effectively transferred on a non-cash basis to the principal
amount of the ITV Collar Loan. At December 31, 2015, borrowings under the ITV Collar Loan were secured by all 398,515,510
of our ITV shares, which have been placed into a custody account. The ITV Collar Loan was issued at a discount with a zero coupon
rate and has an average implied yield of 139 basis points (1.39%). The ITV Collar Loan, which has an average maturity of three
years and contains no financial covenants, provides for customary representations and warranties, events of default and certain
adjustment and termination events. Under the terms of the ITV Collar, the counterparty has the right to re-use the pledged ITV
shares held in the custody account, but we have the right to recall the shares that are re-used by the counterparty subject to certain
costs. In addition, the counterparty retains dividends on the ITV shares that the counterparty would need to borrow from the custody
account to hedge its exposure under the ITV Collar (an estimated 390 million shares at December 31, 2015).

    Sumitomo Collar and Secured Borrowing. The Sumitomo Collar is comprised of purchased put options exercisable by Liberty
Programming Japan LLC (Liberty Programming Japan), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and written call options exercisable by

                                                                                 II-124

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


the counterparty with respect to all of the common shares of Sumitomo owned by Liberty Programming Japan. The Sumitomo
Collar effectively hedges the value of our investment in Sumitomo shares from losses due to market price decreases below a per
share value of ¥2,118.50 ($17.62) while retaining gains from market price increases up to a per share value of ¥2,787.50 ($23.19).
At December 31, 2015, the market price of Sumitomo common stock was ¥1,240.50 ($10.32) per share. The Sumitomo Collar
provides for a projected gross cash ordinary dividend to be paid per Sumitomo share during the term of the Sumitomo Collar. If
the actual dividend paid does not exactly match the projected dividend, then an adjustment amount shall be payable between the
parties to the Sumitomo Collar depending on the dividend actually paid by Sumitomo. The Sumitomo Collar may, at the option of
Liberty Programming Japan, be settled in Sumitomo shares or in cash. The Sumitomo Collar also includes a purchased fair value
put option, which effectively provides Liberty Programming Japan with the ability to sell the Sumitomo shares when the market
price is trading between the put and call strike prices. The Sumitomo Collar matures in five equal semi-annual installments beginning
on May 22, 2016. The fair value of the Sumitomo Collar as of December 31, 2015 was a net asset of $345.6 million, of which
$120.6 million is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet.

     The Sumitomo Collar and related agreements also provide Liberty Programming Japan with the ability to borrow funds on a
secured basis. Borrowings under these agreements, which are secured by a pledge of 100% of the Sumitomo shares owned by
Liberty Programming Japan, bear interest at 1.883% and mature in five equal semi-annual installments beginning on May 22, 2016,
are included in our current and long-term debt and capital lease obligations in our consolidated balance sheets. During 2007, Liberty
Programming Japan borrowed ¥93.660 billion ($757.6 million at the transaction date) under these agreements (the Sumitomo
Collar Loan). The pledge arrangement entered into by Liberty Programming Japan provides that Liberty Programming Japan will
be able to exercise all voting and consensual rights and, subject to the terms of the Sumitomo Collar, receive dividends on the
Sumitomo shares.

     Lionsgate Forward and Secured Borrowing. The Lionsgate Forward has the economic equivalent of (i) purchased put options
exercisable by Liberty Global Limited and (ii) written call options exercisable by the counterparty. The Lionsgate Forward effectively
hedges the value of a portion of our investment in Lionsgate shares from losses due to market price decreases below the put option
price while retaining a portion of the gains from market price increases up to the call option price. For additional information
regarding our investment in Lionsgate, see note 6.

     The Lionsgate Forward and related agreements also provided Liberty Global Limited with the ability to effectively finance a
portion of the purchase of its Lionsgate shares pursuant to the Lionsgate Loan. In November 2015, Liberty Global Limited borrowed
$69.7 million under the Lionsgate Loan. At December 31, 2015, borrowings under the Lionsgate Loan were secured by 2.5 million
of our Lionsgate shares, which have been placed into a custody account. The Lionsgate Loan was issued at a discount with a zero
coupon rate and an average implied yield of 350 basis points (3.5%). The Lionsgate Loan, which has an average maturity of five
years and contains no financial covenants, provides for customary representations and warranties, events of default and certain
adjustment and termination events. Under the terms of the Lionsgate Forward, the counterparty does not have the right to re-use
the pledged Lionsgate shares without permission from Liberty Global. In addition, Liberty Global Limited is obligated to share
with the counterparty the economic benefit of any dividends paid during the term of the pledge based on a formula that takes into
account a theoretical hedging position by the counterparty under the Lionsgate Forward (an estimated 1.7 million shares at
December 31, 2015).

     Ziggo Collar and Secured Borrowing. In July 2013, Liberty Global Limited paid a net option premium of €38.6 million ($51.0
million at the transaction date) to enter into a share collar (the Ziggo Collar) and secured borrowing arrangement (the Ziggo Collar
Loan) with respect to the then owned 24,957,000 Ziggo shares. The Ziggo Collar was comprised of (i) purchased put options
exercisable by Liberty Global Limited and (ii) sold call options exercisable by the counterparty. Prior to the Ziggo Acquisition, the
Ziggo Collar effectively hedged the value of a portion of our investment in Ziggo shares from significant losses due to market price
decreases below the put option price while retaining a portion of the gains from market price increases up to the call option price.

     The Ziggo Collar and related agreements also provided Liberty Global Limited with the ability to effectively finance the
purchase of certain of its Ziggo shares pursuant to the Ziggo Collar Loan. In this regard, in July 2013, we borrowed €617.1 million
($816.4 million at the transaction date) under the Ziggo Collar Loan, including €486.4 million ($643.5 million at the transaction
date) of non-cash borrowings that were used to finance the acquisition of Ziggo shares. Upon completion of the Ziggo Acquisition
(see note 4), the Ziggo Collar was terminated and the Ziggo Collar Loan was settled.

    Virgin Media Capped Calls. During 2010, Virgin Media entered into conversion hedges (the Virgin Media Capped Calls) in
order to offset a portion of the dilutive effects associated with the exchange of certain exchangeable notes of Virgin Media. During

                                                               II-125

(8)        Fair Value Measurements

     We use the fair value method to account for (i) certain of our investments and (ii) our derivative instruments. The reported
fair values of these investments and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2015 likely will not represent the value that will
be paid or received upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of these assets and liabilities. In the case of the investments that
we account for using the fair value method, the values we realize upon disposition will be dependent upon, among other factors,
market conditions and the forecasted financial performance of the investees at the time of any such disposition. With respect to
our derivative instruments, we expect that the values realized generally will be based on market conditions at the time of settlement,
which may occur at the maturity of the derivative instrument or at the time of the repayment or refinancing of the underlying debt
instrument.

     GAAP provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting
entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability. We record transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during
which the transfer occurred. During 2015, no such transfers were made.

    All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures, swap rates and certain of the inputs for our weighted average cost of capital
calculations) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These
inputs, or interpolations or extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves,
forward interest and currency rates and weighted average cost of capital rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market
value assessments from the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal
                                                                               II-126

                                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                               December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


valuations and investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values
of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our internal valuations.

     For our investments in ITV, Sumitomo and Lionsgate, the recurring fair value measurements are based on the quoted closing
price of the respective shares at each reporting date. Accordingly, the valuations of these investments fall under Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy. Our other investments that we account for at fair value are privately-held companies, and therefore, quoted market
prices are unavailable. The valuation technique we use for such investments is a combination of an income approach (discounted
cash flow model based on forecasts) and a market approach (market multiples of similar businesses). With the exception of certain
inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used to value these
investments are based on unobservable inputs derived from our assumptions. Therefore, the valuation of our privately-held
investments falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Any reasonably foreseeable changes in assumed levels of unobservable
inputs for the valuations of our Level 3 investments would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

     The recurring fair value measurement of our equity-related derivative instruments are based on binomial option pricing models,
which require the input of observable and unobservable variables such as exchange-traded equity prices, risk-free interest rates,
dividend yields and forecasted volatilities of the underlying equity securities. The valuations of our equity-related derivative
instruments are based on a combination of Level 1 inputs (exchange traded equity prices), Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures and
swap rates) and Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities). As changes in volatilities could have a significant impact on the overall
valuations, we have determined that these valuations fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For the December 31, 2015
valuation of the ITV Collar, we used estimated volatilities ranging from 25.7% to 27.6%. At December 31, 2015, the valuations
of the Sumitomo Collar, the Virgin Media Capped Calls and the Lionsgate Forward were not significantly impacted by forecasted
volatilities.

     As further described in note 7, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage our interest rate and foreign
currency exchange risk. The recurring fair value measurements of these derivative instruments are determined using discounted
cash flow models. Most of the inputs to these discounted cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable Level 2
data for substantially the full term of these derivative instruments. This observable data includes most interest rate futures and
swap rates, which are retrieved or derived from available market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we
do not otherwise alter this data in performing our valuations. We incorporate a credit risk valuation adjustment in our fair value
measurements to estimate the impact of both our own nonperformance risk and the nonperformance risk of our counterparties.
Our and our counterparties’ credit spreads represent our most significant Level 3 inputs, and these inputs are used to derive the
credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our various interest rate and foreign currency derivative valuations. As we would
not expect changes in our or our counterparties’ credit spreads to have a significant impact on the valuations of these derivative
instruments, we have determined that these valuations fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation
adjustments with respect to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps are quantified and further explained in note 7.

      Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment
assessments and acquisition accounting. These nonrecurring valuations include the valuation of reporting units, customer
relationship intangible assets, property and equipment and the implied value of goodwill. The valuation of private reporting units
is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses. With the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of
capital and discount rate calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used in our discounted cash flow analyses,
such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our assumptions. The valuation of customer relationships is primarily based
on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings methodology requires
us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the customer relationship, considering such factors as estimated customer
life, the revenue expected to be generated over the life of the customer, contributory asset charges, and other factors. Tangible
assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the
same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence. The implied value of goodwill is determined
by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination, with the residual amount allocated to goodwill. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant
unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we performed
nonrecurring valuations for the purpose of determining the acquisition accounting for the Choice Acquisition, the Ziggo Acquisition
and the Virgin Media Acquisition, respectively. We used discount rates of 11.75%, 8.50% and 9.00%, respectively, for our valuations

     Depreciation expense of our continuing operations related to our property and equipment was $4,501.4 million, $4,401.6
million and $3,499.6 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depreciation expense of our discontinued operation related
to our property and equipment was nil during 2015 and 2014 and $11.5 million during 2013.

     At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of property and equipment, net, recorded under capital leases was $1,262.5
million and $1,580.8 million, respectively. Most of these amounts relate to assets included in our distribution systems category.
Depreciation of assets under capital leases of our continuing operations is included in depreciation and amortization in our
consolidated statements of operations.

     During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded non-cash increases related to vendor financing arrangements of $1,481.5 million,
$975.3 million and $573.5 million, respectively, which exclude related VAT of $189.3 million, $114.9 million and $46.0 million,
respectively, that were also financed by our vendors under these arrangements. In addition, during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we
recorded non-cash increases to our property and equipment related to assets acquired under capital leases of $106.1 million, $127.2
million and $143.0 million, respectively.

     Most of our property and equipment is pledged as security under our various debt instruments. For additional information,
see note 10.

     During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $68.7 million to reduce the carrying amount of certain
of Ziggo’s internal-use software assets to zero following our determination that these assets would have no future service potential
for our combined operations in the Netherlands.

     In May 2012, we began offering mobile services in Chile through a combination of our own wireless network and a third-
party wireless access arrangement. During the second quarter of 2013, we began exploring strategic alternatives with respect to
VTR’s mobile operations, including alternatives that involved the use of expanded mobile virtual network operator (MVNO)
arrangements. Effective April 1, 2013, we reduced the useful lives of certain of VTR’s network equipment to reflect our then
expectation that we would enter into a new MVNO arrangement and cease commercial use of VTR’s mobile network during the
fourth quarter of 2013. In September 2013, VTR (i) completed the process of migrating its mobile traffic to a third-party wireless
network pursuant to its existing roaming agreement and (ii) ceased commercial use of its mobile network, which resulted in a
further reduction in the useful lives of the aforementioned network equipment. As a result of these reductions in useful lives, VTR
recognized aggregate incremental depreciation expense of $98.3 million during 2013. In connection with the foregoing, we recorded
restructuring charges totaling $84.9 million during the third and fourth quarters of 2013. These restructuring charges include the
fair value of (a) the remaining payments due under certain tower and real estate operating leases of $71.5 million and (b) certain
other required payments associated with VTR’s mobile network. In December 2013, VTR amended its existing roaming agreement
with an agreement that provides for a full MVNO relationship. For information regarding our restructuring charges, see note 14.

_______________

(a)     Represents enterprise-level goodwill that is allocated to our Puerto Rico segment for purposes of our impairment tests.

     If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive,
regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude
in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent,
other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

     At December 31, 2015 and 2014 and based on exchange rates as of those dates, the accumulated goodwill impairments of
our continuing operations were $186.8 million and $209.7 million, respectively. These amounts represent accumulated impairments
related to our broadband communications operations in Romania, which operations are included within the European Operations
Division’s Central and Eastern Europe segment.

     In December 2013, Telenet’s management determined that it would no longer be able to utilize its spectrum rights as a result
of the conclusion of negotiations with network operators in Belgium and the absence of regulatory alternatives. This resulted in
a triggering event with respect to the intangible asset related to Telenet’s spectrum rights and, after performing an impairment
analysis, Telenet recorded an impairment charge of $73.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2013 to reduce the carrying amount
of this intangible asset to zero.

     Amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite useful lives of our continuing operations was $1,324.4 million,
$1,098.5 million and $776.8 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful
lives of our discontinued operation was nil during 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $17.6 million during 2013. Based on the
amortizable intangible asset balances of our continuing operations at December 31, 2015, we expect that amortization expense
will be as follows for the next five years and thereafter. The U.S. dollar equivalents of such amortization expense amounts as of
December 31, 2015 are presented below (in millions):

    At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the franchise rights of Liberty Puerto Rico and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
aggregating $690.5 million and $557.0 million, respectively, were included in other assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.

_______________

(a)   Represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2015 for all borrowings outstanding pursuant to
      each debt instrument, including any applicable margin. The interest rates presented represent stated rates and do not include
      the impact of derivative instruments, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees,
      all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums
      or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs, our weighted average interest rate on our
      aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness was 4.9% (including 4.8% for the Liberty Global Group and 6.0% for the
      LiLAC Group) at December 31, 2015. For information regarding our derivative instruments, see note 7.

(b)   Unused borrowing capacity represents the maximum availability under the applicable facility at December 31, 2015 without
      regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. At December 31, 2015, based on
      the applicable leverage covenants, the full amount of unused borrowing capacity was available to be borrowed under each
      of the respective subsidiary facilities and there were no restrictions on the respective subsidiary's ability to make loans or
      distributions to other Liberty Global subsidiaries or Liberty Global, except as shown in the table below. In the following
      table, for each facility that is subject to limitations on borrowing availability, we present the actual borrowing availability
      under the respective facility and, for each subsidiary where the ability to make loans or distributions is limited, we present
      the amount that can be loaned or distributed to other Liberty Global subsidiaries or to Liberty Global. The amounts presented
      below assume no changes from December 31, 2015 borrowing levels and are based on the applicable covenant and other
      limitations in effect within each borrowing group at December 31, 2015, both before and after considering the impact of
      the completion of the December 31, 2015 compliance requirements.

                                                                                                                   Limitation on availability

  General Information

    At December 31, 2015, all of our outstanding debt had been incurred by one of our seven "borrowing groups." These borrowing
groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within Virgin Media, Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia,
UPC Holding, Telenet, VTR Finance and Liberty Puerto Rico.

     Credit Facilities. Each of our borrowing groups has entered into one or more credit facility agreements with certain financial
institutions. Each of these credit facilities contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

    •    Our credit facilities contain certain consolidated net leverage ratios, as specified in the relevant credit facility, which are
         required to be complied with on an incurrence and/or maintenance basis;

    •    Our credit facilities contain certain restrictions which, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the
         relevant borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and
         acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets, in each case, subject to certain customary and agreed
         exceptions and (iv) make certain restricted payments to their direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to
         Liberty Global) through dividends, loans or other distributions, subject to compliance with applicable covenants;

    •    Our credit facilities require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums
         payable under the relevant credit facility and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their
         shares or, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable
         thereunder;

    •    In addition to certain mandatory prepayment events, the instructing group of lenders under the relevant credit facility
         may cancel the commitments thereunder and declare the loans thereunder due and payable after the applicable notice
         period following the occurrence of a change of control (as specified in the relevant credit facility);

    •    Our credit facilities contain certain customary events of default, the occurrence of which, subject to certain exceptions
         and materiality qualifications, would allow the instructing group of lenders to (i) cancel the total commitments, (ii)
         accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments thereunder and/or (iii) declare that all or part of the
         loans be payable on demand;

    •    Our credit facilities require members of the relevant borrowing group to observe certain affirmative and negative
         undertakings and covenants, which are subject to certain materiality qualifications and other customary and agreed
         exceptions; and

    •    In addition to customary default provisions, our credit facilities generally include certain cross-default and cross-
         acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness of members of the relevant borrowing group, subject to agreed
         minimum thresholds and other customary and agreed exceptions.

     Senior and Senior Secured Notes. Certain of our borrowing groups have issued senior and/or senior secured notes. In general,
our senior and senior secured notes (i) are senior obligations of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group that
rank equally with all of the existing and future senior debt of such issuer and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt
of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group, (ii) contain, in most instances, certain guarantees from other members
of the relevant borrowing group (as specified in the applicable indenture) and (iii) with respect to our senior secured notes, are
secured by certain pledges or liens over the assets and/or shares of certain members of the relevant borrowing group. In addition,
the indentures governing our senior and senior secured notes contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

    •    Our notes contain certain customary incurrence-based covenants. In addition, our notes provide that any failure to pay
         principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace period, or any acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of the
         issuer or certain subsidiaries, over agreed minimum thresholds (as specified under the applicable indenture), is an event
         of default under the respective notes;

    •    Our notes contain certain restrictions which, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the relevant
         borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii)

                                                                II-138
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


         create certain security interests over their assets, in each case, subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions and
         (iv) make certain restricted payments to its direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to Liberty Global)
         through dividends, loans or other distributions, subject to compliance with applicable covenants;

    •    If the relevant issuer or certain of its subsidiaries (as specified in the applicable indenture) sells certain assets, such issuer
         must offer to repurchase the applicable notes at par, or if a change of control (as specified in the applicable indenture)
         occurs, such issuer must offer to repurchase all of the relevant notes at a redemption price of 101%; and

    •    Our senior secured notes contain certain early redemption provisions including the ability to, during each 12-month period
         commencing on the issue date for such notes until the applicable call date, redeem up to 10% of the principal amount of
         the notes to be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus
         accrued and unpaid interest.

     SPE Notes. From time to time, we create special purpose financing entities ("SPEs"), which are 100% owned by third parties,
for the primary purpose of facilitating the offering of senior and senior secured notes, which we collectively refer to as the "SPE
Notes." In this regard, SPE Notes have been issued, and are outstanding at December 31, 2015, by Ziggo Bond Finance B.V.
(Ziggo Bond Finance) and Ziggo Secured Finance B.V. (Ziggo Secured Finance), collectively the "Ziggo SPEs", UPCB Finance
IV Limited (UPCB Finance IV), UPCB Finance V Limited (UPCB Finance V) and UPCB Finance VI Limited (UPCB Finance
VI), collectively the "UPCB SPEs", and Telenet Finance III Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance III), Telenet Finance IV
Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance IV), Telenet Finance V Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance V) and Telenet Finance VI
Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance VI), collectively the "Telenet SPEs."

    The SPEs used the proceeds from the issuance of SPE Notes to fund term loan facilities under their respective borrowing
group (as further described below), each a “Funded Facility” and collectively the “Funded Facilities”. Each SPE is dependent
on payments from the relevant borrower under the applicable Funded Facility in order to service its payment obligations under
each respective SPE Note. Although none of the respective borrowing entities under the Funded Facilities have any equity or
voting interest in any of the relevant SPEs, each of the Funded Facility term loans creates a variable interest in the respective SPE
for which the relevant borrowing entity is the primary beneficiary. As such, each borrowing entity under the relevant Funded
Facility and its parent entities, including Liberty Global, are required to consolidate the relevant SPEs. As a result, the amounts
outstanding under the Funded Facilities are eliminated in the respective borrowing group’s and Liberty Global’s consolidated
financial statements.

     Pursuant to the respective indentures for the SPE Notes (the SPE Indentures) and the respective accession agreements for
the Funded Facilities, the call provisions, maturity and applicable interest rate for each Funded Facility are the same as those of
the related SPE Notes. The SPEs, as lenders under the relevant credit facility for each respective borrowing group, are treated the
same as the other lenders under the respective credit facility, with benefits, rights and protections similar to those afforded to the
other lenders. Through the covenants in the applicable SPE Indentures and the applicable security interests over (i) all of the issued
shares of the relevant SPE and (ii) the relevant SPE’s rights under the applicable Funded Facility granted to secure the relevant
SPE’s obligations under the relevant SPE Notes, the holders of the SPE Notes are provided indirectly with the benefits, rights,
protections and covenants granted to the SPEs as lenders under the respective credit facility. The SPEs are prohibited from incurring
any additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions under the SPE Indentures.

     Subject to the circumstances described below, the Ziggo SPE Notes are non-callable until January 15, 2020. If, however, at
any time prior to January 15, 2020, all or a portion of the loans under the related Ziggo Proceeds Loans are voluntarily prepaid (a
Ziggo Early Redemption Event), then the applicable Ziggo SPE will be required to redeem an aggregate principal amount of its
Ziggo SPE Notes equal to the aggregate principal amount of the loans so prepaid under the relevant Ziggo Proceeds Loan. In
general, the redemption price payable will equal 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Ziggo SPE Notes to be redeemed
and a “make-whole” premium, which is the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments to the first call date using
the discount rate (as specified in the applicable indenture) as of the redemption date plus 50 basis points.

     Upon the occurrence of a Ziggo Early Redemption Event on or after January 15, 2020, the applicable Ziggo SPE will redeem
an aggregate principal amount of its Ziggo SPE Notes equal to the principal amount of the related Ziggo Proceeds Loans prepaid
at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts (as specified in the applicable indenture), if any, to the redemption date, as set forth below:

     2015 Refinancing Transactions. On March 11, 2015, the UM Senior Secured Notes Issuers issued the 2027 UM Senior Secured
Notes. The net proceeds from the 2027 UM Senior Secured Notes were used to (i) redeem 10% of the principal amount of each
of the following series of notes: (a) the 2022 UM Senior Secured Notes, (b) the January 2023 5.75% UM Euro Senior Secured
Notes, (c) the January 2023 5.125% UM Euro Senior Secured Notes and (d) the April 2023 UM Senior Secured Notes, each at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the applicable redeemed principal amount in accordance with the indentures governing each
of the notes, and (ii) prepay the then outstanding balance under the UM Senior Secured Facility (as defined and described under
Unitymedia Revolving Credit Facilities below). In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss on debt modification
and extinguishment, net, of $8.1 million. This loss includes (1) the payment of $6.4 million of redemption premium and (2) the
write-off of $1.7 million of deferred financing costs.

     On March 16, 2015, Unitymedia issued the 2027 UM Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the 2027 UM Senior Notes were
used to fully redeem the €618.0 million ($671.5 million) principal amount of 9.5% senior notes issued by Unitymedia. In connection
with this transaction, we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $91.2 million. This loss includes (i)
the payment of $89.8 million of redemption premium and (ii) the write-off of $1.4 million of unamortized discount.

     On December 23, 2015, the UM Senior Secured Notes Issuers issued the 2026 UM Senior Secured Notes. The net proceeds
from the 2026 UM Senior Secured Notes were used to (i) redeem 10% of the principal amount of each of the following series of
notes: (a) the 2022 UM Senior Secured Notes, (b) the January 2023 5.75% UM Euro Senior Secured Notes, (c) the January 2023
5.125% UM Euro Senior Secured Notes and (d) the April 2023 UM Senior Secured Notes, each at a redemption price equal to
103% of the applicable redeemed principal amount in accordance with the indentures governing each of the notes, and (ii) prepay
the outstanding balance under the UM Senior Secured Facility. As the 10% redemptions of the 2022 UM Senior Secured Notes
and the January 2023 5.125% UM Euro Senior Secured Notes were not completed until January 2016, the related proceeds from
the issuance of the 2026 UM Senior Secured Notes of €108.2 million ($117.6 million) were held in escrow at December 31, 2015
as cash collateral. In connection with the redemption of the January 2023 5.75% UM Euro Senior Secured Notes, the April 2023
UM Senior Secured Notes and the prepayment of the outstanding balance under the UM Senior Secured Facility, we recognized
a loss on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $3.1 million in 2015. This loss includes (1) the payment of $2.6 million
of redemption premium and (2) the write-off of $0.5 million of deferred financing costs.

     2014 and 2013 Refinancing Transactions. During 2014 and 2013, we completed a number of refinancing transactions that
generally resulted in lower interest rates and extended maturities. In connection with these transactions, we recognized losses on
debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $130.8 million and $112.5 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. These losses
include (i) the payment of redemption premiums of $115.1 million and $75.0 million, respectively, (ii) the write-off of deferred
financing costs of $14.0 million and $21.6 million, respectively, (iii) the write-off of unamortized discounts of $12.3 million and
$15.9 million, respectively, and (iv) the write-off during 2014 of $10.6 million of unamortized premium.

    Subject to the circumstances described below, the UPCB Finance IV Dollar Notes are non-callable until January 15, 2020,
the UPCB Finance IV Euro Notes are non-callable until January 15, 2021, the UPCB Finance V Notes are non-callable until
November 15, 2016 and the UPCB Finance VI Notes are non-callable until January 15, 2017 (each a UPCB SPE Notes Call
Date). If, however, at any time prior to the applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date, all or a portion of the loans under the related
UPCB SPE Funded Facility are voluntarily prepaid (a UPCB Early Redemption Event), then the applicable UPCB SPE will be
required to redeem an aggregate principal amount of its UPCB SPE Notes equal to the aggregate principal amount of the loans so
prepaid under the relevant UPCB SPE Funded Facility. In general, the redemption price payable will equal 100% of the principal
amount of the applicable UPCB SPE Notes to be redeemed and a “make-whole” premium, which is the present value of all
remaining scheduled interest payments to the applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date using the discount rate (as specified in the
applicable indenture) as of the redemption date plus 50 basis points.

     Upon the occurrence of a UPCB Early Redemption Event on or after the applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date, the applicable
UPCB SPE will redeem an aggregate principal amount of its UPCB SPE Notes equal to the principal amount of the related UPCB
SPE Funded Facility prepaid at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts (as specified in the applicable indenture), if any, to the applicable redemption date, as
set forth below:

the UPCB Finance IV Euro Notes and (iii) the Additional UPCB Finance IV Dollar Notes, the proceeds of which were used to
fund UPC Facilities AL, AK and AL2, respectively. UPC Facility AL2 has been merged with UPC Facility AL. The net proceeds
from UPC Facility AL and UPC Facility AK were used to (a) prepay the remaining €190.0 million ($206.5 million) outstanding
principal amount of UPC Facility Y, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium, to UPCB
Finance II and, in turn, UPCB Finance II used such proceeds to fully redeem the remaining outstanding amount of its UPCB
Finance II Notes, (b) prepay the $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of UPC Facility Z, together with accrued and unpaid
interest and the related prepayment premium, to UPCB Finance III Limited (UPCB Finance III) and, in turn, UPCB Finance III
used such proceeds to fully redeem the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% senior secured notes, (c) prepay in
full the then outstanding €600.0 million ($652.0 million) amount under UPC Facility AI and (d) prepay 10% of the outstanding
principal amount of each of the following: (1) UPC Facility AC, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment
premium, to UPCB Finance V and, in turn, UPCB Finance V used such proceeds to redeem 10% of the outstanding principal
amount of the UPCB Finance V Notes and (2) UPC Facility AD, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the related prepayment
premium, to UPCB Finance VI and, in turn, UPCB Finance VI used such proceeds to redeem 10% of the outstanding principal
amount of the UPCB Finance VI Notes. The redemption price for the UPCB Finance V Notes and the UPCB Finance VI Notes
was 103% of the applicable redeemed principal amount. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss on debt
modification and extinguishment, net, of $59.6 million. This loss includes (I) the payment of $54.3 million of redemption premium
and (II) the write-off of $5.3 million of deferred financing costs.

   2015 Refinancing Transactions. On July 24, 2015, Telenet Finance VI issued the Telenet Finance VI Notes. Telenet Finance
VI used the proceeds from the Telenet Finance VI Notes to fund Telenet Facility AB. The net proceeds from Telenet Facility AB
were used to prepay the full €500.0 million ($543.3 million) principal amount of Telenet Facility M, together with accrued and
unpaid interest and the related prepayment premium, to Telenet Finance Luxembourg S.C.A. (Telenet Finance) and, in turn,
Telenet Finance used such proceeds to fully redeem the €500.0 million ($543.3 million) principal amount of its 6.375% senior
secured notes. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of $34.3
million, representing the payment of redemption premium.

_______________

(a)      Except as described in (c) below, amounts represent total third-party facility amounts at December 31, 2015 without giving
         effect to the impact of discounts.

(b)      Telenet Facility X has a fee on unused commitments of 1.1% per year.

(c)      As further discussed in the below description of the Telenet SPE Notes, the amounts outstanding under Telenet Facilities
         O, P, U, V and AB are eliminated in Liberty Global’s consolidated financial statements.

(d)      The carrying values of Telenet Facilities W and Y include the impact of discounts.

(e)      On July 1, 2015, (i) the commitments under Telenet’s revolving credit facilities were increased by €85.0 million ($92.4
         million) (Telenet Facility X2) and (ii) a lender under the then existing Telenet Facility S agreed to novate commitments of
         €10.0 million ($10.9 million) to a subsidiary of Telenet and enter into the new Telenet Facility X2, which was subsequently
         merged with Telenet Facility X, resulting in total increased availability under Telenet Facility X of €95.0 million ($103.3
         million). In September 2015, Telenet Facility S, which was undrawn, was cancelled.

(f)      On May 7, 2015, Telenet International entered into a new revolving credit facility (Telenet Facility Z) and a new term loan
         facility (Telenet Facility AA). At December 31, 2015, Telenet Facility Z and Telenet Facility AA were undrawn. In February
         2016, Telenet borrowed the full amount under Telenet Facility Z and Telenet Facility AA and €217.0 million ($245.9 million
         at the transaction date) under Telenet Facility X to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to acquire BASE Company
         N.V. (BASE). Although Telenet currently has the ability, subject to certain restrictions and covenant limitations, to draw
         certain amounts under Telenet Facility Z and Telenet Facility AA for general corporate purposes, we expect that these
         facilities will remain undrawn until the closing of the acquisition of BASE. Accordingly, Telenet’s unused borrowing capacity
         at December 31, 2015 excludes the availability under Telenet Facility Z and Telenet Facility AA. For information regarding
         Telenet’s acquisition of BASE, see note 20.

     2014 Refinancing Transactions. During 2014, we completed a number of refinancing transactions that generally resulted in
lower interest rates and extended maturities. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss on debt modification and
extinguishment, net, of $11.9 million, which includes (i) the write-off of $7.1 million of deferred financing costs, (ii) the payment
of $3.6 million of redemption premium and (iii) the write-off of $1.2 million of unamortized discount.

  VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes

     On January 24, 2014, VTR Finance issued $1.4 billion principal amount of VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes. At any time
prior to January 15, 2019, VTR Finance may redeem some or all of the VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes by paying a “make-
whole” premium, which is the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments to January 15, 2019 using the discount
rate (as specified in the VTR Indenture) as of the applicable redemption date plus 50 basis points.

     VTR Finance may redeem all or part of the VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes at the following redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts (as specified in the VTR Indenture),
if any, to the applicable redemption date, as set forth below:

(a)     The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 20.0%, 21.0% and 23.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(b)     Country jurisdictions giving rise to increases are grouped together and shown separately from country jurisdictions giving
        rise to decreases.

(c)     In November 2015, it was announced that the U.K. corporate income tax rate will change from the current rate of 20.0%
        to 19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020. The impact of these rate changes on our deferred tax balances was recorded
        in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the relevant legislation was enacted. In April 2014, the U.K. corporate income tax rate
        decreased from 23.0% to 21.0%. Substantially all of the impact of the April 2014 rate change on our deferred tax balances
        was recorded in the third quarter of 2013 when the relevant legislation was enacted.

(d)     Amounts reflect adjustments (either an increase or a decrease) to “expected” tax benefit for statutory rates in jurisdictions
        in which we operate outside of the U.K.

     Our deferred income tax valuation allowance decreased $283.8 million in 2015. This decrease reflects the net effect of (i) the
net tax expense related to our continuing operations of $501.5 million, (ii) foreign currency translation adjustments, (iii) the effect
of enacted tax law and rate changes and (iv) other individually insignificant items.

     Virgin Media had property and equipment on which future U.K. tax deductions can be claimed of $21.0 billion and $21.6
billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The maximum amount of these “capital allowances” that can be claimed in
any one year is 18% of the remaining balance, after additions, disposals and prior claims. The tax effects of the excess of these
capital allowances over the related financial reporting bases are included in the 2015 and 2014 deferred tax assets related to property
and equipment, net, in the above table.

     At December 31, 2015, our unrecognized excess tax benefits aggregated $179.0 million. These excess tax benefits, which
represent tax deductions in excess of the financial reporting expense for share-based compensation, will not be recognized for
financial reporting purposes until such time as these tax benefits can be realized as a reduction of income taxes payable. The tax
effects of these unrecognized excess tax benefits are not included in the above table.

     The significant components of our tax loss carryforwards and related tax assets at December 31, 2015 are as follows:

     Our tax loss carryforwards within each jurisdiction combine all companies’ tax losses (both capital and ordinary losses) in
that jurisdiction, however, certain tax jurisdictions limit the ability to offset taxable income of a separate company or different tax
group with the tax losses associated with another separate company or group. Further, tax jurisdictions restrict the type of taxable
income that the above losses are able to offset. The majority of the tax losses shown in the above table are not expected to be
realized, including certain losses that are limited in use due to change in control or same business tests.

      We intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain non-U.S. operations except to the extent the earnings are subject to
current income taxes. At December 31, 2015, income and withholding taxes for which a net deferred tax liability might otherwise
be required have not been provided on an estimated $9.1 billion of cumulative temporary differences (including, for this purpose,
any difference between the aggregate tax basis in stock of a consolidated subsidiary and the corresponding amount of the subsidiary’s
net equity, including cumulative translation adjustments, determined for financial reporting purposes) on non-U.S. entities. The
determination of the additional withholding tax that would arise upon a reversal of temporary differences is impractical to estimate
as it is subject to offset by available foreign tax credits and subject to certain limitations.

    In general, a U.K. or U.S. corporation may claim a foreign tax credit against its income tax expense for foreign income taxes
paid or accrued. A U.S. corporation may also claim a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued on the earnings of a foreign
corporation paid to the U.S. corporation as a dividend.

     Our ability to claim a foreign tax credit for dividends received from our foreign subsidiaries or foreign taxes paid or accrued
is subject to various significant limitations under U.S. tax laws including a limited carry back and carry forward period. Some of
our operating companies are located in countries with which the U.K. or U.S. does not have income tax treaties. Because we lack

                                                                                           II-164

treaty protection in these countries, we may be subject to high rates of withholding taxes on distributions and other payments from
these operating companies and may be subject to double taxation on our income. Limitations on the ability to claim a foreign tax
credit, lack of treaty protection in some countries and the inability to offset losses in one jurisdiction against income earned in
another jurisdiction could result in a high effective tax rate on our earnings. Since a significant portion of our revenue is generated
outside of the U.K. and substantially all of our revenue is generated outside the U.S., including in jurisdictions that do not have
tax treaties with the U.K. or U.S., these risks are greater for us than for companies that generate most of their revenue in the U.K.
or U.S. or in jurisdictions that have these treaties.

     Through our subsidiaries, we maintain a presence in many countries. Many of these countries maintain highly complex tax
regimes that differ significantly from the system of income taxation used in the U.K. and the U.S. We have accounted for the effect
of these taxes based on what we believe is reasonably expected to apply to us and our subsidiaries based on tax laws currently in
effect and reasonable interpretations of these laws. Because some jurisdictions do not have systems of taxation that are as well
established as the system of income taxation used in the U.K., U.S. or tax regimes used in other major industrialized countries, it
may be difficult to anticipate how other jurisdictions will tax our and our subsidiaries’ current and future operations.

     Although we intend to take reasonable tax planning measures to limit our tax exposures, no assurance can be given that we
will be able to do so.

     We and our subsidiaries file consolidated and standalone income tax returns in various jurisdictions. In the normal course of
business, our income tax filings are subject to review by various taxing authorities. In connection with such reviews, disputes
could arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain income tax rules related to our business in
that tax jurisdiction. Such disputes may result in future tax and interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities. The
ultimate resolution of tax contingencies will take place upon the earlier of (i) the settlement date with the applicable taxing authorities
in either cash or agreement of income tax positions or (ii) the date when the tax authorities are statutorily prohibited from adjusting
the company’s tax computations.

     In general, tax returns filed by our company or our subsidiaries for years prior to 2008 are no longer subject to examination
by tax authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently involved in income tax examinations in various jurisdictions in which
we operate, including Chile (2010 through 2012), the Czech Republic (2013), Germany (2008 through 2013), Hungary (2012
through 2013), the Netherlands (2013 through 2015), Poland (2013), Slovakia (2011), Switzerland (2011-2012) and the U.S. (2009
through 2015). Except as noted below, any adjustments that might arise from the foregoing examinations are not expected to have
a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In the U.S., we have received notices of adjustment
from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to our 2013, 2010 and 2009 income tax returns, as well as a proposed adjustment
to our 2013 withholding tax return. We have entered into the appeals process with respect to the 2010 and 2009 matters. While
we believe that the ultimate resolution of these proposed adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows, no assurance can be given that this will be the case given the amounts involved and
the complex nature of the related issues.

     The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits are summarized below:

     No assurance can be given that any of these tax benefits will be recognized or realized.

                                                                                     II-165

                                             December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013



    As of December 31, 2015, our unrecognized tax benefits included $299.4 million of tax benefits that would have a favorable
impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by
valuation allowances and other factors.

     During 2016, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of ongoing examinations by tax authorities as well as expiration of
statutes of limitation could result in significant reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken as of
December 31, 2015. The amount of any such reductions could range up to $250 million. Other than the potential impacts of these
ongoing examinations and the expected expiration of certain statutes of limitation, we do not expect any material changes to our
unrecognized tax benefits during 2016. No assurance can be given as to the nature or impact of any changes in our unrecognized
tax positions during 2016.

    During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the income tax benefit (expense) of our continuing operations includes net income tax expense
of $10.3 million, $10.9 million and $14.0 million, respectively, representing the net accrual of interest and penalties during the
period. Our other long-term liabilities include accrued interest and penalties of $61.4 million at December 31, 2015.

(12)     Equity

  Capitalization

     Our authorized share capital consists of an aggregate nominal amount of $20.0 million, consisting of any of the following:

each with a nominal value of $0.01 per share, (iii) preference shares, with a nominal value to be determined by the board of
directors, the issuance of one or more classes or series of which as may be authorized by the board of directors, and (iv) any other
shares of one or more classes as may be determined by the board of directors or by the shareholders of Liberty Global.

    Under Liberty Global’s Articles of Association, effective as of July 1, 2015, holders of Liberty Global Class A ordinary shares
and LiLAC Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each such share held, and holders of Liberty Global Class B ordinary

ordinary share is reserved for issuance for each Liberty Global Class B ordinary share that is issued (10,472,517 shares issued as
of December 31, 2015), and one LiLAC Class A ordinary share is reserved for issuance for each LiLAC Class B ordinary share
(523,423 shares issued as of December 31, 2015). At December 31, 2015, there were (i) 873,333 and 2,738,536 Liberty Global
Class A and Class C ordinary shares, respectively, reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options, (ii) 10,582,609 and
27,314,828 Liberty Global Class A and Class C ordinary shares, respectively, reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding SARs

(c) 88,016, 33,333 and 114,643 LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares, respectively, reserved for issuance pursuant
to outstanding PSUs, PGUs and RSUs.

     Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding class of our preference shares, the holders of Liberty Global and LiLAC
Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares will be entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board
of directors from funds available therefore. Such dividends may be declared in favor of Liberty Global Ordinary Shares and LiLAC
Ordinary Shares, in equal or unequal amounts, or only in favor of the Liberty Global Ordinary Shares or the LiLAC Ordinary
Shares. There are currently no contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends in cash or shares.

    In the event of our liquidation, dissolution and winding up, after payment or provision for payment of our debts and liabilities
and subject to the prior payment in full of any preferential amounts to which our preference shareholders may be entitled, the
holders of Liberty Global ordinary shares and LiLAC ordinary shares will be entitled to receive their proportionate interests,

expressed in liquidation units, in any assets available for distribution to our ordinary shares regardless of whether such assets are
then attributed to the Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group. Liquidation units will be allocated to each Liberty Global ordinary
share and each LiLAC ordinary share, respectively, based on their respective volume-weighted average price over the 20 trading-
day period commencing shortly after the commencement of ordinary-course (regular-way) trading of the LiLAC Shares. Pursuant
to the terms of our articles of association, the liquidation units for each Liberty Global Share and each LiLAC Share are 1 and
0.94893, respectively.

     On January 26, 2014, our board of directors approved a share split in the form of a share dividend (the 2014 Share Dividend),
which constitutes a bonus issue under our articles of association and English law, of one Liberty Global Class C ordinary share
on each outstanding Liberty Global Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary share as of the February 14, 2014 record date. The
distribution date for the 2014 Share Dividend was March 3, 2014. All Liberty Global share and per share amounts presented herein
give retrospective effect to the 2014 Share Dividend.

    A summary of the changes in our share capital during 2015 is set forth in the table below:

  Share Repurchases

    During 2015, 2014 and 2013, our board of directors authorized various share repurchase programs, the most recent of which
provides for the repurchase of up to $4.5 billion (before direct acquisition costs) of Liberty Global Class A and/or Class C ordinary
shares. Under these plans, we receive authorization to acquire up to the specified amount of Liberty Global Class A and Class C
ordinary shares or other authorized securities from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which
may include derivative transactions. The timing of the repurchase of shares or other securities pursuant to our equity repurchase
programs, which may be suspended or discontinued at any time, is dependent on a variety of factors, including market conditions.
As of December 31, 2015, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was $1,601.1 million. Subsequent to
December 31, 2015, our board of directors increased this amount to $4.0 billion.

    As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our “Distributable
Reserves.” Distributable Reserves, which are not linked to a GAAP reported amount, may be created through the earnings of the
U.K. parent company and, amongst other methods, through a reduction in share premium approved by the English Companies
Court. Based on the amounts set forth in our 2014 U.K. Companies Act Report dated April 27, 2015, which are our most recent
“Relevant Accounts” for the purposes of determining our Distributable Reserves under U.K. law, our Distributable Reserves are
$27.9 billion. This amount does not reflect earnings, share repurchases or other activity that occurred in 2015, each of which
impacts the amount of our Distributable Reserves.

        Shares from July 1 through December 31, 2015.

(c)     Amounts include repurchases of Old Liberty Global Shares.

  Call Option Contracts

    From time to time, we enter into call option contracts pursuant to which we contemporaneously (i) sell call options on shares
of Liberty Global ordinary shares and (ii) purchase call options on an equivalent number of shares of Liberty Global ordinary
shares with an exercise price of zero. These contracts can result in the receipt of cash and shares of Liberty Global ordinary shares.
Shares acquired through the exercise of the call options are included in our share repurchases and the net gain on cash settled
contracts is recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of equity.

  Acquisition of Interests in VTR and VTR Wireless

     On March 14, 2014, a subsidiary of VTR Finance acquired each of the 20.0% noncontrolling ownership interests in VTR and
VTR Wireless SpA (VTR Wireless) from Inversiones Corp Comm 2 SpA (the VTR NCI Acquisition), formerly known as Corp
Comm S.A. (the VTR NCI Owner). VTR Wireless was an indirect subsidiary of Liberty Global that was merged with a subsidiary
of VTR in December 2014. The consideration for the VTR NCI Acquisition was satisfied by the allotment and issuance of 10,091,178
Old Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares to the VTR NCI Owner. The VTR NCI Acquisition has been accounted for as an equity
transaction, the net effect of which was to record the issued Old Liberty Global Class C shares at the $185.4 million carrying value
of the acquired noncontrolling interests.

  Other

     Telenet Tender. On December 17, 2012, Binan Investments B.V. (Binan), our wholly-owned subsidiary, launched a voluntary
and conditional cash public offer (the Telenet Tender) for (i) all of Telenet’s issued shares that Binan did not already own or that
were not held by Telenet (the Telenet Bid Shares) and (ii) certain outstanding vested and unvested employee warrants (the Telenet
Bid Warrants). As of the February 1, 2013 transaction date of the Telenet Tender, the offer price for the Telenet Bid Shares was
€35.00 ($47.85) per share. The offer prices for the Telenet Bid Warrants, which were calculated using the Black Scholes option
pricing model and a price of €35.00 for each of the Telenet Bid Shares, ranged from €13.48 ($18.43) per share to €25.47 ($34.82)
per share.

    Pursuant to the Telenet Tender, we paid aggregate consideration of €332.5 million ($454.6 million at the transaction date) to
acquire (i) 9,497,637 of the Telenet Bid Shares, increasing our ownership interest in Telenet’s issued and outstanding shares at
such date to 58.4%, and (ii) 3,000 of the Telenet Bid Warrants. As we owned a controlling financial interest in Telenet prior to the
launch of the Telenet Tender, we accounted for the impact of the acquisition of the additional Telenet shares as an equity transaction.

                                                                             II-168

     Subsidiary Distributions. From time to time, Telenet, VTR and certain other of our subsidiaries make cash distributions to
their respective shareholders. Our share of these distributions is eliminated in consolidation and the noncontrolling interest owners’
share of these distributions is reflected as a charge against noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of equity.

  Restricted Net Assets

     The ability of certain of our subsidiaries to distribute or loan all or a portion of their net assets to our company is limited by
the terms of applicable debt facilities. At December 31, 2015, substantially all of our net assets represented net assets of our
subsidiaries that were subject to such limitations.

(13)        Share-based Compensation

   Our share-based compensation expense is based on the share-based incentive awards held by our and our subsidiaries’
employees, including awards issued by Liberty Global.

         for certain executive officers and key employees (the Challenge Performance Awards) and (iii) for 2015 and 2014, PGUs
         to our Chief Executive Officer, as described below. The Challenge Performance Awards include PSARs and PSUs.

(b)      In connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition, we issued Liberty Global share-based incentive awards (Virgin Media
         Replacement Awards) to employees and former directors of Virgin Media in exchange for corresponding Virgin Media
         awards. Virgin Media recorded share-based compensation expense of $54.1 million and $55.8 million during 2015 and
         2014, respectively, including compensation expense related to the Virgin Media Replacement Awards and new awards that
                                                                                          II-169

                                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


      were granted after the Virgin Media Replacement Awards were issued. During 2013, Virgin Media recorded share-based
      compensation expense of $134.3 million, primarily related to the Virgin Media Replacement Awards, including $80.1 million
      that was charged to expense in recognition of the Virgin Media Replacement Awards that were fully vested on June 7, 2013
      or for which vesting was accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Virgin Media Merger Agreement on or prior to December 31,
      2013.

(c)   In connection with the LiLAC Transaction, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved modifications
      to our outstanding share-based incentive awards (the Award Modifications) in accordance with the underlying share-based
      incentive plans. The objective of the compensation committee was to ensure a relatively unchanged intrinsic value of
      outstanding equity awards before and after the bonus issuance of the LiLAC Shares. The mechanism to modify outstanding
      share-based incentive awards, as approved by the compensation committee, utilized the volume-weighted average price of
      the respective shares for the five days prior to and the five days following the bonus issuance (Modification VWAPs). In
      order to determine if any incremental stock-based compensation expense should be recorded as a result of the Award
      Modifications, we are required to measure the changes in the fair values of the then outstanding share-based incentive
      awards using market prices immediately before and immediately after the Award Modifications. Due to declines in the
      share prices of our Class A and Class C Liberty Global Shares following the bonus issuance, the exercise prices of options,
      SARs and PSARs determined using the Modification VWAPs were lower than the exercise prices that would have resulted
      if the market prices immediately before and after the Award Modifications had been used. Accordingly, the Black-Scholes
      fair values of our options, SARs and PSARs increased as a result of the Award Modifications, resulting in incremental
      stock-based compensation expense of $99.3 million. This amount includes $69.3 million of expense recognized during
      2015 related to awards that vested on or prior to December 31, 2015 and $30.0 million of expense that will be recognized
      in future periods through 2019 as the related awards vest.

(d)   Represents the share-based compensation expense associated with Telenet’s share-based incentive awards, which, at
      December 31, 2015, included (i) warrants and employee stock options (1,813,815 awards outstanding at a weighted average
      exercise price of €42.17 ($45.82)), (ii) performance-based specific stock option plans for the Chief Executive Officer
      (745,000 awards outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of €40.60 ($44.12)), (iii) performance-based share award
      (82,747 awards outstanding) and (iv) an employee share purchase plan. During 2013, Telenet modified the terms of certain
      of its share-based incentive plans to provide for anti-dilution adjustments in connection with its shareholder returns. In
      connection with these anti-dilution adjustments, Telenet recognized share-based compensation expense of $32.7 million
      and continues to recognize additional share-based compensation expense as the underlying options vest. In addition, during
      2013, Telenet recognized expense of $6.2 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain options.

(e)   The amount for 2015 includes the reversal of $1.8 million of share-based compensation expense, primarily related to
      forfeitures of unvested PSUs during the first quarter of 2015.

  Share Incentive Plans — Liberty Global Ordinary Shares

  Incentive Plans

     As of December 31, 2015, we are authorized to grant incentive awards under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan and the
Liberty Global 2014 Nonemployee Director Incentive Plan. Generally, we may grant non-qualified share options, SARs, restricted
shares, RSUs, cash awards, performance awards or any combination of the foregoing under either of these incentive plans
(collectively, awards). Ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards made under these incentive plans will be made available from
either authorized but unissued shares or shares that have been issued but reacquired by our company. Awards may be granted at
or above fair value in any class of ordinary shares. The maximum number of Liberty Global ordinary shares with respect to which
awards may be issued under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan and the Liberty Global 2014 Nonemployee Director Incentive
Plan is 105 million (of which no more than 50.25 million shares may consist of Class B ordinary shares) and 10.5 million,
respectively, in each case, subject to anti-dilution and other adjustment provisions in the respective plan. As of December 31, 2015,
the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan and the Liberty Global 2014 Nonemployee Director Incentive Plan had 84,782,474 and
10,120,239 ordinary shares available for grant, respectively.


                                                                                   II-171

     In connection with the Virgin Media Acquisition, we assumed the VM Incentive Plan. Awards under the VM Incentive Plan
issued prior to June 7, 2013 have a 10-year term and become fully exercisable within five years of continued employment. Certain
performance-based awards that were granted during the first quarter of 2013 were canceled upon completion of the Virgin Media
Acquisition. These canceled awards were subsequently replaced by PSUs that were granted under the VM Incentive Plan on June
24, 2013. For the remaining performance-based awards that were outstanding prior to June 7, 2013, the performance objectives
lapsed upon the completion of the Virgin Media Acquisition and such awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.

     Awards (other than performance-based awards) issued under the Liberty Global 2005 Incentive Plan and under the VM
Incentive Plan after June 7, 2013 generally (i) vest 12.5% on the six month anniversary of the grant date and then vest at a rate of
6.25% each quarter thereafter and (ii) expire seven years after the grant date. Awards (other than RSUs) issued under the Liberty
Global 2005 Director Incentive Plan generally vest in three equal annual installments, provided the director continues to serve as
director immediately prior to the vesting date, and expire 10 years after the grant date. RSUs vest on the date of the first annual
general meeting of shareholders following the grant date. No further awards will be granted under the Liberty Global 2005 Incentive
Plan, the Liberty Global 2005 Director Incentive Plan or the VM Incentive Plan.

     Awards (other than performance-based awards) under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan generally (i) vest 12.5% on the
six month anniversary of the grant date and then vest at a rate of 6.25% each quarter thereafter and (ii) expire seven years after
the grant date. Awards (other than RSUs) issued under the Liberty Global 2014 Nonemployee Director Incentive Plan generally
vest in three equal annual installments, provided the director continues to serve as director immediately prior to the vesting date,
and expire seven years after the grant date. RSUs vest on the date of the first annual general meeting of shareholders following
the grant date. These awards may be granted at or above fair value in any class of ordinary shares.

  Performance Awards

    The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions with respect to our performance-based awards for certain
executive officers and key employees. These awards were granted under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan, the Liberty Global
2005 Incentive Plan and the VM Incentive Plan.

     Liberty Global PSUs. PSUs are granted to executive officers and key employees annually based on a target annual equity
value for each executive and key employee, of which approximately two-thirds would be delivered in the form of an annual award
of PSUs and approximately one-third in the form of an annual award of SARs. Each currently-outstanding PSU represents the
right to receive one Liberty Global or LiLAC Class A or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, subject to performance and vesting.
Generally, the performance period for the PSUs covers a two-year period and the performance target is based on the achievement
of a specified compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in a consolidated Adjusted OIBDA metric (as defined in note 18), adjusted
for events such as acquisitions, dispositions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect comparability (Adjusted
OIBDA CAGR), and the participant’s annual performance ratings during the two-year performance period. A performance range
of 75% to 125% of the target Adjusted OIBDA CAGR generally results in award recipients earning 50% to 150% of their respective
PSUs, subject to reduction or forfeiture based on individual performance. The PSUs generally vest 50% on each of March 31 and
September 30 of the year following the end of the performance period.

     Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the grant of up to 6.26
million PSU awards pursuant to a performance plan that is based on the achievement of a specified Adjusted OIBDA CAGR during
the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 (with 2015 as the base year). We expect that over 95% of these awards will cover
Liberty Global Shares and the remainder will cover LiLAC Shares.

     Liberty Global Challenge Performance Awards. Effective June 24, 2013, our compensation committee approved the Challenge
Performance Awards, which consisted solely of PSARs for our senior executive officers and a combination of PSARs and PSUs
for our other executive officers and key employees. Each PSU represents the right to receive one Liberty Global or LiLAC Class
A or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, subject to performance and vesting. The performance criteria for the Challenge
Performance Awards will be based on the participant’s performance and achievement of individual goals in each of the years 2013,
2014 and 2015. Subject to forfeitures and the satisfaction of performance conditions, 100% of each participant’s Challenge
Performance Awards will vest on June 24, 2016. The PSARs have a term of seven years and base prices equal to the respective
market closing prices of the applicable class on the grant date.



                                                              II-172

     Liberty Global Performance Grant Award. Effective May 1, 2014, our compensation committee authorized the grant of PGUs
to our Chief Executive Officer, comprising a total of one million PGUs with respect to Class A Old Liberty Global Shares and
one million PGUs with respect to Class B Old Liberty Global Shares. The PGUs, which were subject to a performance condition
that was achieved in 2014, vest in three equal annual installments, the first of which occurred on March 15, 2015. As a result of
the LiLAC Transaction, our Chief Executive Officer also received 33,333 PGUs with respect to Class A LiLAC Shares and 33,333
PGUs with respect to Class B LiLAC Shares, each of which vest over the same period as the May 1, 2014 award grant described
above.

    We expect to record significant restructuring charges during 2016, due largely to our ongoing company-wide effort to optimize
our operating model. In addition, we expect to undertake restructuring programs in certain of our operating segments, including
programs to be undertaken in connection with the integration of acquired entities.

     A summary of changes in our restructuring liabilities during 2014 is set forth in the table below:

                                                                                                      Employee

     Prior to March 31, 2014, Telenet operated a DTT business that served a limited number of subscribers. The DTT network was
accessed by Telenet pursuant to third-party capacity contracts that were accounted for as operating agreements. On March 31,
2014, Telenet discontinued the provision of DTT services and, accordingly, recorded an $86.1 million restructuring charge during
the three months ended March 31, 2014. This charge was equal to the then fair value of the remaining payments due under the
DTT capacity contracts.

    Our restructuring charges during 2014 also included $17.5 million, $11.2 million, $10.7 million, $10.1 million and $9.8 million
of employee severance and termination costs related to reorganization and integration activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the
Netherlands, Germany, Chile and the European Operations Division’s central operations, respectively.

     A summary of changes in our restructuring liabilities during 2013 is set forth in the table below:

     As further described in note 9, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $84.9 million during the third and fourth quarters
of 2013 as a result of VTR’s decision to cease commercial use of its mobile network. These restructuring charges included the
fair value of (i) the then remaining payments due under VTR’s tower and real estate operating leases of $71.5 million and (ii)
certain other required payments associated with VTR’s mobile network. In addition, our restructuring charges during 2013 included
                                                              II-182

activities in U.K./Ireland, Germany and Chile, respectively.

(15)        Defined Benefit Plans

    Certain of our subsidiaries in Europe maintain various funded and unfunded defined benefit plans for their employees. A
significant portion of these defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants and existing participants do not accrue any additional
benefits.

       The table below provides summary information on our defined benefit plans:

                                                                                                                                          Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                                                      2015          2014        2013

_______________

(a)      The fair value of plan assets is primarily based on Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy (as further described in note
         8). Our plan assets comprise investments in debt securities, equity securities, hedge funds, insurance contracts and certain
         other assets.

(b)      The 2015 amount excludes aggregate curtailment gains of $7.9 million, which are included in impairment, restructuring
         and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statement of operations.

    Based on December 31, 2015 exchange rates and information available as of that date, our subsidiaries’ contributions to their
respective defined benefit plans in 2016 are expected to aggregate $56.0 million.

(16)        Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings

    Accumulated other comprehensive earnings included in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of equity reflect the
aggregate impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and pension-related adjustments and other. The changes in the
components of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of taxes, are summarized as follows:

(17)      Commitments and Contingencies

  Commitments

     In the normal course of business, we have entered into agreements that commit our company to make cash payments in future
periods with respect to programming contracts, network and connectivity commitments, non-cancellable operating leases,
purchases of customer premises and other equipment and other items. The following table sets forth the U.S. dollar equivalents
of such commitments as of December 31, 2015:
                                                                               Payments due during:
                                                   2016             2017        2018         2019           2020     Thereafter     Total
                                                                                          in millions


  Programming commitments........... $ 1,004.5                  $    883.7    $     698.6   $   272.2   $     11.0   $     7.6    $ 2,877.6

  Operating leases .............................        151.6       126.3         107.1          85.1         58.3       276.4        804.8
  Other commitments........................              68.2        31.3          23.1          19.3          9.3        17.0        168.2
     Total (a)..................................... $ 2,907.4   $ 1,510.2     $ 1,062.3     $   514.5   $    174.9   $ 1,294.9    $ 7,464.2
_______________

(a)    The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our December 31, 2015 consolidated
       balance sheet.

     Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming, studio output and sports rights
contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual
number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose
of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. In addition, programming
commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are
not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the
amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented
a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods. In this regard,
our total third-party programming and copyright costs aggregated $2,313.9 million (including $2,066.6 million for the Liberty
Global Group and $247.3 million for the LiLAC Group), $2,160.0 million (including $1,928.0 million for the Liberty Global
Group and $232.0 million for the LiLAC Group) and $1,631.0 million (including $1,385.1 million for the Liberty Global Group
and $245.9 million for the LiLAC Group) during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

     Network and connectivity commitments include (i) Telenet’s commitments for certain operating costs associated with its
leased network, (ii) commitments associated with our MVNO agreements, (iii) service commitments associated with our network
extension projects, primarily in the U.K. and (iv) certain repair and maintenance, fiber capacity and energy commitments of
Unitymedia. Effective October 1, 2015, Telenet’s commitments for certain operating costs are subject to adjustment based on
changes in the network operating costs incurred by Telenet with respect to its own networks. These potential adjustments are not
subject to reasonable estimation and, therefore, are not included in the above table. The amounts reflected in the above table with
respect to certain of our MVNO commitments represent fixed minimum amounts payable under these agreements and, therefore,
may be significantly less than the actual amounts we ultimately pay in these periods.

    Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) the purchase of customer premises
and other equipment and (ii) certain service-related commitments, including call center, information technology and maintenance
services.

   Commitments arising from acquisition agreements are not reflected in the above table. For information regarding our
commitments under acquisition agreements, see note 4.


                                                                           II-185

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


     In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments
and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For
information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments
during 2015, 2014 and 2013, see note 7. For information regarding our defined benefit plans, see note 15.

     We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities and municipalities,
which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts or to upgrade, rebuild or extend
portions of our broadband communication systems. Such amounts are not included in the above table because they are not fixed
or determinable.

     Rental expense of our continuing operations under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements amounted to $219.0 million
(including $204.7 million for the Liberty Global Group and $14.3 million for the LiLAC Group), $268.3 million (including $252.0
million for the Liberty Global Group and $16.3 million for the LiLAC Group) and $238.6 million (including $203.7 million for
the Liberty Global Group and $34.9 million for the LiLAC Group) during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. It is expected that
in the normal course of business, operating leases that expire generally will be renewed or replaced by similar leases.

     We have established various defined contribution benefit plans for our and our subsidiaries’ employees. The aggregate expense
of our continuing operations for matching contributions under the various defined contribution employee benefit plans was $76.7
million (including $75.0 million for the Liberty Global Group and $1.7 million for the LiLAC Group), $63.2 million (including
$61.7 million for the Liberty Global Group and $1.5 million for the LiLAC Group) and $48.2 million (including $47.6 million
for the Liberty Global Group and $0.6 million for the LiLAC Group) during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  Guarantees and Other Credit Enhancements

     In the ordinary course of business, we may provide (i) indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain other parties
and (ii) performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors. Historically, these arrangements
have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments
in the future.

  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies

     Interkabel Acquisition. On November 26, 2007, Telenet and the PICs announced a non-binding agreement-in-principle to
transfer the analog and digital television activities of the PICs, including all existing subscribers to Telenet. Subsequently, Telenet
and the PICs entered into a binding agreement (the 2008 PICs Agreement), which closed effective October 1, 2008. Beginning
in December 2007, Proximus NV/SA (Proximus), the incumbent telecommunications operator in Belgium, instituted several
proceedings seeking to block implementation of these agreements. Proximus lodged summary proceedings with the President of
the Court of First Instance of Antwerp to obtain a provisional injunction preventing the PICs from effecting the agreement-in-
principle and initiated a civil procedure on the merits claiming the annulment of the agreement-in-principle. In March 2008, the
President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of Proximus in the summary proceedings, which ruling was
overturned by the Court of Appeal of Antwerp in June 2008. Proximus brought this appeal judgment before the Cour de Cassation
(the Belgian Supreme Court), which confirmed the appeal judgment in September 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Court of First
Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of the PICs and Telenet in the civil procedure on the merits, dismissing Proximus’s request for
the rescission of the agreement-in-principle and the 2008 PICs Agreement. On June 12, 2009, Proximus appealed this judgment
with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. In this appeal, Proximus is now also seeking compensation for damages should the 2008
PICs Agreement not be rescinded. While these proceedings were suspended indefinitely, other proceedings were initiated, which
resulted in a ruling by the Belgian Council of State in May 2014 annulling (i) the decision of the PICs not to organize a public
market consultation and (ii) the decision from the PICs’ board of directors to approve the 2008 PICs Agreement. In December
2015, Proximus resumed the civil proceedings pending with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp seeking to have the 2008 PICs
Agreement annulled and claiming damages of €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion).

    Telenet is in the process of evaluating the resumed proceedings and claim for damages and intends to defend itself vigorously.
No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these or other proceedings. However, an unfavorable outcome of existing or future
proceedings could potentially lead to the annulment of the 2008 PICs Agreement and/or to an obligation of Telenet to pay
compensation for damages, subject to the relevant provisions of the 2008 PICs Agreement, which stipulate that Telenet is only
responsible for damages in excess of €20.0 million ($21.7 million). We do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have

                                                                II-186

a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. No amounts have been accrued by us with respect
to this matter as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable.

     Deutsche Telekom Litigation. On December 28, 2012, Unitymedia filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Telekom in which
Unitymedia asserts that it pays excessive prices for the co-use of Deutsche Telekom’s cable ducts in Unitymedia’s footprint. The
Federal Network Agency approved rates for the co-use of certain ducts of Deutsche Telekom in March 2011. Based in part on
these approved rates, Unitymedia is seeking a reduction of the annual lease fees (approximately €76 million ($83 million) for
2012) by approximately two-thirds and the return of similarly calculated overpayments from 2009 through the ultimate settlement
date, plus accrued interest. While we expect a decision by the court of first instance during 2016, the resolution of this matter may
take several years and no assurance can be given that Unitymedia’s claims will be successful. Any recovery by Unitymedia will
not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition of this matter has been reached.

     Vivendi Litigation. A wholly-owned subsidiary of our company is a plaintiff in certain litigation titled Liberty Media
Corporation, et. al. v. Vivendi S.A. and Universal Studios. A predecessor of Liberty Global was a subsidiary of Liberty Media
Corporation (Liberty Media) through June 6, 2004. In connection with Liberty Media’s prosecution of the action, our subsidiary
assigned its rights to Liberty Media in exchange for a contingent payout in the event Liberty Media recovered any amounts as a
result of the action. Our subsidiary’s interest in any such recovery will be equal to 10% of the recovery amount, including any
interest awarded, less the amount to be retained by Liberty Media for (i) all fees and expenses incurred by Liberty Media in
connection with the action (including expenses to be incurred in connection with any appeals and the payment of certain deferred
legal fees) and (ii) agreed upon interest on such fees and expenses. On January 17, 2013, following a jury trial, the court entered
a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of €944 million ($1,026 million), including prejudgment interest. Vivendi
S.A. and Universal Studios have filed a notice of appeal of the court’s final judgment to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. As
a result, the amount that our subsidiary may ultimately recover in connection with the final resolution of the action, if any, is
uncertain. Any recovery by our company will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final
disposition of this matter has been reached.

     Liberty Puerto Rico Matter. In November 2012, we completed a business combination that resulted in, among other matters,
the combination of our then operating subsidiary in Puerto Rico with San Juan Cable, LLC dba OneLink Communications
(OneLink). In connection with this transaction (the OneLink Acquisition), Liberty Puerto Rico, as the surviving entity, became
a party to certain claims previously asserted by the incumbent telephone operator against OneLink based on alleged conduct of
OneLink that occurred prior to the OneLink Acquisition (the PRTC Claim). The PRTC Claim includes an allegation that OneLink
acted in an anticompetitive manner in connection with a series of legal and regulatory proceedings it initiated against the incumbent
telephone operator in Puerto Rico beginning in 2009. In March 2014, a separate class action claim was filed in Puerto Rico (the
Class Action Claim) containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted in the PRTC Claim, but alleging ongoing injury
on behalf of a consumer class (as opposed to harm to a competitor). The former owners of OneLink have partially indemnified
us through November 27, 2016 for any losses we may incur in connection with the PRTC Claim up to a specified maximum
amount. However, the indemnity does not cover any potential losses resulting from the Class Action Claim. Liberty Puerto Rico
has recorded a provision and a related indemnification asset representing its best estimate of the net loss that it may incur upon
the ultimate resolution of the PRTC Claim. While Liberty Puerto Rico expects that the net amount required to satisfy these
contingencies will not materially differ from the estimated amount it has accrued, no assurance can be given that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in any
given period.

     Belgium Regulatory Developments. In December 2010, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicatie and the regional
regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) published their respective draft decisions
reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium.

     The Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the July 2011 Decision) with some minor
revisions. The regulatory obligations imposed by the July 2011 Decision include (i) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail
minus’’ of the cable analog package available to third party operators (including Proximus), (ii) an obligation to grant third-party
operators (except Proximus) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at “retail minus,”
and (iii) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital
television access obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except
Proximus).

    In February 2012, Telenet submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above, and the Belgium
Regulatory Authorities published the final decision on September 9, 2013. Telenet has implemented the access obligations as
described in its reference offers and, as of June 23, 2014, access to the Telenet network had become operational and can be applied
by wireless operator Mobistar SA (Mobistar). In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of
Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014, Proximus submitted a request to Telenet to commence access negotiations.
Telenet contests this request and has asked the Belgium Regulatory Authorities to assess the reasonableness of the Proximus
request. The timing for a decision regarding this assessment by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities is not known.

      On December 14, 2015, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft decision, which amended previously-issued
decisions, that sets forth the “retail-minus” tariffs of minus 26% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and
minus 18% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services during an initial two-year period. Following this
two-year period, the tariffs would change to minus 15% and 7%, respectively. The draft decision was notified to the European
Commission and a final decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016. A “retail-minus” method of pricing involves a wholesale
tariff calculated as the retail price for the offered service by Telenet, excluding VAT and copyrights, and further deducting the
retail costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing and sales).

     Telenet filed an appeal against the July 2011 Decision with the Brussels Court of Appeal. On November 12, 2014, the Brussels
Court of Appeal rejected Telenet’s appeal of the July 2011 Decision and accepted Proximus’s claim that Proximus should be
allowed access to Telenet’s, among other operators, digital television platform and the resale of bundles of digital video and
broadband internet services. On November 30, 2015, Telenet filed an appeal of this decision with the Belgian Supreme Court. In
2015, Telenet and wireless operator Mobistar each filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the decision regarding
the quantitative aspects of the reference offers. A decision with respect to these appeals is expected during 2016. There can be no
certainty that Telenet’s appeals will be successful.

     The July 2011 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access
to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in
developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (i) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet
to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (ii) adversely impact Telenet’s ability
to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the
extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to Telenet’s network and other competitive factors
or market developments.

     Financial Transactions Tax. Eleven countries in the EU, including Belgium, Germany, Austria and Slovakia, are participating
in an enhanced cooperation procedure to introduce a financial transactions tax (the FTT). Under the draft language of the FTT
proposal, a wide range of financial transactions could be taxed at rates of at least 0.01% for derivative transactions based on the
notional amount and 0.1% for other covered financial transactions based on the underlying transaction price. Each of the individual
countries would be permitted to determine an exact rate, which could be higher than the proposed rates of 0.01% and 0.1%. Any
implementation of the FTT could have a global impact because it would apply to all financial transactions where a financial
institution is involved (including unregulated entities that engage in certain types of covered activity) and either of the parties
(whether the financial institution or its counterparty) is in one of the eleven participating countries. Although ongoing debate in
the relevant countries demonstrates continued momentum around the FTT, uncertainty remains as to when the FTT would be
implemented and the breadth of its application. Based on our understanding of the current status of the potential FTT, we do not
expect that any implementation of the FTT would occur before January 2017. Any imposition of the FTT could increase banking
fees and introduce taxes on internal transactions that we currently perform. Due to the uncertainty regarding the FTT, we are
currently unable to estimate the financial impact that the FTT could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.

     Virgin Media VAT Matters. Virgin Media’s application of VAT with respect to certain revenue generating activities has been
challenged by the U.K. tax authorities. Virgin Media has estimated its maximum exposure in the event of an unfavorable outcome
to be £45.2 million ($66.6 million) as of December 31, 2015. No portion of this exposure has been accrued by Virgin Media as
the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. A court hearing was held at the end of September 2014 in relation to the
U.K. tax authorities’ challenge and the court’s decision is expected prior to March 31, 2016.

    On March 19, 2014, the U.K. government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection
with prompt payment discounts such as those that we offer to our fixed-line telephony customers. This change, which took effect

                                                                II-188

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


on May 1, 2014, impacted our company and some of our competitors. As a result of this legislation, our revenue was $24.0 million
lower during 2015 as compared to 2014. The U.K. tax authority issued a decision in the fourth quarter of 2015 challenging our
application of the prompt payment discount rules prior to the May 1, 2014 change in legislation. We have appealed this decision.
As part of the appeal process, we were required to make aggregate payments of £67.0 million ($99.1 million at the respective
transaction dates), which included the challenged amount of £63.7 million and related interest of £3.3 million. The aggregate
amount paid does not include penalties, which could be significant in the unlikely event that penalties were to be assessed. This
matter will likely be subject to court proceedings that could delay the ultimate resolution for an extended period of time. No portion
of this potential exposure has been accrued by our company as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable.

     Hungary VAT Matter. In September 2015, our DTH operations in Luxembourg received a first instance decision from the
Hungarian tax authorities as a result of an audit with respect to VAT payments that the Hungarian tax authorities conducted for
the years 2010 through 2012. The Hungarian tax authorities have assessed our DTH operations with an obligation to pay VAT for
the years audited of HUF 5,902.2 million ($20.3 million), excluding interest and penalties, which could be significant. We believe
that our DTH operations have operated in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and interpretations thereof, including
a binding tax ruling that we received from the Hungarian government in 2010. Although we are appealing the first instance decision,
we may be required to pay all or a portion of the assessed amount during the pendency of the appeal. No portion of this exposure
has been accrued by us as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable.

     Telenet MVNO Matter. Telenet and Mobistar are currently in dispute over amounts payable to Mobistar with respect to certain
provisions of Telenet’s MVNO agreement with Mobistar (the Mobistar MVNO Agreement). As part of this dispute, Mobistar
initiated legal proceedings against Telenet claiming, among other things, that the migration period after termination or expiration
of the Mobistar MVNO Agreement should be shortened from 24 months to six months. Telenet believes it has strong arguments
against Mobistar’s claims and intends to defend itself vigorously. We cannot currently predict the outcome of these proceedings;
however, in the unlikely event that the migration period is shortened, Telenet’s mobile business could be adversely impacted. The
oral hearing in this matter is currently scheduled for September 23, 2016.

     Other Regulatory Issues. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are
regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some
significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the EU. Adverse regulatory
developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition
or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types
of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may
restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other
access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with
current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties. In this regard, beginning in September 2014, various
decreases to tariff rates have been proposed and implemented by Chilean regulatory authorities, and a further decrease to one tariff
rate is pending. None of these decreases had, or are expected to have, a material impact on VTR’s revenue or expenses.

    We have security accreditations across a range of B2B products and services in order to increase our offerings to public sector
organizations in the U.K. These accreditations are granted subject to periodic reviews of our policies and procedures by U.K.
governmental authorities. If we were to fail to maintain these accreditations or obtain new accreditations when required, it could
impact our ability to provide certain offerings to the public sector.

     In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business
including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving VAT and wage, property and other tax issues and (iii) disputes over
interconnection, programming, copyright and channel carriage fees. While we generally expect that the amounts required to satisfy
these contingencies will not materially differ from any estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that the
resolution of one or more of these contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or
financial position in any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack of
a clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows that might result
from any unfavorable outcomes.

                                              December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013


(18)       Segment Reporting

     We generally identify our reportable segments as those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more of our revenue,
Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets. In certain cases, we may elect to include an operating segment in our segment
disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions
about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. In
addition, we review non-financial measures such as subscriber growth, as appropriate.

     Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA) is the primary measure used by our
chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance. Adjusted OIBDA is also a key factor that is used by
our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our
management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, Adjusted OIBDA is defined as
operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to
significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains and losses
on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and
dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains
and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted OIBDA is a meaningful
measure and is superior to available GAAP measures because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance
that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical
comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different
countries in which we operate. We believe our Adjusted OIBDA measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for
comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may
not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted OIBDA should be viewed as a measure
of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss, cash flow from
operating activities and other GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of total segment Adjusted OIBDA to our
loss from continuing operations before income taxes is presented below.

     We began presenting our operating segment in Puerto Rico as a separate reportable segment during the second quarter of 2015
in anticipation of the issuance of the LiLAC Shares. Previously, this operating segment was included in our corporate and other
category. Segment information for all periods presented reflects the above-described change. We present only the reportable
segments of our continuing operations in the tables below.

       As of December 31, 2015, our reportable segments are as follows:

       •   European Operations Division:
             •   U.K./Ireland
             •   The Netherlands
             •   Germany
             •   Belgium
             •   Switzerland/Austria
             •   Central and Eastern Europe

       •   LiLAC Division:
             • Chile
             • Puerto Rico

     All of the reportable segments set forth above derive their revenue primarily from broadband communications services,
including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services. Most of our reportable segments also provide B2B and
mobile services. At December 31, 2015, our operating segments in the European Operations Division provided broadband
communications services in 12 European countries and DTH services to customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and
Slovakia through a Luxembourg-based organization that we refer to as “UPC DTH.” In addition to UPC DTH, our Central and
Eastern Europe segment includes our broadband communications operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania
and Slovakia. The European Operations Division’s central and other category includes (i) costs associated with certain centralized
functions, including billing systems, network operations, technology, marketing, facilities, finance and other administrative
functions, and (ii) intersegment eliminations within the European Operations Division. The corporate and other category for the
                                                               II-190

Liberty Global Group includes less significant consolidated operating segments that provide programming and other services.
Intersegment eliminations primarily represent the elimination of intercompany transactions between our broadband
communications and programming operations. Inter-group eliminations primarily represent the elimination of intercompany
transactions between the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group.

  Performance Measures of Our Reportable Segments

     The amounts presented below represent 100% of each of our reportable segment’s revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. As we have
the ability to control Telenet and Liberty Puerto Rico, we consolidate 100% of the revenue and expenses of these entities in our
consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that third parties own significant interests in these entities. The noncontrolling
owners’ interests in the operating results of Telenet, Liberty Puerto Rico and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries
are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations.

_______________

(a)     Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
        fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(b)     Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $212.7 million, $245.0 million and $175.2 million
        during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included
        in other revenue.

(c)     B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium
        to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain small or home office
        (SOHO) subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband
        internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our
        residential subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which is included in cable subscription revenue, aggregated
        $321.8 million, $220.7 million and $158.9 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(d)     Other revenue includes, among other items, interconnect, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fee and installation revenue.

(20)    Subsequent Event

     BASE Acquisition. On February 11, 2016, pursuant to a definitive agreement and following regulatory approval, Telenet
acquired BASE for a cash purchase price of €1,324.4 million ($1,500.5 million at the transaction date) (the BASE Acquisition).
BASE is the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium. We expect that the BASE Acquisition will provide Telenet with
cost-effective long-term mobile access to effectively compete for future growth opportunities in the Belgium mobile market. The
BASE Acquisition was funded through a combination of €1.0 billion ($1.1 billion at the transaction date) of new debt facilities
and existing liquidity of Telenet. On February 4, 2016, the European Commission approved Telenet’s acquisition of BASE following
Telenet’s agreement to divest both the JIM Mobile prepaid customer base and BASE’s 50% stake in Viking Co NV to MEDIALAAN
NV, which was announced in November 2015. Information with regard to the acquisition accounting and pro forma effect of the
acquisition of BASE is not yet available.

                                            Notes to Attributed Financial Information
                                               December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013
                                                           (unaudited)


(1)    Attributed Financial Information

      The terms “LiLAC Group” and “Liberty Global Group” do not represent separate legal entities, rather they represent those
businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each group. The LiLAC Group comprises our businesses, assets and
liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed to it (i) VTR Finance and its subsidiaries, which include VTR,
(ii) Lila Chile Holding B.V. (Lila Chile Holding), (iii) LiLAC Holdings and its subsidiaries, which include Liberty Puerto Rico,
(iv) LGE Coral Holdco Limited and its subsidiary, which were formed in anticipation of the acquisition of CWC, and (v) prior to
July 1, 2015, the LiLAC Corporate Costs. Effective July 1, 2015, LiLAC Corporate Costs were transferred to LiLAC Holdings.
The Liberty Global Group comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities not attributed to the LiLAC Group, including Virgin
Media, Ziggo Group Holding, Unitymedia, Telenet, UPC Holding, our corporate entities (excluding the LiLAC Corporate Costs)
and certain other less significant entities. Accordingly, the accompanying attributed financial information for the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group includes the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of the respective entities within
each group. Any business that we may acquire in the future that we do not attribute to the LiLAC Group will be attributed to the
Liberty Global Group.

     Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to either the
Liberty Global Group or the LiLAC Group to the other group, without the approval of any of our shareholders, and may use the
liquidity of one group to fund the liquidity and capital resource requirements of the other group. Accordingly, shareholders may
have difficulty evaluating the future prospects and liquidity and capital resources of each group.

(2)    Income Taxes

     We generally have accounted for income taxes for the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group in the accompanying
attributed financial information on a separate return basis, as adjusted to reflect the consolidated view of the tax asset, liability,
benefit or expense (tax attribute) of each group. Accordingly, except as otherwise noted below, any tax attribute associated with
an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group has been allocated to the Liberty Global Group and any tax attribute associated
with an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group has been allocated to the LiLAC Group.

     Liberty Global owns consolidated interests in a number of entities that are included in combined or consolidated tax returns,
including tax returns in the Netherlands (the Dutch Fiscal Unity), the U.K. (the U.K. Tax Group) and the U.S (the U.S. Tax
Group). Different members of the Liberty Global Group file combined tax returns for the Dutch Fiscal Unity, U.K. tax returns,
where sharing of certain tax attributes is permitted, and consolidated tax returns for the U.S. Tax Group. Certain entities included
in the Dutch Fiscal Unity, the U.K. Tax Group and the U.S. Tax Group are attributed to the LiLAC Group. As a result, we record
inter-group tax allocations to recognize changes in the tax attributes of certain members of the LiLAC Group that are included in
the Dutch Fiscal Unity, the U.K. Tax Group or the U.S. Tax Group. Prior to July 1, 2015, the inter-group tax allocations reflected
in the attributed financial information were not cash settled and were not the subject of tax sharing agreements. Accordingly, inter-
group tax allocations prior to July 1, 2015 are reflected in the attributed financial information as adjustments of equity. Following
the adoption of the tax sharing policy described below, certain inter-group tax allocations are expected to be cash settled.

     Effective July 1, 2015 (the date we distributed the LiLAC Shares), the allocation of tax attributes between the Liberty Global
Group and the LiLAC Group is based on a tax sharing policy. This tax sharing policy, which may be changed in future periods at
the discretion of the board of directors of Liberty Global, generally results in the allocation of Liberty Global’s tax attributes to
the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group based on the tax attributes of the legal entities attributed to each of the groups.
Nevertheless, to the extent that Liberty Global management concludes that the actions or results of one group give rise to changes
in the tax attributes of the other group, the change in those tax attributes are generally allocated to the group whose actions or
results gave rise to such changes. Similarly, in cases where legal entities in one group join in a common tax filing with members
of the other group, changes in the tax attributes of the group that includes the filing entity that are the result of the actions or
financial results of one or more members of the other group are allocated to the group that does not include the filing entity. In
addition, the allocation of any taxes and losses resulting from the ultimate tax treatment of Liberty Global tax attributes related to
the distribution of the LiLAC Shares are allocated in proportion to each group’s respective number of “liquidation units.” Liquidation
units were allocated to each Liberty Global Share and each LiLAC Share, respectively, in proportion to the relative market value
of a Class C Liberty Global Share and a Class C LiLAC Share, respectively, based on their respective volume-weighted average
price over the 20 trading-day period commencing shortly after the commencement of ordinary-course (regular-way) trading of the
LiLAC Shares. Pursuant to the terms of our articles of association, the liquidation units for each Liberty Global Share and each
LiLAC Share are 1 and 0.94893, respectively. For periods beginning on and after July 1, 2015, we will record non-interest bearing
inter-group payables and receivables in connection with the allocation of tax attributes. These inter-group payables and receivables
                                                                 F-15
                                                                 LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC

                                                                        (unaudited)

are expected to be cash settled annually within 90 days following the filing of the relevant tax return to the extent that amounts
are due to or from the tax authority for the taxable year covered by the applicable return. In the case of allocated tax assets, inter-
group payables and receivables will only be recorded to the extent that the realization by the ultimate tax-paying entity is considered
to be more-likely-than-not. At December 31, 2015, we do not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the tax
assets of the Dutch Fiscal Unity.

(a)       Includes federal and state income taxes. Our U.S. state income taxes were not material during any of the years presented.

(b)       The amounts include (i) inter-group current tax expense of the U.S. Tax Group of $2.1 million during the six months ended
          December 31, 2015 and (ii) inter-group deferred tax expense of the U.S. Tax Group of $1.5 million during the six months

(a)       The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 20.0%, 21.0% and 23.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(b)       Country jurisdictions giving rise to increases are grouped together and shown separately from country jurisdictions giving
          rise to decreases.

(c)       In November 2015, it was announced that the U.K. corporate income tax rate will change from the current rate of 20.0%
          to 19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020. The impact of these rate changes on our deferred tax balances was recorded

(a)        The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 20.0%, 21.0% and 23.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
           In November 2015, it was announced that the U.K. corporate income tax rate will change from the current rate of 20.0%
           to 19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020.

(b)        Country jurisdictions giving rise to increases are grouped together and shown separately from country jurisdictions giving
           rise to decreases.

(c)        The 2014 amount represents the impact of income tax rate changes in Chile, as further described below.

(d)        Amounts reflect adjustments (either an increase or a decrease) to “expected” tax benefit for statutory rates in jurisdictions
           in which we operate outside of the U.K.

        The current and non-current components of our deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

  Chilean Tax Law Changes

     On September 26, 2014, the Chilean President signed an extensive tax reform bill, including changes to the corporate tax rate,
changes to the thin capitalization rules, taxation of certain Chilean investments abroad and changes to the stamp tax rate, among
other relevant changes. The bill became law on September 29, 2014. The impacts of the tax law changes that are currently in effect
are reflected in the attributed financial information. Accordingly, the corporate tax rate for 2015 is 22.5% and will increase during
2016 to 24%. Beginning in 2017, there will be two income tax regimes: the “attributed system” and the “partially integrated
system.” Under the “partially integrated system,” which our Chilean operations will be required to use based on legislation that
was enacted on February 1, 2016, the corporate tax rate will be 25.5% in 2017 and 27% in 2018 and future years, and the 35%
withholding tax will be paid only upon actual distributions to shareholders. However, under this partially integrated system, only
65% of the corporate tax paid by a Chilean company can be used as a credit against the withholding tax imposed on non-Chilean
resident shareholders, which implies a final tax burden of 44.45%. In the case of shareholders resident in countries that have tax
treaties in force with Chile, there will be a full credit for the corporate tax paid, which implies a final tax burden of 35% for such
shareholders. Currently, there are no tax treaties between Chile and the U.S.
                                                                                             F-21

                                              December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013

(3)   Allocated Expenses

     Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not allocate any of the costs of the Liberty Global Group’s corporate functions to the LiLAC
Group. Following the July 1, 2015 distribution of the LiLAC Shares, we began to allocate a portion of these costs, excluding share-
based compensation expense, to the LiLAC Group based primarily on the estimated percentage of time spent by corporate personnel
providing services for each group. The allocated amount, which will be re-evaluated periodically and which we expect to cash
settle, is presented as inter-group fees and allocations in the attributed statement of operations information. The portion of the
Liberty Global Group’s corporate costs that will be allocated to the LiLAC Group during the first twelve months following the
distribution of the LiLAC Shares will be $8.5 million.

     The share-based compensation expense reflected in the accompanying attributed statement of operations information is based
on the share incentive awards held by the employees of the respective entities comprising the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC
Group.

    The income tax benefit and expense of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group includes inter-group tax allocations.
For additional information concerning our inter-group tax allocations, see note 2 to this attributed financial information.

     While we believe that our allocation methodologies are reasonable, we may elect to change these allocation methodologies
or the percentages used to allocate operating and SG&A expenses in the future.

(4)   Inter-group Transactions

  Inter-group Interests

     On November 16, 2015, we announced the terms of our proposed acquisition of CWC. Following completion of the acquisition
of CWC, we intend to attribute CWC to the LiLAC Group, with the Liberty Global Group being granted an inter-group interest
in the LiLAC Group. Based on the fully-diluted numbers of Liberty Global Shares, LiLAC Shares and CWC shares outstanding
on November 16, 2015, after giving effect to the acquisition and such attribution, and treating the Liberty Global Group’s inter-
group interest in the LiLAC Group as being represented by additional LiLAC Shares, Liberty Global Group shareholders would
have had an approximate 67.4% ownership interest in the LiLAC Group.

  Capital Contributions

    On June 30, 2015, an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group made a $100.0 million cash capital contribution to LiLAC
Holdings in order to provide liquidity to fund, among other things, the LiLAC Group’s ongoing operating costs and acquisitions.

     On June 3, 2015, in connection with the Choice Acquisition, an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group made a $10.2
million cash capital contribution to an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group to partially fund the purchase price for Choice.

  Lila Chile Note

     On July 11, 2014, Lila Chile Holding and Liberty Global Holding B.V. (Liberty Global Holding), an entity attributed to the
Liberty Global Group, entered into a loan agreement (the Lila Chile Note). At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Liberty Global
Holding owed Lila Chile Holding $1.1 million and $9.4 million, respectively, in principal pursuant to the Lila Chile Note. The
Lila Chile Note bears interest at 5.9% per annum and has a repayment date of July 11, 2022. The principal and accrued interest
on the Lila Chile Note are included in other assets, net, in the attributed balance sheet information. Accrued and unpaid interest is
generally transferred to the principal balance on January 1 of each year. The net decrease in the Lila Chile Note during 2015
includes (i) cash repayments of $10.0 million, (ii) cash loans of $1.4 million and (iii) the transfer of $0.3 million in non-cash
accrued interest to the principal balance. The net increase in the Lila Chile Note during 2014 includes (a) cash loans of $56.3
million and (b) cash repayments of $46.9 million.

  VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes

     On January 24, 2014, VTR Finance issued the VTR Finance Senior Secured Notes. The use of proceeds from the VTR Finance
Senior Secured Notes to repay debt of UPC Holding has been reflected as a non-cash transaction in this attributed financial
information.

  Related-party Advance

     During 2013, VTR Chile Holdings SpA (VTR Chile Holdings), an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group, made a $600.0
million non-interest bearing advance to UPC Holding, which was repaid in full during 2014. This advance is reflected in inter-
group receipts (payments), net, in the attributed statement of cash flows information. The proceeds received from the repayment
of this advance were used to fund (i) the $435.1 million consideration paid by VTR Chile Holdings to acquire the VTR NCI
Owner’s 20.0% ownership interests in VTR and VTR Wireless SpA, (ii) a $128.5 million distribution to an entity attributed to the
Liberty Global Group, which represented a return of capital, and (iii) the settlement of certain derivative instruments of VTR.

  UPC Broadband France Loan

     The UPC Broadband France Loan, as amended, represented amounts owed by VTR to UPC Broadband France SAS (UPC
Broadband France), an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group. The UPC Broadband France Loan bore interest at the
Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the UPC Broadband France Loan agreement) plus 2.0%. In January 2014, a parent of UPC Broadband
France made a capital contribution in the amount of $444.9 million to the parent of VTR, which was used to acquire the corresponding
loan receivable from UPC Broadband France and pay related accrued interest. Accordingly, the UPC Broadband France Loan was
effectively settled within the LiLAC Group. The cash outflow related to Liberty Global Group’s capital contribution has been
reflected in inter-group receipts (payments), net, in financing activities in the attributed statement of cash flows information and
the cash inflow to the Liberty Global Group related to the sale of the loan receivable has been reflected in inter-group receipts, net
in investing activities in the attributed statement of cash flows information. The cash effects of these transactions for the LiLAC
Group are reflected in inter-group receipts (payments), net, in financing activities in the attributed statement of cash flows
information. During 2014 and 2013, VTR incurred related-party interest expense on the UPC Broadband France Loan of $0.3
million and $11.1 million, respectively.

  UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan

     Prior to December 31, 2011, Liberty Global Europe, an entity attributed to the Liberty Global Group, had loaned an aggregate
of $99.4 million (the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan) to an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group. The interest rate on the
UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan was 9.39% in 2013. In January 2014, the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan was settled
through a non-cash capital contribution by Liberty Global Europe to an entity attributed to the LiLAC Group. During 2014 and
2013, VTR incurred related-party interest expense on the UPC Chile Mobile Shareholder Loan of $0.3 million and $10.4 million,
respectively.
