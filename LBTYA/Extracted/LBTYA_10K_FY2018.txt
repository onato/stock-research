Item 1. BUSINESS

Who We Are

     We are Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global), an international television and broadband company. We are focused on building
a strong convergence of fixed and mobile communication opportunities and we are constantly striving to enhance and simplify
our customers’ lives through quality services and products that give them the freedom to connect, converse, work and be entertained
anytime, anywhere they choose.

     Liberty Global has consolidated operations in 10 European countries serving 21.2 million customers in Europe at December 31,
2018. Our primary business operations are listed below, all of which we consolidate, with the exception of the VodafoneZiggo JV
(defined below). As described below, our operations in Germany, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic, as well as our DTH
(defined below) operations, were held for sale at December 31, 2018. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement to sell
our operations in Switzerland as stated below.

General Development of Business

     As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent
company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin
Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global
(or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated,
convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2018, and operational data, including
subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2018.

  Expansion and Acquisitions

     We have expanded our broadband footprint through new build projects and strategically selected acquisitions. Our new build
projects consist of network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband
communications network (Network Extensions). Our investment in Network Extensions is critical not only for our business to
grow, but also for the countries and communities in which we operate. The Network Extensions, together with upgrades to our
existing networks and next generation customer premises equipment, provide our customers the means to enter the gigaworld
society. During 2018, through our Network Extensions, our continuing operations connected approximately 657,000 additional
residential and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks, including approximately 481,000 residential
and commercial premises connected by Virgin Media in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Ireland. We expect to continue the
Network Extensions in 2019. Depending on a variety of factors, however, including the financial and operations results of our
new build programs, the Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion.


                                                                I-1
     Over the past five years, we have also completed several strategic acquisitions. We made these acquisitions in order to deliver
the scale that allows us to innovate effectively and invest in great content and the best products. This enables us to deliver quality
services to our customers. Our significant acquisitions include:

    •    On June 19, 2017, Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet) acquired Coitel Brabant sprl, operating under the brand name
         SFR BeLux (SFR BeLux), which provided broadband operations in Belgium (Brussels and Wallonia) and Luxembourg.
    •    On May 16, 2016, we acquired Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (C&W), a provider of telecommunication
         services, including mobile and high-speed broadband, focused in Latin America and the Caribbean. In connection with
         the Split-off Transaction referenced below under —Dispositions, we transferred C&W to Liberty Latin America Ltd.
         (Liberty Latin America).
    •    On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired BASE Company N.V. (BASE), the third-largest mobile network operator in
         Belgium.
    •    On June 3, 2015, we acquired, together with investment funds affiliated with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P., Choice
         Cable TV, a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico, which was integrated into the operations of Liberty
         Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC. In connection with the Split-off Transaction referenced below under —Dispositions,
         we transferred Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC to Liberty Latin America.
    •    In November 2014, we gained control of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo), a provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-
         line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands, and integrated Ziggo into our Netherlands broadband operations.
         This business was contributed to form the VodafoneZiggo JV (defined below), a 50:50 joint venture, on December 31,
         2016.

   For additional information on our acquisitions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have completed various other smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.

  Dispositions

    We have completed the following dispositions during the past five years:

    •    On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our Austrian operations (UPC Austria) to Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche
         Telekom). In connection with the sale of UPC Austria, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Deutsche
         Telekom for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related
         functions.
    •    On December 29, 2017, we effected the split-off of our LiLAC Group by distributing 100% of the common shares of
         Liberty Latin America to holders of our then LiLAC ordinary shares. The “LiLAC Group” consisted of our businesses,
         assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, including C&W, VTR.com SpA, a 60% interest in Liberty
         Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC and related cash and cash equivalents and indebtedness. Following such distribution,
         the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (with virtually no economic rights) and subsequently canceled.
         Also, Liberty Latin America became a separate publicly traded company.
    •    On December 31, 2016, our company and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) contributed our respective operations in the
         Netherlands to VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., a 50:50 joint venture (referred to herein as the VodafoneZiggo JV).
         We treat the VodafoneZiggo JV as an equity investment.
    •    On January 31, 2014, we sold substantially all of our programming interest held through Chellomedia B.V.
     For additional information on our more recent dispositions, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in
Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have also completed various other smaller dispositions in the normal course of
business and as required by regulatory authorities in connection with approving the BASE and Ziggo acquisitions.

  Pending Dispositions

     On May 9, 2018, we reached an agreement (the Vodafone Agreement) to sell our operations in Germany, Romania, Hungary
and the Czech Republic to Vodafone. The cash proceeds that we receive from the transaction will be calculated on the basis of the
agreed enterprise value adjusted for the net debt and working capital of such businesses as of the closing date of the transaction,
as well as other post-closing adjustments. Based on the net debt and working capital of such businesses as of December 31, 2017,
the cash proceeds would be approximately €10.6 billion ($12.1 billion). The operations of Germany, Romania, Hungary and the
Czech Republic are collectively referred to herein as the “Vodafone Disposal Group.” As a result of the Vodafone Agreement,


                                                                 I-2
the Vodafone Disposal Group is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods.
Unless otherwise noted, the below discussion of our business focuses on our continuing operations.

     Closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including regulatory approval, which we expect will be obtained
in mid-2019. The Vodafone Agreement contains certain termination rights for both our company and Vodafone, including if closing
has not occurred by November 9, 2019, or May 9, 2020, in certain limited circumstances. If the Vodafone Agreement terminates
because the condition to obtain antitrust approval is not met, Vodafone has agreed to pay us a compensatory payment of €250.0
million ($286.3 million). In connection with the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group, we have agreed to provide certain transitional
services for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions.

    In addition to the Vodafone Agreement, we recently entered into an agreement to sell our direct-to-home satellite (DTH)
operations, which serves customers in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania (UPC DTH). This transaction is
expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to regulatory approval.

     On February 27, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our broadband operations in Switzerland (UPC Switzerland) to
Sunrise Communications Group AG (Sunrise). Closing of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, which is expected
prior to year-end 2019, and approval by shareholders of Sunrise with respect to an associated capital increase.

     For additional information on the above pending dispositions, see notes 6 and 21 to our consolidated financial statements
included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on the operations of the Vodafone Disposal Group, see
Narrative Description of Business—Discontinued Operations below.

Narrative Description of Business

     We are a leading international telecommunications company with a commitment to providing our customers the “best in class”
communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers over our
networks and include video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services. We deliver mobile services over our own networks
and through third-party networks as MVNOs. We design our services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their
own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer is “triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled
services of digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to
include mobile services for a “quad-play” or fixed-mobile convergence service in most of our markets. Available service offerings
depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. In certain
markets, we also offer video services through fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks.

     Our continuing operations provide residential and business telecommunication services in the U.K. and Ireland through Virgin
Media, Belgium through Telenet, and Switzerland, Poland and Slovakia through our subsidiary UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding).
In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of these countries. We also have investments in the
VodafoneZiggo JV, which operates the largest cable network in the Netherlands, and in various content businesses. In addition,
we currently own and manage the operations of the Vodafone Disposal Group, consisting of television and broadband services in
Germany through Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia) and in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic through UPC Holding,
and the DTH operations under UPC DTH.

    A breakdown of our revenue by major category for our consolidated reportable segments appears in note 19 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      In connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate citizen
and that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address these issues,
we strengthen our company and positively influence the communities in which we operate. This includes enhancing the energy
efficiency of all our operations, with a focus on energy use, carbon emissions and management of electronic waste. We also
recognize that coding skills are essential to our industry and other technology-based jobs of the future. As a result, we have partnered
with the CoderDojo Foundation, a global community of free coding clubs for children age 7-17. Our support for CoderDojo is
enabling the next generation of creators, improving their long-term career prospects. We are also working with European Schoolnet
to raise awareness of teachers on educational resources available for them to help address online issues teenagers are facing.
Corporate responsibility is a key part of our business.

__________________
  (1)    Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without
         materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that
         can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. Due to the fact
         that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 10 below), we do not report homes passed for
         Switzerland’s partner networks.

  (2)    Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way
         services, including video, internet and telephony services.

  (3)    Cable Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that
         we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Cable Customer
         Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises
         (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Cable Customer Relationships. We exclude
         mobile-only customers from Cable Customer Relationships.

  (4)    RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber
         (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs.
         For example, if a residential customer in our U.K. market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and
         broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH,
         Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count
         as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a
         primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony
         service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are
         counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their
         free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally
         are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard,
         our December 31, 2018 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

 (5)     Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
         broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service
         that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or
         virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. We count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words,
         a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our
         video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. In Europe, we have approximately 194,600 “lifeline” customers that are counted
         on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.

 (6)     Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our
         broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that
         requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers are counted on a unique premises basis. For example,
         a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber.
         An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video
         services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers
         to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks receive basic video services from the
         partner networks as opposed to our operations.

 (7)     DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast
         directly via a geosynchronous satellite.

 (8)     Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks,
         or that we service through a partner network. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video
         Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 76,300 subscribers who have
         requested and received this service.

 (9)     Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks,
         or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. In Switzerland, we offer
         a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers
         in Switzerland include 149,500 subscribers who have requested and received this service.

 (10)    Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned
         by third-party cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship
         with the customer. At December 31, 2018, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 126,200 Customer Relationships, 298,400
         RGUs, 107,000 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 109,000 Internet Subscribers, and 82,400 Telephony Subscribers.

  (11)   Our Mobile Subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service rather than
         services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile
                                                                      I-8
          Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle)
          would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile
          Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country.
          In a number of countries, our Mobile Subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2018,
          our Mobile Subscriber count included 489,400 and 376,700 prepaid Mobile Subscribers in Belgium and the U.K., respectively.

Additional General Notes to Table:

        Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services.
        Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive
        enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products
        offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service
        levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations,
        with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing
        customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers
        will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we
        generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

        In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the
        street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as
        needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These
        tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks.

        While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance
        sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform,
        (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We
        periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported
        on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those
        reviews.

        Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such
        information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Products and Services

  Video Services

     Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the key foundations of our product offerings in our markets. Our cable
operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to
our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and receive digital or analog video channels (including a limited number of high
definition (HD) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels and an electronic programming guide. In Poland where
our basic digital service is unencrypted, the cost of our digital service is the same cost as the monthly fee of our analog service.
In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to
or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based
on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements.

    We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly
charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio
channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to
one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge. Our channel offerings include general entertainment,
sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels.

     Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. We offer limited analog
video services in all of our broadband markets, except in the U.K. and Switzerland. In all of our broadband operations, we continue
to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a basic digital or premium
digital service.

    Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services
(bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist
of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services.

     To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with various products that enable our customers to control
when, where and how they watch their programming. These products range from digital video recorders (DVRs) to multimedia
home gateway systems such as "Horizon TV", as well as various mobile applications (apps). Horizon TV is a next generation
multimedia home gateway (decoder box) based on a digital television platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and
data content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view and
share, across multiple devices, linear channels, video-on-demand (VoD) programming and personal media content and to pause,
replay and record programming. The Horizon TV gateway can act as an internet router that allows access to digital video content
available on the television via other devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets.

     In 2018, we introduced our latest set top box, often referred to by its project name “Eos”, in Switzerland. The Eos set top box
is capable of delivering ultra-high definition 4K and enhanced high dynamic range or HDR video content. It carries the next
generation Horizon TV user interface that we call “Horizon 4”. Horizon 4 is a multiscreen platform that combines linear television,
VoD and mobile viewing. In addition to the features of Horizon TV, Horizon 4 allows customers to pause a program, series or
movie and seamlessly continue watching from where they left off on another device, whether a television, tablet, smart phone or
laptop. Customers also have access to cloud storage for up to 2,000 hours of recording, as well as our Repay TV service (described
below). Customers can control their Eos set-top box with voice commands using the accompanying remote control. Horizon 4 is
marketed under the name “UPC TV” in Switzerland, and it will be launched in other markets over the course of 2019, where it
will be marketed under different brand names.

     For our Horizon TV and Horizon 4 subscribers, we offer various features and functionalities, including television apps for
various online services (such as YouTube, Netflix, social platforms, sports experience, music, news and games). In almost all of
our operations, we also offer an online mobile app for viewing on a second screen that is based on our “Horizon Go” platform.
Horizon Go is available on mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows) and via an internet portal and allows video customers to
view linear channels, VoD and Replay TV, with a substantial part of this content available outside of the home. In a number of
markets, Horizon Go also has a “Download to Go” feature that allows the consumer to take content with them on their device.
For Horizon TV and Horizon 4 customers, when in the home the second screen device can act as a remote control. Through Horizon
Go, customers have the ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon TV or Horizon 4 box
at home.

    We offer Horizon TV in Switzerland, Ireland and Poland. In most of our other European operations, we provide a Horizon
TV-like experience through a remotely upgraded version of the software on the customer’s set-top box. After the upgrade, these
boxes offer several features of the Horizon TV product. We refer to this upgrade as “Horizon Lite”, although it is locally marketed
                                                                I-12
as Horizon TV, except in Belgium where it is marketed as “Digital TV”. Some of the Horizon TV features are not available on
our Horizon Lite systems, such as recommendation-based content and the ability to access video content on other devices in the
home. We intend to continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software updates.

    In the U.K., we offer a multimedia home gateway based on the TiVo platform under a strategic partnership agreement with
TiVo Inc. Through the TiVo platform, we offer our U.K. customers a basic set-top box or the Virgin Media V6 box. Both boxes
provide television and broadband internet capabilities. Similar to Horizon 4, the Virgin Media V6 box combines ultra high-definition
4K video, including high dynamic range, with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media
V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh. Customers can also start watching
programming on one television and pick up where they left off on other TiVo boxes in another room or through an app on their
smart phones and tablets. Over 50% of our U.K. customers have the Virgin Media V6 box. In addition to the video service on their
TiVo gateway device, our customers in the U.K. also have access to a comprehensive internet streaming video service called
“Virgin TV Go”. This service, which is available via a mobile app or an internet portal, allows our video customers to stream real-
time TV channels and watch VoD content anywhere they have an internet connection. Our enhanced video customers can also
download certain on-demand programs to their compatible devices for off-line viewing via the Virgin TV Go app.

     In Belgium, Telenet is planning to deploy Horizon 4 in 2019, as well as an enhanced multiscreen service based on Horizon
Go. Its current digital video product “Digital TV” functions similar to our Horizon Lite service. Telenet also offers customers
access to live TV streaming and various other content sources such as VoD via its “Yelo Play” app, which is available via iOS,
Android and Windows smart phones and tablets. Digital TV set-top boxes and Yelo Play offer a Horizon TV-like user interface
that allow Telenet's enhanced video customers to remotely manage their DVR, view programs remotely (up to seven days after
the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or tablet in or out of the home.

     One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Replay TV records virtually all programs across numerous linear channels in
the countries where this service is available. The recordings are available up to seven days after the original broadcast. This allows
our customers to catch up on their favorite television shows without having to set their DVR or browse separate menus on their
set-top boxes. Instead, customers can open the electronic programing guide, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly.
Replay TV also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Replay
TV is one of the most used and appreciated features on our platforms. It is accessible in all of our markets, except in the U.K.,
through our Horizon services, and in some of our markets also via Horizon Go.

     In most of our markets, we offer transactional VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In
several of our markets, our subscription VoD service is included in our enhanced video services accessed through the Horizon TV
platform. This service is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers
and includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and TV series. In Belgium, the service is
marketed as “Play” and “Play More”. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming
from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Discovery, the
BBC, Warner and Sony, among others. Customers who subscribe to an extended digital tier generally receive a VoD enabled set-
top box without an additional monthly charge.

     Subscribers access our enhanced video service by renting a set-top box with a smart card from our operators, or without a
set-top box if a subscriber is only using our basic video service. Where Horizon TV is available, a subscriber to our enhanced
video services has the option, for an incremental monthly charge, to upgrade the standard digital set-top box to a Horizon TV box
or Horizon 4 for our Switzerland customers (both of which have HD DVR capabilities and other additional features). No set-top
box or smart card, however, is required to receive our basic digital services in our unencrypted footprint in Poland. In addition,
expanded channel packages and premium channels and services are available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.

  WiFi and Internet Services

     Connectivity is a building block for vibrant communities. Our fiber-rich broadband network is the backbone of our business
and the basis of our connectivity strategy. To meet our customers’ expectations to be seamlessly connected, we are investing in
the expansion of our broadband network, mobile and WiFi solutions and customer premises equipment.

     Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy
services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our
markets. Our residential subscribers access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly
via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 50 Mbps in
Slovakia to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Switzerland, Poland and Slovakia.


                                                                I-13
     The speed of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. In addition, by leveraging our existing fiber-
rich broadband networks and our Network Extensions, we are in position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation
DOCSIS 3.1 technology. In 2018, we launched this technology in Warsaw, Poland. Customers in Warsaw may subscribe to our
ultra high-speed internet service of 1 Gbps. We intend to expand this technology in additional markets in 2019. By using DOCSIS
3.1, we can extend our download speeds to at least 1 Gbps where deployed. DOCSIS 3.1 technology improves not only our internet
speed offers but also to allows for network growth. DOCSIS technology is an international standard that defines the requirements
for data transmission over a cable system. Currently, our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.0
technology.

     Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. We offer value-added broadband services
in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and
spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. In many of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services with
internet access as described below. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In
addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee
may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of
speed, market conditions and other factors.

     Our "Connect Box" is a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior in-home WiFi coverage. It is our next generation
WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable
wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. It has an automatic WiFi optimization function, which selects the best possible
wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi
service. Our Connect Box is available in all our markets and currently over 60% of our customers have a Connect Box. In addition
to our markets, we distribute Connect Box to other markets in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, connecting almost 12
million homes. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using
bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. In Belgium, Switzerland and the U.K., we also offer a connect app that allows our
customers to find their best WiFi access. In addition, WiFi boosters are available in all our markets to optimize connectivity. We
are also moving forward to bring to market our new Gigabit Connect Box based on DOCSIS 3.1 technology that will provide even
better in-home WiFi service to customers.

     In all of our markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides a
secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem)
in the Connect Box, the set-top box or a Horizon box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the
sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. The public channel is a separate network from
the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed.
Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public places) are also available for no
additional cost.

  Mobile Services

     Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. We offer mobile
services as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Switzerland, Ireland and Poland. Following the February 2016
acquisition of BASE, Telenet became a mobile network provider in Belgium. Where appropriate, we will add MVNO arrangements
or acquire or partner with mobile service providers with their own networks in all our broadband communication markets.

     In Switzerland and Ireland, we provide our mobile telephony services as full MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party
mobile network operator in their respective footprints of our country operations. These operations lease the third-party’s radio
access network and own the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. These arrangements permit us to
offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. In 2017,
our mobile operations in the U.K. moved from a light MVNO to a full MVNO arrangement due to a revised agreement with the
third-party network provider. The migration of our U.K. mobile customers to the full MVNO arrangement is expected to be
completed in 2019. In Poland, we provide mobile telephony as a light MVNO to certain legacy subscribers. In this case, we lease
the core network as well as the radio access network from a mobile network operator. This arrangement permits our Poland
customers to have access to the third-party mobile communications services while we maintain the customer relationship. We plan
to launch a new mobile service in Poland as a full MVNO in mid-2019.

Poland                                                                                                     Orange/Play
____________
(1) Our Switzerland operations migrated to the Swisscom AG (Swisscom) network the beginning of 2019.

     Where mobile services are available, subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is
combined with our cable services or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. We offer our customers
the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in most of our markets, make such purchase pursuant to a contract independent of
their mobile services contract. We refer to these arrangements as split contracts. In Belgium, for those subscribers on Telenet’s
own network, it is offering more flexible bundles adjusted to customers’ needs so they can use the full capacity of their package,
regardless of their appetite to use either more data, minutes or text messages. As a mobile network provider, Telenet also has
agreements with other mobile providers to use its mobile network for their mobile offerings.

     Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and out
of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily on a postpaid
basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months (or
36 months in the U.K.), with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium and Switzerland, however, our
postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K. and Belgium, we also offer a prepaid service, where the
customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost
all of our markets, subscribers to a double- or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee.

  Telephony Services

     Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in most of our
broadband communication markets. In the U.K., we also provide traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay
interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive
similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points.

     Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination
with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and
various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited
off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a
personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost.

  Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks

     Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium
(the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its
services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship
with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to
use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on
September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional
information on the PICs Agreement, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

     For over half of the basic video subscribers of UPC Switzerland, UPC Switzerland maintains billing relationships with landlords
or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing
for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-
play bundles with or without mobile service from UPC Switzerland, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.

     UPC Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of
those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC Switzerland. UPC Switzerland has the direct customer
billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC Switzerland to offer some or all of its enhanced video, broadband

                                                                I-15
internet and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland’s service operating contracts have
expanded the addressable markets for UPC Switzerland’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products
directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from
those subscribers. UPC Switzerland also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its
partner networks.

  Business Services

    In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our operations. For business and public sector
organizations, we provide a complete range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile
and converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business
and medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators.

     Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services,
including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories:

    •    VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options;
    •    data services for internet access, virtual private networks and high capacity point-to-point services;
    •    wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;
    •    video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries; and
    •    value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled software.

    Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a
preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.

     Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of
services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market
prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more
advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers,
we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year.

  Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV

     We own a 50% interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which is a leading Dutch company that provides fixed, mobile and integrated
communication and entertainment services to consumers and businesses in the Netherlands. In connection with the formation of
the VodafoneZiggo JV, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Vodafone providing for the governance of the VodafoneZiggo
JV, including decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. It also provides for
restrictions on transfer of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and exit arrangements. Under the dividend policy, the VodafoneZiggo
JV is required to distribute all unrestricted cash to Vodafone and us, subject to minimum cash requirements and financing
arrangements. We also entered into a framework agreement with the VodafoneZiggo JV to provide access to each partner’s expertise
in the telecommunications business. For additional information on the above agreements, see note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The fiber-rich broadband network of the VodafoneZiggo JV passes 7.2 million homes. The VodafoneZiggo JV also offers
nationwide mobile coverage. At December 31, 2018, the VodafoneZiggo JV had 9.7 million RGUs of which 3.9 million were
video, 3.3 million were fixed broadband internet and 2.5 million were fixed-line telephony. In addition, the VodafoneZiggo JV
had 5.0 million mobile (including 0.8 million prepaid) customers. Besides its residential services, the VodafoneZiggo JV offers
extensive business services throughout the Netherlands. The operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV are subject to various regulations,
which are described below under Regulatory Matters—The Netherlands.

     The VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers continue to have access to Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as “Ziggo TV”),
including Replay TV, the Ziggo Go app, pause live TV and VoD, 400 Mbps nationwide broadband internet and an extensive WiFi
Community network. The VodafoneZiggo JV also has its own sports channel, Ziggo Sport, and offers exclusive programming,
such as HBO. Approximately 1.2 million customers use the Connect Box for their in-home WiFi service. They also have access
to Vodafone’s nationwide long-term evolution wireless service, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services, under either
a prepaid or postpaid service plan. The VodafoneZiggo JV provides its mobile services under various licenses. The license for its
3G services expires in 2020. The bandwidth under this license will be re-auctioned in late 2019. With its mobile services, the
VodafoneZiggo JV is able to offer quad-play bundles and converged services to its residential and business customers.

                                                               I-16
     For all its services, the VodafoneZiggo JV competes primarily with the provision of similar services from the incumbent
telecommunications operator Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (1) internet protocol television (IPTV) over fiber optic
lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is
referred to herein as FTTx) and through broadband internet connections using digital subscriber lines (DSL) or very high-speed
DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (2) digital terrestrial television (DTT), and (3) LTE
services. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of up to 200 Mbps and
on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Its ability to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband
internet and telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services creates significant competitive pressure on the
VodafoneZiggo JV’s operations, including the pricing and bundling of its video products. KPN’s video services include many of
the interactive features that the VodafoneZiggo JV offers its subscribers, including pausing live TV, replay and third party apps.
Portions of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion
of these networks is expected to continue. Another significant competitor is the Netherlands operations of Deutsche Telekom.

  Discontinued Operations

    We currently own and manage the Vodafone Disposal Group operations (Germany, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic).
On May 9, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Vodafone pursuant to which Vodafone would acquire the Vodafone Disposal
Group, subject to various conditions. We expect the disposition of the Vodafone Disposal Group to be completed in mid-2019 and,
accordingly, we have reported it as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Below is a description of the Vodafone
Disposal Group business in 2018.

     The Vodafone Disposal Group consists of, in terms of video subscribers, the largest cable network in each of the Czech
Republic and Hungary and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania. In each of these operations, the
core offer is triple-play services. Customers who subscribe to triple play services or double-play services receive a discount to
their monthly service fees. The broadband network of the Vodafone Disposal Group passes 19.7 million homes. The operations
in Germany and Hungary also offer mobile services. In addition to the residential services, each of the operations in the Vodafone
Disposal Group offers business services in their respective countries.

     The Vodafone Disposal Group cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting
with a basic video service. In each market, the basic digital service is unencrypted. Extended digital tiers are available for an
additional monthly charge and include additional video and radio channels, including those in the basic tier services, and additional
HD channels. Vodafone Disposal Group customers have access to Horizon TV or Horizons Lite, depending on location, Horizon
Go and, except in Germany, Replay TV. The operations have an extensive WiFi Community network, and the maximum broadband
speeds available are 400 Mbps in Germany and 500Mbps in the other countries. In addition, up to 1 Gbps is available in select
cities of Germany. Through MVNO arrangements, customers in Germany and Hungary have access to LTE services and postpaid
service plans. With these mobile services, the German and Hungarian operations are able to offer quad-play bundles and converged
services to residential and business customers.

     Approximately two-thirds of Unitymedia’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia has the billing
relationship with the landlord or housing association or with a third-party (Professional Operator) that operates and administers
the in-building network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements, such as the one with Tele Columbus
Multimedia GmbH, allow Unitymedia to market its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to
the Professional Operator’s subscriber base. Professional Operators may procure the basic video signals from Unitymedia at
volume-based discounts and will generally resell them to housing associations with whom the operator maintains the customer
relationship.

     Unitymedia has entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche
Telekom for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as use of fiber optic transmission systems, towers and facility space.
In addition, Unitymedia purchases a portion of the electricity required for the operation of its networks through Deutsche Telekom
under such agreements. Unitymedia’s ability to offer its broadband communications services to customers is dependent on the
agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions.
Any termination, however, would have a material adverse effect on the operations of Unitymedia. For information on a legal action
that Unitymedia commenced against Deutsche Telekom’s affiliate in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 18 to
our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




                                                                I-17
Additional Business Information

  Technology

     In most of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber
coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the
home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. Over 99% of our network allows for two-way communications and is
flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services.

     We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for
instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies
that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:

    •    recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:
                  increasing the number of nodes in our markets;
                  increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;
                  converting analog channels to digital;
                  bonding additional DOCSIS 3.0 channels;
                  replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and
                  using digital compression technologies.
    •    freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to
         digital services;
    •    increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud
         storage systems;
    •    enhancing our network to accommodate business services;
    •    using wireless technologies to extend our services outside of the home;
    •    offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets;
    •    expanding the availability of Horizon TV and Virgin TV Go, as well as Horizon 4, and related products and developing
         and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and
    •    testing new technologies.

     As stated under General Development of Business—Expansion and Acquisitions above, we are expanding our hybrid fiber
coaxial cable network through our Network Extensions. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have
established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to
offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers.

     We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our markets. The cable networks of our
operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits
us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network.

     In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. Almost all of our broadband
networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide
these speeds to our subscribers, we are launching our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout
our footprint. The use of DOCSIS 3.1 technology will provide us significantly higher efficiencies on our networks and allow us
to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the
coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a
cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities
and rural areas of our footprint.




                                                               I-18
  Supply Sources

    Content. With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the deciding factors for
customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view
programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on:

    •    proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations);
    •    product (delivering the best content available);
    •    procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and
    •    partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).

     We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders,
including broadcasters and cable programming networks. Under our distribution agreements, we generally pay a monthly fee on
a per channel or per subscriber basis, with occasional minimum pay guarantees. For on-demand programming, we generally pay
a revenue share for transactional VoD and a flat fee for subscription VoD. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses
with volume discounts and marketing support. For a majority of our agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed
programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets.

     In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney, Time
Warner (including HBO), Fox, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private
broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programing through select relationships with companies such as Sky
plc (Sky) (U.K. and Ireland) and BT Group plc (BT). For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box
sets of television series, movies, music, kids and documentaries. In addition, we currently have an arrangement with Netflix Inc.
(Netflix) to provide access to Netflix for our customers with premium over-the-top (OTT) services. Through this arrangement,
the Netflix content is available via set-top boxes to our video customers across many of our markets. The Netflix app is available
to our customers in the U.K., Ireland and Switzerland. It is also available to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers.

     Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We
have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, STX, Virgin Media
TV (formerly TV3 Group) and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. We
have our own exclusive sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium, and MySports in Switzerland, which UPC Switzerland licenses
to other non-competing cable operations in Switzerland. Also, the VodafoneZiggo JV owns Ziggo Sport. The basic Ziggo Sport
service is available exclusively to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers; however, the premium service is widely available through
license arrangements.

    In addition, we are commissioning our own exclusive drama series content. Through All3Media Ltd., which we own jointly
with Discovery Communications Inc., we are co-producing television series for several of our markets. The first of these series,
The Feed, is expected to be released in 2019. In addition, we have produced the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im
Heimatland and the original Belgium series Chaussée d'Amour with local production companies. With LionsGate Entertainment,
we are a partner in the production of a new spy thriller series The Rook. For each of these programs, the content will be available
on demand to our customers.

    Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers
with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes,
modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer
support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer.
Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services.

     Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds,
from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a fee for software licenses
and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where
TiVo is the provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provides converged television and
broadband internet capabilities. In 2017, we entered into a multi-year extension of our agreements with Tivo. For our mobile
network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and
caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to
pay based on usage of the services.


                                                               I-19
    For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers.
Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers.
We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could
significantly impact our mobile services.

Competition

     All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. Technological advances and product
innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase, giving customers several options for the provision of their
telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless
connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component
of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well as
companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant
competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunication services by focusing on customer service, competitive
pricing and offering quality high-speed internet. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the video,
broadband internet, and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide information on key competitors
in our more material markets.

     We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow
us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed
internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet,
television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available,
our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile
and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects
of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand
is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand.

    Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services
from one provider. In our largest video markets, our key competitors for the provision of converged services are: BT (U.K.),
Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Also, as described above under Products and Services—
Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV, the key competitor for the VodafoneZiggo JV is KPN. Each of these competitors have extensive
resources allowing them to offer competitively priced bundled services. As a result, our ability to offer triple-play or quad-play
bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. We seek to distinguish
ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive services (such as Replay TV and VoD), proprietary sports offerings,
expanded content offers (for both in and out of the home) and our download speeds.

    Portions of our European systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operations. These systems are a
significant competitive factor, primarily for our Poland and Slovakia operations. Based on research of various telecommunication
publications, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and internal estimates, parts of
our operations in Poland and Slovakia are overbuilt by FTTx networks. Other fiber and cable operators are estimated to have
overbuilt approximately 80% of our footprint in Slovakia and 70% of our footprint in Poland. Although we have extensive FTTx
overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition, government and quasi-
government entities in certain of the countries in which we operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx networks, creating another
source of competition.

     In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators
are adopting VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives. For
example, Swisscom has implemented vectoring in Switzerland. Vectoring is a transmission method that coordinates line signals
to reduce crosstalk levels and improve performance. Bonding is a method of taking channels on either DSL or cable plant and
bonding those channels together for a higher bandwidth throughput.

  Video Distribution

     Our video services compete primarily with traditional free-to-air (FTA) broadcast television services, DTH satellite service
providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including incumbent telephony operations
offering (1) DTH satellite services, (2) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an
enhancement to VDSL called "vectoring", (3) IPTV over FTTx networks or (4) LTE Services. Many of these competitors have
a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In
certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems. Mobile broadband has
gained a noticeable share of video subscribers, which is another competitive factor.
                                                               I-20
    OTT video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant
competitive factor, as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO
Now, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and programming from
broadcasters. Generally, the content libraries of such services are offered for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available
on multiple devices in and out of the home. In some cases, OTT services are provided free-of-charge. To enhance our competitive
position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through our online mobile
apps, VoD and Replay TV services or our arrangement with Netflix. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other
sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts
and sporting events.

     Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and
services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors have
obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain programming, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such
programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access
to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland. If
exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on
selecting a video service.

     Similar to our technological advances to enhance our video services, our competitors are also improving their video platforms
with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. Similarly, VDSL, which is either
provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third-party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of
our markets, as are FTTx networks. In all of our markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent
telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include IPTV over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases,
DTH and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony
services and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including
the pricing and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service
providers in a number of our larger markets are pricing their DTT, IPTV or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price
of the comparable digital cable service.

     In our Poland and Slovakia broadband markets, we face intense competition from DTH services. These DTH companies offer
aggressively-priced packages of video content and in some cases offer triple-play packages. FTA broadcasters are also significant
competitors in these markets. Our cable operations stay competitive by offering enhanced digital services, such as HD channel
offerings, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. These operations have also increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-
play bundles to up to 500 Mbps. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options.

    We compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television, Replay
TV, online mobile apps and multiscreen services and multimedia gateways. We also compete by offering advanced digital features
and attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries in which we operate,
we also tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty
contracts. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming.
Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations,
we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged
across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our Horizon TV product to meet our customers’ desire to view
programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets.

    •    Virgin Media. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with FTA television and with Sky, the primary
         pay satellite television provider. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play and quad-play services in the U.K. and Ireland.
         Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk) in the U.K. and Eircom Limited in
         Ireland, each of which offer triple-play services, as well as IPTV video services. Each of these competitors have multimedia
         home gateways.

         Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a
         principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels,
         including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and
         online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms.
         Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor
         and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content,
         including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and
         the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks.
                                                              I-21
         In this competitive market, Virgin Media is expanding its broadband network and promotes its 4K enabled Virgin Media
         V6 set-top box in the U.K. In Ireland it offers Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as “Virgin TV”). The on-line
         streaming service Virgin TV Go is available throughout the Virgin Media footprint. Virgin Media customers also have
         access to third-party apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube and Starz). In addition, Virgin Media’s ability to include mobile for its
         U.K. and Ireland customers for a low incremental fee creating a fixed-mobile convergence bundle is a key market offer.

    •    Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive
         digital television, replay television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service.
         Proximus offers customers a wide range of both individual and bundled services at competitive prices. Also, Telenet and
         other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks. Orange Belgium N.V.
         (Orange Belgium) gained such access in 2016 and currently offers its mobile subscribers a dual play bundle, including
         enhanced video and broadband internet services. Telenet may face increased competition from other providers of video
         services who take advantage of the wholesale access and may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more
         information on wholesale access, see Regulatory Matters—Belgium.

         In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad
         acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR
         functionality, VoD offerings, its Play Sports channel and original programming (e.g. Chaussée d'Amour and De Dag).
         Telenet is able to offer international, national, regional and local content, including Dutch-language broadcasts, to its
         subscribers. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its converged offerings. In addition, Telenet
         continues to enhance its Yelo Play app and programming, including extending its rights to the English Premier League
         through 2019 and the addition of other sports rights.

    •    UPC Switzerland. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which
         provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay
         functionality and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive
         rights to distribute certain sports programming. Sunrise is also a significant competitor with its fixed-mobile converged
         bundles. In this saturated market, price competition is a significant factor. To compete effectively in Switzerland, UPC
         Switzerland is promoting Horizon 4 (marketed as “UPC TV”), as well as Horizon TV, and related family of products
         together with Replay TV and VoD, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing
         preferences. UPC Switzerland also has its own exclusive sports channel, My Sports, and aggregates third-party apps (e.g.
         Netflix and YouTube). It also uses its high-speed internet of up to 50, 200 or 500 Mbps to promote its extended digital
         tier bundles and offer mobile services.

  Internet

     With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving
marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many
of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet
services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product
offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and
businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced
technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks.
In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive
environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers.

     Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying
tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and
packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download internet speeds range from up to 350 Mbps
in the U.K. to speeds of up to 500 Mbps available in Switzerland, Slovakia and Poland. In addition, we offer speeds of up to 1
Gbps in parts of Poland. We use our ultra high-speed internet services with access to Community WiFi and competitively priced
bundles to encourage customers from other providers to switch to our services. The focus is on high-end internet products to
safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market.
By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with local FTTx
initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level. With the
commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan to further
improve our high-speed internet offers.

   Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various
DSL-based technologies by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-
                                                                 I-22
line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE,
are also significant competitors using high-speed mobile networks. We are expanding our ultra high-speed services and increasing
our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that
include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Mobile data is also increasingly important and we are addressing this
through our wide range of mobile products, including expanding our LTE service area and offering SIM-only mobile products,
as well as expanding our Community WiFi network.

    •    Virgin Media. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services,
         including fixed-line incumbent telecommunications providers. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest,
         which provides broadband internet access services to both its own retail customers and third-party retail providers over
         its own DSL network. BT has announced its intention to rollout ultrafast speeds of up to at least 300 Mbps by the end of
         2020 to up to 5.7 million premises using G.fast technology, a DSL standard applied over copper local loops. BT has also
         set out its intention to rollout a FTTx service supporting 1 Gbps to three million homes and businesses by 2020 with a
         target to cover 10 million homes by 2025. As a result of these objectives, BT has launched a range of ultrafast packages
         offering speeds of up to 150 Mbps and 300 Mbps, respectively, using a combination of G.fast and FTTx technology,
         which are currently available to two million U.K. homes.

         Operators such as Sky and TalkTalk deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known
         as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing
         the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital
         investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition
         and pricing pressure in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such
         as LTE mobile services and WiFi services, is significant. Mobile providers continue to gain market share from fixed-line
         providers. These providers offer a range of mobile services.

    •    Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services.
         Telenet’s primary competitor is the DSL service provider Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering
         quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and VDSL services provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Mobile broadband
         penetration continues to increase, reaching nearly 80% of the total population by year-end 2017 based on the BIPT 2017
         Annual Report. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other
         providers who have wholesale access to Telenet’s cable network. Through such access, Orange Belgium currently offers
         its mobile subscribers a dual-play bundle including enhanced video and broadband internet services. In this competitive
         market, Telenet is using its fixed-mobile converged offers to promote its internet and other services.

    •    UPC Switzerland. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is UPC
         Switzerland’s primary competitor. Swisscom internet customers have access to its basic video content free of charge
         through its internet portal. It is also expanding its FTTx network and rolling out G.fast technology. Swisscom offers
         download speeds ranging from 40 Mbps to up to 1 Gbps. Swisscom’s internet speeds include 40 Mbps to 100 Mbps on
         its VDSL network and up to 1 Gbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network
         to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its FTTx network in
         several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been
         reached, Swisscom is building its own FTTx network. With respect to subscribers on the partner networks, UPC
         Switzerland competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these subscribers. In this competitive market,
         UPC Switzerland increased it introductory speed to 50 Mbps and is promoting its broadband services through its bundled
         offers.

  Mobile and Telephony Services

     Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In Belgium, as a mobile network operator, we are one of the larger
mobile providers based on number of SIM cards. We also have a growing mobile business in Switzerland and in the U.K. through
MVNO arrangements. In our other European markets, however, we currently have minimal mobile presence. In the markets where
we are a large mobile provider, we continue to seek additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers
and increase our LTE services. Where we are a small mobile provider, we face significant competition from other mobile telephony
providers, many of whom offer LTE services and are making significant advances in obtaining customers. In all of our markets
competition is intense. We offer various calling plans, such as unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-
peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our
video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is
a key driver. In several of our markets we provide converged services, including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are
also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in our other markets and mobility applications to our other services.

                                                                I-23
     The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by
the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. Our fixed-
line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in the applicable market. In these markets,
the operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote
to the provision of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In all of our markets, we also compete
with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. OTT telephony is also a competitive factor. In addition, our
businesses face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers.

     Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends,
the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth
of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and general price competition. Carrier pre-select services
allow the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. Our
fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination”.
Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In
many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls from
their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer needs and, similar to our
mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony
services and flat rate offers are standard.

     The incumbent telecommunication companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators and other VoIP operators,
including ISPs, offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets. Due to the maturity of
the telephony market, competition is particularly intense in all of our markets with price often the deciding factor. To maintain or
increase market share, we and our competitors focus on bundling telephony services with quality broadband offerings and other
services. In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have
competitive mobile offers based on LTE services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are BT (UK),
Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these
markets based on number of SIM cards. These competitors include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services.
Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive.

  Discontinued Operations

    The primary competitor of Unitymedia is from FTA television received via satellite. Its primary competition for pay TV
services is Deutsche Telekom, the incumbent telecommunications operator. Deutsche Telekom is also a significant competitor for
broadband and wireless services. Deutsche Telekom offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence. In
addition, Vodafone, also a competitor in Germany, bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche
Telekom’s DSL network under a resell agreement making it a significant competitor in the double-play and triple-play market in
Unitymedia’s footprint. It also has expanded its bundle offers to include mobile products. These converged offerings may enable
Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to reduce churn and attract new customers.

     The other markets (Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic) face competition from DTH services. FTA broadcasters are
also significant competitors. Significant portions of these markets have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operators,
creating an additional competitive factor. In all the Vodafone Disposal Group markets, competition is intense.

Regulatory Matters

  Overview

    Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in
which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in
European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union (E.U.).

     Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed
on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and
the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In
addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions,
interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties.
Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.




                                                               I-24
     Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the E.U. as of December 31, 2018. As such, these countries are required to
harmonize certain laws with E.U. rules by transposing directives into their national law. In addition, other types of E.U. rules (or
regulations) are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. Certain E.U. rules are
also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the E.U. Member States (excluding Croatia) as
well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway as of December 31, 2018.

     On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which U.K. citizens voted in favor of, on an advisory basis, an exit from
the E.U. commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The terms of Brexit are subject to a negotiation period that could take until March
2019. The potential impacts, if any, of the uncertainty relating to Brexit or the resulting terms of Brexit on the free movement of
goods, services, people, data and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates,
currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters are unclear. In addition, the value of the British pound sterling
relative to the U.S. dollar remains at levels that are significantly below pre-Brexit levels. The effects of Brexit could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. One such area is the E.U. Communication Regulation described
below. If a Brexit deal is agreed, the U.K. government has confirmed that it will transpose such regulation. If, however, no Brexit
deal is approved, the U.K. Government has indicated that it will implement only the parts that support its policy objectives.

    In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive E.U.-level legislative action. As a result, most of
the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been
developed by the E.U. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the E.U. and is not part of the European Economic
Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulations in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may
have a material impact on our business.

    On May 6, 2015, the European Commission published its Digital Single Market strategy document. The strategy is an
aggregation of many different policy areas with the purpose of creating a digital single market to expand jobs and stimulate growth.
The strategy includes policy review in the areas of E.U. communications regulation, broadcasting law, copyright reform and anti-
competitive geo-blocking practices.

  E.U. Communications Regulation

     The E.U. law that is the primary source of communications regulation in the European Union is the European Electronic
Communications Code (the Code). The Code came into effect on December 20, 2018, as part of the Digital Single Market strategy
and will need to be transposed into national law by December 21, 2020. Until then, its predecessor, the “Regulatory Framework”,
will continue to apply. Although many of the rules under the Regulatory Framework have been included in the Code, there are
significant changes required to be implemented by Member States.

     The Code, similar to the Regulatory Framework, primarily seeks to develop open markets for communication services within
Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including
cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony (including
OTT services), internet and, to some degree, television services. The Code also includes a number of provisions aimed at providing
incentives to boost private sector investment in very high capacity networks, and stimulating the harmonization of spectrum
licensing to encourage investment in mobile networks and will result in more advanced services. The Code does not generally
address content matters, including radio and television programming, which are specifically regulated by the Audiovisual Media
Services Directive (as defined and described below).

    Set forth below are certain key provisions included in the Code. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive or
exhaustive description of all regulation in this area.

    •    Licensing and Exclusivity. The Code, similar to the Regulatory Framework, requires Member States to abolish
         exclusivities on communication networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on
         a simple registration. The Code sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks
         and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of
         regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations,
         provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations.

    •    Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Code, similar to the Regulatory Framework, apply
         only to operators or service providers with Significant Market Power (defined below) in a relevant market. For example,
         the provisions of the Code allow the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) in E.U. Member States to mandate certain
         access obligations only for those operators and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For

                                                                I-25
         purposes of the Code, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have “Significant Market Power” where, either
         individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength affording it the power to behave
         to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers.

         As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Code, each Member State’s NRA is required to analyze certain
         markets predefined by the European Commission to determine if any operator or service provider has Significant Market
         Power. The European Commission has currently recommended that there be four such predefined markets, which are
         subject to periodic review. NRAs may, however, perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation, which
         requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met.

         NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power, single or jointly with another provider, in any of these
         predefined markets or they may define and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant
         Market Power in any particular market, an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Code, the European
         Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which
         power also applies with respect to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by
         the European Commission or an additional market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market
         Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible.

    •    Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by
         the Code. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable must carry
         obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are required to be
         based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and be transparent and subject to periodic review.
         We are subject to must carry regulations in all markets in which we operate. Must carry regulations are significantly
         different among Member States. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable under the Code.
         To date, however, the European Commission has taken very limited steps to enforce E.U. law in this area, leaving must
         carry obligations intact in certain Member States. We do not expect the European Commission or the Member States to
         curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.

    •    Net Neutrality/Traffic Management/Roaming. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the
         first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, permits the
         provision of specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects operators to reasonable traffic management
         requirements. The regulation also abolished roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017.

  Broadcasting Law

     Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Code, the activities of a broadcaster
are harmonized by other elements of E.U. law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS). The AVMS was
revised and reissued December 18, 2018 under the Digital Single Market strategy. E.U. Member States must implement the revised
AVMS into law by September 19, 2020. The revised AVMS maintained the country of origin principle and European works quota.

     Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that
Member State. Pursuant to the AVMS, however, E.U. Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters
established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with
the law of their home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under the AVMS, the country of origin principle
applies also to non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we could offer our own VoD services across the European Economic
Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could have a single regulatory regime for all of our VoD
services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it is the business of the third-party
provider of the services, and not us as the distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services.

     The AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European
producers who are independent of broadcasters. The revised AVMS extended these quotas to linear and non-linear services. Under
the AVMS, the providers of these services, including our operations, may be required to contribute financially to the European
producers of the programming.

     According to the regulation of the European Commission addressing the portability of online audiovisual content services
adopted in June 2017 and effective in April 2018, commercial providers of online content services (including OTT service providers)
are required to enable subscribers who are temporarily present in any Member State with access and use of online content services
in substantially the same manner as in the Member State of residence. We have modified our services to comply with these
portability requirements.


                                                                I-26
  Copyright Law

      In September 2016, the European Commission proposed a new regulation relating to satellite and cable retransmissions;
 again, as part of its Digital Single Market strategy. The proposal introduces a new country of origin principle in relation to online
 content, extends the existing copyright clearance system to other technologies (such as satellite, mobile and IPTV) and extends
 a similar rights clearance system to directly injected cable channels. Adoption of the proposal is expected in mid-2019. Once
 adopted, Member States will be required to transpose this retransmission proposal into national law within 24 months.

  Other European Level Regulation

     In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with both specific and
general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention and electronic commerce. On May 25, 2018, the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to data protection and retention became effective in the E.U.. The GDPR sets strict
standards regarding the handling, use and retention of personal data. Organizations that fail to comply will face stiff penalties. As
required, our operations have implemented various measures internally and with third-party vendors to meet these requirements.
In addition, the European Commission published in January 2017, a proposal for a new e-Privacy regulation, replacing the current
e-Privacy Directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. Negotiations among E.U. Member
States are still in process on this proposal.

     Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer
protection, which are broadly harmonized at the E.U. level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services
in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable
television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to
which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages.

     The European Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy
consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and
studies regarding energy consumption with the European Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we
are working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through
software to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of
companies to create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation, which has been
formally recognized by the European Commission. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely
affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers.

    Pursuant to an E.U. Regulation on standby power (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low
power standby mode or off mode, unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. Furthermore, the Networked
Standby amendment to the Standby Regulation, effective as of January 1, 2015, regulates, among others, the maximum power
consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called “Networked Standby” mode. As a result, all of the devices
we purchase and/or develop, including Horizon TV and Horizon 4 set-top boxes, Connect Boxes, cable modems and certain other
equipment, operate under the power management requirements of the Standby Regulation.

     As part of the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television
was approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700
- 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum becomes available varies among the European countries in which we
operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to:
(1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks,
or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy Program states
that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful interference. As a
result, we are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the European Commission to be included in LTE mobile
trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialog with equipment manufacturers
and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks.

     Also, the Radio Equipment Directive, applicable since June 2016 and transposed into national legislation by E.U. Member
States, establishes a regulatory framework for placing radio equipment on the market. Its objective is a single market for radio
equipment by setting essential requirements for safety and health, electromagnetic compatibility, and the efficient use of the radio
spectrum. It also provides the basis for further regulation governing some additional aspects. These include technical features for
the protection of privacy, personal data and fraud. Furthermore, additional aspects cover interoperability, access to emergency
services, and compliance regarding the combination of radio equipment and software. It also takes into account of the need for
improved market surveillance; in particular, for the traceability obligations of manufacturers, importers and distributors. As a


                                                                 I-27
result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop, including Horizon TV and Horizon 4 set-top boxes, Connect Boxes, cable
modems, which contain radio interfaces (such as WiFi) and certain other equipment, must operate under these rules.

     There is a Mutual Recognition Agreement established between the E.U. and Switzerland for the purpose of mutual recognition
of conformity assessment of regulated products. As a result, the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive are also
applicable in Switzerland.

    With respect to cybersecurity, the E.U. adopted a directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive),
which provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the E.U. Under the NIS Directive, E.U. Member States
had until May 2018 to transpose it into their national laws and identify operators of essential services by November 2018. In
principle, our operations within the E.U. do not fall under the NIS Directive as it exempts providers of Electronic Communications
Services, which are governed by the E.U. telecommunications framework. Some national transpositions (for example, the
Netherlands) and national definitions of essential services, however, could fall under specific NIS Directive obligations. As a
result, our network and communication equipment would need to be compliant with these obligations. To date, none of our operating
companies have been identified as falling under these obligations or being categorized as essential services. In the Netherlands,
however, the VodafoneZiggo JV has been identified as an operator of essential telecommunication facilities due to its customer
base of over one million subscribers. See —Netherlands below.

  United Kingdom

     In the U.K., the Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms
of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006,
which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges,
license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations
2003, as amended, implemented E.U. Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of
privacy in the electronic communications sector.

    Telecommunications companies in the U.K., including Virgin Media, are also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting
Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998, the Enterprise Act
2002 and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013. The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) regulates both linear
and on-demand programming, with regulatory requirements derived from the AVMS.

     Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates in the U.K. It is responsible
for furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant
markets where appropriate by promoting competition. From April 1, 2017, Ofcom also assumed the responsibilities of regulating
the BBC, a role previously undertaken by the BBC Trust. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction with
respect to competition matters.

    Broadband Expansion. At the end of 2018, super-fast broadband was available to more than 95% of U.K. premises. The U.K.
government plans to extend availability as far as possible beyond 95%. To stimulate private investment in this endeavor, the U.K.
government is using money from the publicly funded BBC license fee, underspend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and
other sources of public investment. The state aid measure permitting this subsidy was renewed (and amended) in 2016 and is
expected, through amendments to its “underspend” provisions, to result in up to an additional 1% to 2% super-fast coverage.

     The U.K. government also supports the market rollout of full fiber and 5G services. Such support includes public funding for
the creation of a match-funded “full fiber deployment” fund, business rate relief for the deployment of new full fiber networks
and public funding for a strategic program of full fiber and 5G trials. The U.K. government has set aside £740.0 million ($943.2
million) for that purpose, of which approximately £415.0 million ($528.9 million) is split among a local full fiber deployment
fund, the first phase of the 5G trials and a gigabit voucher scheme. An additional £400.0 million ($509.8 million) has been made
available as a contribution to a Digital Infrastructure Investment Fund, which is an arms-length lending facility of the U.K.
government.

     The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill received Royal Assent in February 2018, which gives effect to the U.K.
government’s plans to provide full business rate relief for new fiber infrastructure built during the 2017-2022 rating period.
Secondary legislation followed in April 2018, clarifying that the relief also applies to new lite fiber and any plant and machinery
used to build the infrastructure. In addition, the U.K. government published its Telecoms Infrastructure Review in July 2018. This
Review explored whether the conditions for investment in fiber are optimal in the U.K. and what policy changes should be
considered to encourage greater investment in new digital infrastructure. The Government concluded that, with the right policy
support, infrastructure based competition will deliver FTTP/Gbit capable networks to approximately 90% of U.K. premises. To
facilitate this, the U.K. government intends to introduce a notification regime for multiple dwelling unit wayleaves, introduce a

                                                                I-28
requirement for new housing developments to have FTTP access and increase consistency in street works and duct access.
Consultations on multiple dwelling unit wayleaves and new development FTTP requirements were issued in December 2018. The
U.K. government is expected to publish its conclusions for these actions in the spring of 2019.

     In November 2015, the U.K. government announced that everyone will, by 2020, have a legal right to request a broadband
connection of at least 10 Mbps regardless of where they live. The government intends to achieve this by introducing a broadband
Universal Service Obligation (USO). The USO is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population in the U.K.
without access to a broadband connection of a reasonable speed. The U.K. government introduced legislation in July 2017, to
facilitate the introduction of a broadband USO. At the same time, BT made an alternative offer to invest approximately £600.0
million ($764.7 million) to provide ubiquitous minimum broadband speeds of 10 Mbps by 2022. The U.K. government formally
rejected BT’s proposal in December 2017, favoring the imposition of a regulated USO. The U.K. government set out the design
for the USO in secondary legislation in March 2018. Ofcom has responsibility for implementation (including designation of the
Universal Service Providers (USPs) and deciding whether a USO constitutes an “unfair burden” on the USPs and, if so, designing
an industry funding mechanism). It has until March 28, 2020 to make such determination. In December 2018, Ofcom issued a
consultation on its proposed designation of BT and KCOM Group PLC as the USPs. Ofcom will consult on its approach to assessing
any unfair burden claims as well as determining which operators would be required to contribute to a universal service industry
fund in the Summer of 2019.

     Television and VoD Services. In the U.K., Virgin Media is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts
1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels and any electronic programme guides), which Virgin Media
owns or operates and for the provision of certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides.
These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each
covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions issued by
Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the license holder and, ultimately,
the license being revoked.

     As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), Virgin Media must comply with a number of statutory obligations
in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with
the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the prohibition on providing an ODPS.

    Regulation of Broadband Markets. In March 2018, Ofcom completed its latest review of the Wholesale Local Access market
(incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and duct access). Ofcom found that BT continues to
hold Significant Market Power and had corresponding remedies imposed on it until April 2021. These remedies include price
controls on “virtual” access to its wholesale 40/10Mbps FTTx product, the maintenance of access and pricing controls on its
wholesale copper products and improvements to the existing physical infrastructure access product (third party access to BT’s
duct and pole estate).

      Future Approach to Regulation. In July 2018, Ofcom published a Strategic Policy Position, setting out its intended future
 approach to regulation from April 2021 (aimed at creating regulatory certainty to support investment in full fiber broadband).
 This resulted from its strategic review of digital communications in 2015 and 2016. It includes an intention to take a more
 holistic consideration of business and residential markets (ultimately combining previously separate markets) and to consider
 different regulatory approaches in different parts of the country, reflecting the varying levels of network competition. In December
 2018, Ofcom published a consultation on its future approach for assessing geographic markets (to apply to the business and
 broadband market reviews from April 2021). It proposes to categorize areas of the country as follows: competitive areas,
 potentially competitive areas and non-competitive areas. In competitive areas, Ofcom will de-regulate; in potentially competitive
 areas, Ofcom will apply an investment friendly approach to regulation; and in non-competitive areas, Ofcom will regulate to
 protect consumers, while encouraging investment by Openreach, a division of BT. Ofcom has indicated that, at present, no areas
 of the U.K. are competitive, approximately 70% of U.K. premises are in potentially competitive areas and approximately 30%
 of U.K. premises are in non-competitive areas. Ofcom will consult on the suite of potential regulatory remedies that it will apply
 to the new holistic approach to market assessment in the spring of 2019.

     Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom concluded its latest review of the U.K. business connectivity markets
(leased lines and dedicated business connections, among others) in the spring of 2016. Ofcom found BT held Significant Market
Power in certain markets and proposed consequential regulatory remedies. These remedies included an obligation on BT to provide
access to its dark fiber. This requirement was overturned on appeal. Ofcom commenced its latest review of these markets in
November 2018. It has provisionally found that BT holds Significant Market Power in certain markets and geographies and has
proposed remedies, including price caps and a narrower dark fibre obligation in areas where there is no infrastructure competition.
Ofcom is also proposing to remove restrictions on BT with respect to duct and pole access so that such access can be used for
business circuits exclusively without needing to be part of a wider (residential grade) broadband deployment.

                                                                I-29
     Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to E.U. regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These
regulations: set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming
within the E.U.; provide for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information; impose measures to guard against bill
shock in respect of data roaming; and set maximum roaming rates within the E.U. Effective June 2017, the E.U. abolished roaming
tariffs.

    Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power
charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to
Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2018-2021, with rates reducing by approximately 5%
from their starting levels by the end of this period.

    Fixed Voice Termination. Virgin Media has been designated as a provider with Significant Market Power on fixed voice
termination. As a result, the rates it charges other providers for termination on its network are subject to regulation. This requires,
among other things, the provision of termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges, which must be no higher
than BT’s regulated charges, unless certain conditions are met.

  Belgium

    Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of
June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform a market
analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament
prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012.

     Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power in the market for call termination on an individual fixed
public telephone network. Since April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging
the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. Following a court annulment of a final decision
on wholesale tariffs issued by BIPT in 2016, BIPT issued a new decision in November 2018 that proposes a wholesale tariff of
€0.11 cents per minute as of January 1, 2019.

    In May 2017, BIPT published its latest decision on the relevant market for “call termination on individual mobile networks”.
Telenet, as an mobile network operator, has also been designated in the draft decision as having Significant Market Power by
BIPT. In the draft decision, BIPT adopts a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on
individual mobile networks, resulting in a nominal value of €0.99 ($1.13) per minute as of July 1, 2017.

     In 2011, BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) found Telenet
to have Significant Market Power in the broadcasting market (the 2011 Decision). The 2011 Decision imposed on Telenet an
obligation to provide third-party operators, at specified “retail minus” tariff rates, with (1) a resale offer of an analog television
package, (2) access to digital television platforms and (3) a resale offer of broadband internet access in combination with the digital
television access obligation.

     On July 7, 2017, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft market review decision (the 2017 Draft Decision),
which was filed with the European Commission on April 27, 2018. The European Commission issued comments in May 2018
and the 2017 Draft Decision was adopted on June 29, 2018 (the 2018 Decision). The 2018 Decision replaces the 2011 Decision.
The 2018 Decision confirms that Telenet has Significant Market Power in the wholesale broadband market. The obligations include
(1) providing third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video)
and (2) making available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access (including fixed voice as an option).
The 2018 Decision no longer applies a retail minus pricing on Telenet. Instead, it imposes monthly wholesale cable resale access
prices during an interim period before setting “reasonable access tariffs”. These tariffs are expected to be implemented in mid-2019
with a link to cable cost model that is under development by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities of €20.29 ($23.24) (for services
including broadband speeds of up to 149 Mbps) and of €30.12 ($34.49) (for services including broadband speeds of at least 150
Mbps). Telenet considers the 2018 Decision to be inconsistent with the principle of technology-neutral regulation and the European
Single Market Strategy to stimulate further investments in broadband networks. As a result, Telenet has filed an appeal on the
matter with the European Court of First Instance and the Brussels Markets Court, respectively.

     The 2018 Decision aims to, and in its application, may strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to
Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in
developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to
Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s
ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent


                                                                 I-30
on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access afforded to Telenet’s network, the rates that Telenet receives for
such access and other competitive factors or market developments.

  Switzerland

     Switzerland has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U., but otherwise is distinct from the European
regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission
of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television,
however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen). In addition, the Competition
Act, the Data Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are potentially relevant to our
business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the Energy Ordinance are applicable
to set-top boxes.

     Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunication services needs to register with the Federal Office of
Communications. Dominant providers must grant access to their network to third parties, including LLU access; however, it is
restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to our
business in Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient
capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard.
Dominant operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming part of the universal service in
Switzerland have to ensure interoperability of services.

    In regards to call termination as part of interconnection agreements, Swisscom as market dominant provider, must offer these
services at cost-oriented prices and disclose the conditions and prices for their individual access services. In interconnection
agreements with Swisscom, reciprocal termination rates are imposed.

     In September 2017, a draft of the revised Telecommunications Act was published by the Federal Council. The Federal Council
plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better consumer and youth protection measures
(such as decreasing roaming fees, measures to prevent spoofing) and a change to the regulatory regime giving the Federal
Communications Commission partial ex officio rights to impose obligations on market dominant providers. In terms of net
neutrality, the draft foresees more transparency for the customer—he/she must be informed of traffic if treated unequally. During
parliamentary debates on the proposal in 2018, new articles to the proposal were introduced. As a result, the proposal is subject
to further parliamentary action to resolve differences and is not expected to be legally binding prior to 2020.

    Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain
programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of
Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation.

    In September 2016, the Intelligence Agencies Act was approved by the Swiss population and became effective in September
2017. For Telecommunications service providers, the Intelligence Agencies Act set forth new obligations regulating cable traffic.

    The revised version of the Data Protection Act foresees more transparency regarding the processing of data. One example is
by reinforcing the information duties when processing personal data. Furthermore, the new version follows the developments in
the E.U. This revised version was subject to public consultation until April 2017. The Federal Council published the draft in
September 2017. Subsequently, parliament decided that the revision would be implemented in two phases. For phase one, only
mandatory alignments with E.U. rules will be implemented. For phase two, which includes more extensive provisions, further
discussion by parliament will be undertaken in 2019.

  The Netherlands

     The Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. Pursuant to the electronic
communications law, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, performed a market analysis to determine
which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed its analysis of the
television market and concluded that there were no grounds for regulation of that market. As a result, no new regulations relating
to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis. Similar to our other operations, the VodafoneZiggo JV is subject
to must carry obligations, including a number of regional and local broadcasting channels, as well as public broadcasting channels.

    On August 5, 2013, ACM published a market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed termination
market and the mobile termination market. Following various administrative actions, which resulted in the Dutch Supreme
Administrative Court upholding the ACM decision in July 2017. The implementation of the new tariff under the ACM market
analysis decision on call termination became effective on July 12, 2017, and will apply until July 12, 2020. The VodafoneZiggo
                                                              I-31
JV appealed ACM’s market decision. In September 2018, the appeal court delivered a verdict against ACM’s market decision.
The verdict provides guidance sought by the VodafoneZiggo JV on the interpretation and setting of interconnection tariffs among
operators.

     In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator KPN filed an appeal against the European Commission
regarding its decision to approve the acquisition of Ziggo, which we completed in November 2014. In October 2017, the European
General Court ruled that the European Commission did not state sufficient reasons for not analyzing the possible vertical anti-
competitive effects on the market for premium pay TV sports channels; thereby annulling the European Commission’s clearance
of the Ziggo acquisition. The E.U. Merger Regulation provides in such a case that the transaction be re-examined by the European
Commission with a view of adopting a new decision. As a result, we filed a formal re-notification of the Ziggo acquisition with
the European Commission. In May 2018, the European Commission again cleared the acquisition. KPN filed a pro forma appeal
on this decision. We have not received any further information on this proceeding from the European General Court.

     KPN also filed a court challenge against the European Commission’s 2016 decision that approved the VodafoneZiggo JV
transaction. KPN is seeking annulment of the 2016 decision. Oral hearings took place in November 2018. A decision on this action
is not expected before the third quarter of 2019.

     On February 27, 2018, the ACM published a draft decision of its analysis of the LLU market, concluding that there is a single
market for local and central access. ACM referred to this market as the Wholesale Fixed Access market and concluded that KPN
and the VodafoneZiggo JV had joint Significant Market Power. As a result, ACM imposed on the VodafoneZiggo JV an obligation
to offer wholesale cable access and continued wholesale cable access regulation of KPN. Following a market consultation, ACM
submitted the draft decision to the European Commission. After comments by the European Commission, ACM published the
final decision on September 28, 2018, which became effective on October 1, 2018. The VodafoneZiggo JV published a draft
Reference Offer on December 31, 2018 and will publish a cost model in 2019. The VodafoneZiggo JV only has to invest in the
implementation of cable access if there is actual demand (i.e. a signed contract with an access seeker). The VodafoneZiggo JV has
appealed ACM’s decision before the national court and initiated an action before the European General Court.

     On November 9, 2018, the implementation of the NIS Directive by the Netherlands entered into force. In general, providers
of electronic communication services are not in scope of the NIS Directive. The legislator for the Netherlands, however, decided
to apply, to a certain extent, the NIS Directive on providers of electronic communication services. As a result, the VodafoneZiggo
JV must notify the Netherlands Telecoms Agency and the National Cyber Security Center when a cybersecurity incident occurs,
as well as the Netherlands Data Protection Authority if a data breach occurs.

  Discontinued Operations—Germany

     Germany has incorporated the E.U. laws into national laws, although under the German legal system competency is split
between the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German
Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by
telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The German Federal Network Agency
(Bundesnetzagentur) is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel
Office (the FCO), the national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure
and media regulation. The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition
issues will be addressed by the German Federal Network Agency.

     Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16
federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting
Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own
independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector.
The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation
of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of channel
carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, electronic programming guides, the bundling of programs and price regulation.

    The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the
German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other
content providers through conditional access systems.

     Unitymedia has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual
fixed public telephone network. Since November 2013, reciprocal termination rates for exchanging calls via Unitymedia’s IP-
interface have been imposed, which results in Unitymedia, like every other telecommunications provider in Germany, charging
the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom, when receiving traffic via the IP-

                                                               I-32
interface. The level of termination rates applicable to Unitymedia with respect to calls terminating on its IP-interface was set at
€0.001 ($0.0011) per minute in 2018 and is currently set at €0.0008 ($0.0009) per minute.

Employees

    As of December 31, 2018, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 26,600 full-time
equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works councils, and excludes contractors and temporary
employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating
our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our company.

    The risk factors described in this section have been separated into four groups:

    •    risks that relate to the competition we face and the technology used in our businesses;

    •    risks that relate to our operating in overseas markets and being subject to foreign regulation;

    •    risks that relate to certain financial matters; and

    •    other risks, including risks that, among other things, relate to the obstacles that may be faced by anyone who may seek
         to acquire us.

     Although we describe below and elsewhere in this Annual Report the risks we consider to be the most material, there may be
other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse
effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, past financial performance
may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.

    If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Factors Relating to Competition and Technology

     We operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively compete with other
service providers. The markets for cable television, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services are highly competitive. In
the provision of video services, we face competition from FTA and DTT broadcasters, video provided via satellite platforms,
networks using DSL, VDSL or vectoring technology, multi-channel multipoint distribution system operators, FTTx networks,
OTT video content aggregators, and, in some countries where parts of our systems are overbuilt, cable networks, among others.
Our operating businesses are facing increasing competition from video services provided by, or over the networks of, incumbent
telecommunications operators and other service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet increases, we also
face competition from OTT video content providers utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections. In the
provision of telephony and broadband internet services, we are experiencing increasing competition from the incumbent
telecommunications operators and other service providers in each country in which we operate, as well as mobile providers of
voice and data. The incumbent telecommunications operators typically dominate the market for these services and have the
advantage of nationwide networks and greater resources than we have to devote to the provision of these services. Many of the
incumbent operators offer double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries, we also compete
with other operators using LLU to provide these services, other facilities-based operators and wireless providers. Developments
in the DSL and other technology used by the incumbent telecommunications operators and alternative providers have improved
the attractiveness of our competitors’ products and services and strengthened their competitive position. Developments in wireless
technologies, such as LTE and WiFi, are creating additional competitive challenges.


                                                                 I-33
     In some of our markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved, either directly or indirectly,
in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications systems. We intend to pursue available options to
restrict such involvement or to ensure that such involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in these pursuits. As a result, we may face competition from entities not requiring a normal
commercial return on their investments. In addition, we may face more vigorous competition than would have been the case if
there were no government involvement.

     We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and new market
entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, advances in technology, the
influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased
competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and
significant price and promotional competition in our markets. In combination with difficult economic environments, these
competitive pressures could adversely impact our ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, average revenue
per RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable (ARPU), RGUs, mobile subscribers, adjusted operating income before depreciation
and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA), Adjusted OIBDA margins and liquidity of our operating segments.

     Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Technology in the video,
telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including advances in current technologies and the emergence
of new technologies. New technologies, products and services may impact consumer behavior and therefore demand for our
products and services. The ability to anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and
enhanced products and services on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our revenue and number of
subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations or demand,
can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance of new products and
services that we may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or services by others, could have a material
adverse impact on our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA.

    Our significant property and equipment additions, namely in connection with our Network Extensions, may not generate
a positive return. Significant additions to our property and equipment are, or in the future may be, required to add customers to
our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and upgrade customer premises equipment to
enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience. Additions to our property and equipment, which are currently
underway, including in connection with our Network Extensions, require significant capital expenditures for equipment and
associated labor costs to build out and/or upgrade our networks as well as for related customer premises equipment. Additionally,
significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced
DSL technologies, the impact of natural disasters, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to undertake
previously unplanned builds or upgrades of our networks and customer premises equipment.

     No assurance can be given that any rebuilds, upgrades or extensions of our network (including the Network Extensions) will
increase penetration rates, increase average monthly subscription revenue per average cable RGU or mobile subscriber, as
applicable, or otherwise generate positive returns as anticipated, or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such
rebuilds, upgrades or extensions. Additionally, costs related to our Network Extensions and property and equipment additions
could end up being greater than originally anticipated or planned. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner
than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego
market opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and our ability to incur additional
debt will be limited by our debt agreements. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers,
expanding, extending or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our property and equipment,
or are delayed in making such investments, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed.

      We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters for
programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable terms could adversely
affect our business. The success of our video subscription business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a wide selection
of popular programming to our subscribers. We generally do not produce our own content and we depend on our agreements,
relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If we
fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay television services, including a sufficient selection of HD channels
as well as non-linear content (such as a selection of attractive VoD content and rights for ancillary services such as DVR and catch
up or 'Replay' services), on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling video product to our customers at a price
they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and our annual
costs for programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming
agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming and copyright costs will continue to rise in future periods
as a result of (1) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary

                                                                I-34
product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, (2) rate increases and (3) growth in the number
of our enhanced video subscribers.

    If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and future video services
could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers from
lower-tier programming to higher-tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore, we
may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain of our competitors obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly with
respect to popular sports and movie programming, and as certain entrants in the OTT market, for example Netflix, Amazon and
even Disney, increasingly produce their own exclusive content.

     We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services required
for our businesses. We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide
services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various
risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor
issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis
or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in completing extensions to our
networks and in connecting customers to our services and, accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase
our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial
difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect
our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party
suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an
adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various
technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our
or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into
licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights
in question.

     Certain of our businesses that offer mobile telephony and data services rely on the radio access networks of third-party
wireless network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. Our services to mobile customers in many jurisdictions
in which we operate rely on the use of MVNO arrangements in which we utilize the radio access networks of third-party wireless
network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. If any of our MVNO arrangements are terminated, or if the respective
third-party wireless network provider fails to provide the services required under an MVNO arrangement, or if a third-party wireless
network provider fails to deploy and maintain its network, and we are unable to find a replacement network operator on a timely
and commercially reasonable basis or at all, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services relying on such MVNO
arrangement. Additionally, as our MVNO arrangements come to term, we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement
MVNO arrangements on the same or more favorable terms.

     Failure in our or third-party technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data could
significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our customer base and result in fines, litigation or lost revenue. Our success depends,
in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and network systems, including internet
sites, data hosting and processing facilities and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, as well as our
customer service centers. Some of these are managed, hosted, provided or used by third-party service providers or their vendors,
to assist in conducting our business. In addition, the hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network
in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively small number of locations. Our and our third-party service
providers’ systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable to damage or security breach from a
variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts, security flaws, and natural disasters.
Moreover, despite security measures, our and our third-party service providers’ servers, systems and equipment are potentially
vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. We and
our third party service providers may not be able to anticipate or respond in an adequate and timely manner to attempts to obtain
authorized access to, disable or degrade our or our third party service providers’ systems because the techniques for doing so
change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated and are difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, the security
measures and procedures we and our third-party service providers have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other
information may not be sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. In some cases, mitigation
efforts may depend on third parties who may not deliver products or services that meet the required contractual standards or whose
hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, or outage.

    Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or
accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-
party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance

                                                                 I-35
of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being
considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related
risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply
with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines, litigation or regulatory actions by state, federal
or non-U.S. authorities.

     Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause business disruptions such
as failures in our information technology systems, disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks or similar problems.
Further, although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect
our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will
prevent these threats. Any disruptive situation that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our
reputation and the credibility of our operations, and could subject us to potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions
against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Further,
sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to our customers or otherwise meet our business
obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and an adverse impact on
revenue. Also, a cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems
associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to
protect personal information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in
a disruption of our operations.

     The “Virgin” brand is used by our subsidiary Virgin Media under licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited and is not
under the control of Virgin Media. The activities of the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand and other licensees
could have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of customers towards Virgin Media as a licensee and the licenses from
Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. The “Virgin” brand is integral to Virgin Media’s corporate
identity. Virgin Media is reliant on the general goodwill of consumers towards the Virgin brand. Consequently, adverse publicity
in relation to the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson, who is closely
associated with the brand, or in relation to another licensee of the “Virgin” name and logo (particularly in the U.K., where Virgin
Media does business) could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s reputation and on Virgin Media’s and our business
and results of operations. In addition, the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances.
For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the licenses, after providing Virgin Media with an opportunity to cure, (1)
if Virgin Media or any of its affiliates commits persistent and material breaches or a flagrant and material breach of the licenses,
(2) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the licensed trademarks by
Virgin Media has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the “Virgin” brand, or (3) if a
third-party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a “fit and proper person”, such as a legally disqualified director or a
bankrupt entity, acquires “control” of Liberty Global. Such a termination could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s
and our business and results of operations.

Factors Relating to Overseas Operations and Foreign Regulation

    Our businesses are conducted almost exclusively outside of the U.S., which gives rise to numerous operational risks. Our
businesses operate almost exclusively in countries outside the U.S. and are thereby subject to the following inherent risks:

    •    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

    •    difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    •    potentially adverse tax consequences;

    •    export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers;

    •    increases in taxes and governmental fees;

    •    economic and political instability; and

    •    changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies.

     Operational risks that we may experience in certain countries include disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment
that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political
unrest.


                                                                   I-36
     We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect
to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the
operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although we generally seek to match the
denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the
respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not
denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for
an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert
unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2018, substantially all of our debt was either directly
or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations.

     In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are
exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts,
notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in
our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, we will consider
hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or
receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or
receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge certain of these risks. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note
8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against
the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign
currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency
translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a
negative impact on our comprehensive earnings or loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency
translation. Our primary exposure to foreign currency translation risk during the three months ended December 31, 2018 was to
the British pound sterling and euro as 52.9% and 32.4% of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries
whose functional currencies are the British pound sterling and euro, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are
impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Swiss franc and other local currencies in Europe. We do not hedge against the
risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S.
dollars.

     Our businesses are subject to risks of adverse regulation. Our businesses are subject to the unique regulatory regimes of the
countries in which they operate. Video distribution, broadband internet, telephony and mobile businesses are subject to licensing
or registration eligibility rules and regulations, which vary by country. The provision of electronic communications networks and
services requires our licensing from, or registration with, the appropriate regulatory authorities and, for telephony services, entrance
into interconnection arrangements with other phone companies, including the incumbent phone company. It is possible that countries
in which we operate may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic commerce, which could dampen the growth of the
internet services being offered and developed by these businesses. In a number of countries, our ability to increase the prices we
charge for our cable television service or make changes to the programming packages we offer is limited by regulation or conditions
imposed by competition authorities or is subject to review by regulatory authorities or is subject to termination rights of customers.
In addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third parties and, in any event, in most of our markets new entry is
possible without a license, although there may be registration eligibility rules and regulations, resulting in greater competition in
territories where our businesses may already be active. More significantly, regulatory authorities may require us to grant third
parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to
end customers. Consequently, our businesses must adapt their ownership and organizational structure as well as their pricing and
service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which they are subject. A failure to comply with applicable rules and
regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse conditions.

    Adverse changes in rules and regulations could:

    •    impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue and Adjusted OIBDA;


                                                                 I-37
    •    create a shortage of capacity on our networks, which could limit the types and variety of services we seek to provide our
         customers;

    •    impact our ability to access spectrum for our mobile services;

    •    strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets; and

    •    have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.

     Businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, such as video distribution as well as internet, telephony, and/or mobile
services, or that are vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, often face close regulatory
scrutiny from competition authorities in several countries in which they operate. This is particularly the case with respect to any
proposed business combinations, which will often require clearance from national competition authorities. The regulatory
authorities in several countries in which we do business have considered from time to time what access rights, if any, should be
afforded to third parties for use of existing cable television networks and have imposed access obligations in certain countries.
This has resulted, for example, in obligations with respect to call termination for our telephony business in Europe, video must
carry obligations in many markets in which we operate and video and broadband internet access obligations in Belgium.

    When we acquire additional communications companies, these acquisitions may require the approval of governmental
authorities (either at country or, in the case of the E.U., European level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an
acquisition, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely
manner, the governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative
measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations.

     New legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regimes applicable to us, which could adversely affect our competitive
position and profitability, and we may become subject to more extensive regulation if we are deemed to possess significant
market power in any of the markets in which we operate. Significant changes to the existing regulatory regimes applicable to
the provision of cable television, telephony, internet and mobile services have been and are still being introduced. For example,
in the E.U. a large element of regulation affecting our business derives from a number of Directives that are the basis of the
regulatory regimes concerning many of the services we offer across the E.U. The various Directives require Member States to
harmonize their laws on communications and cover issues such as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives
are reviewed by the E.U. from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our
businesses are regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, we are subject to review by competition or national
regulatory authorities in certain countries concerning whether we exhibit Significant Market Power. A finding of Significant Market
Power can result in our company becoming subject to pricing, open access, unbundling and other requirements that could provide
a more favorable operating environment for existing and potential competitors.

     The U.K. referendum advising for the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved,
on an advisory basis, an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Failing the implementation of an agreed extension,
the U.K. will leave the E.U. on March 29, 2019. The potential impacts, if any, of the considerable uncertainty relating to Brexit
or the resulting terms of Brexit on the free movement of goods, services, people, data and capital between the U.K. and the E.U.,
customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters are unclear.
Examples of the impact Brexit could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations include:

    •    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the capital markets. For example, a sustained period of
         weakness in the British pound sterling or the euro could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, including our ability to
         fund repurchases of our equity securities and other U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements;

    •    legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws and
         directives to replace or replicate, or where previously implemented by enactment of U.K. laws or regulations, to retain,
         amend or repeal; and

    •    various geopolitical forces may impact the global economy and our business, including, for example, other E.U. member
         states (in particular those member states where we have operations) proposing referendums to, or electing to, exit the
         E.U.

     We cannot be certain that we will be successful with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, partnerships or other similar
transactions, or that we will achieve the anticipated benefits thereof. Historically, our businesses have grown, in part, through
selective acquisitions that enabled them to take advantage of existing networks, local service offerings and region-specific

                                                                 I-38
management expertise, and we have also taken advantage of attractive opportunities to sell select businesses. We expect to seek
to continue improving our company through attractive acquisitions, dispositions, partnerships or other similar transactions in
selected markets, such as the SFR BeLux acquisition in June 2017, the UPC Austria disposition in July 2018 and the pending sales
of the Vodafone Disposal Group, the operations of UPC DTH and UPC Switzerland. Our ability to complete any such transaction
may be limited by many factors, including government regulation, availability of financing, our or our counterparty’s debt
covenants, the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential targets, acquirers, or partners, and competition from
other potential acquirers, including private equity funds. Even if we are successful in completing such transactions, integration
and separation activities may present significant costs and challenges. We cannot be assured that we will be successful with respect
to acquisitions, dispositions, partnerships or other similar transactions or realizing the anticipated benefits thereof, including for,
example, the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group.

     In addition, we anticipate that most, if not all, companies acquired by us will be located outside the U.S. Foreign companies
may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as
those required by U.S. securities laws. While we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence and to implement appropriate controls
and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies’
disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting until we have fully integrated them.

     We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such
as value added tax (VAT) in the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. In addition, most tax jurisdictions
that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services, cross-border payments
between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax, VAT and transfer tax. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities
in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any material differences
as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results
of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made.

     We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, including treaties
between and among the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions in which we have a presence. Also, various income tax
proposals in the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are
calculated. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher
income or non-income tax expense, and any such material changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. In this
regard, there have been significant changes or proposed changes to the tax laws in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate,
the impacts of which have been reflected accordingly in our financial statements.

    Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the base erosion and
profit shifting project that has been undertaken by the OECD or the European Commission Anti-Tax Avoidance Package. The
OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that encompass most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the
European Commission have undertaken studies and are publishing action plans that include recommendations aimed at addressing
what they believe are issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by companies. It is possible that jurisdictions in
which we do business could react to these initiatives or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect
us or our shareholders through increasing our tax liabilities.

Factors Relating to Certain Financial Matters

     Our substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects. We seek to
maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek
to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that is between four
and five times our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. As a result, we are highly leveraged. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding
principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our capital lease obligations aggregated $29.9 billion, including $3.6
billion that is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet and $22.7 billion that is not due until 2024 or thereafter. We
believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to
fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we
anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, we completed refinancing transactions
during 2018 that, among other things, resulted in the extension of certain of our subsidiaries’ debt maturities. No assurance can
be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it
is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments
could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position.


                                                                 I-39
     Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements
and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted OIBDA of our
operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our
ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the incurrence-based leverage covenants contained in the various debt
instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted OIBDA of our subsidiary, UPC Holding, were to decline, our
ability to obtain additional debt could be limited. Accordingly, if our cash provided by operations declines or we encounter other
material liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to meet our debt obligations
and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional
debt financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, property and equipment additions, or other general corporate
requirements. We can give no assurance that any additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms that are as favorable
as the terms of our existing debt or at all. Further, our board of directors has approved share repurchase programs for Liberty
Global. Any cash used by our company in connection with any future purchases of our ordinary shares would not be available for
other purposes, including the repayment of debt. For additional information concerning our share repurchase programs, see note
13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various debt instruments that contain restrictions on how we finance our operations
and operate our businesses, which could impede our ability to engage in beneficial transactions. Certain of our subsidiaries are
subject to significant financial and operating restrictions contained in outstanding credit agreements, indentures and similar
instruments of indebtedness. These restrictions will affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things,
the ability of those subsidiaries to:

    •    incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

    •    pay dividends or make other upstream distributions;

    •    make investments;

    •    transfer, sell or dispose of certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

    •    merge or consolidate with other entities;

    •    engage in transactions with us or other affiliates; or

    •    create liens on their assets.

    As a result of restrictions contained in these debt instruments, the companies party thereto, and their subsidiaries, could be
unable to obtain additional capital in the future to:

    •    fund property and equipment additions or acquisitions that could improve their value;

    •    meet their loan and capital commitments to their business affiliates;

    •    invest in companies in which they would otherwise invest;

    •    fund any operating losses or future development of their business affiliates;

    •    obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize
         their assets; or

    •    conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities.

     In addition, most of the credit agreements to which these subsidiaries are parties include financial covenants that require them,
in certain circumstances, to maintain certain leverage and other financial ratios. Their ability to meet these financial covenants
may be affected by adverse economic, competitive, or regulatory developments and other events beyond their control, and we
cannot assure you that these financial covenants will be met. In the event of a default under such subsidiaries’ credit agreements
or indentures, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under those agreements or indentures, which could
result in a default under other outstanding credit facilities or indentures. We cannot assure you that any of these subsidiaries will
have sufficient assets to pay indebtedness outstanding under their credit agreements and indentures. Any refinancing of this
indebtedness is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants.



                                                                  I-40
     We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the debt service obligation of our subsidiaries.
We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries,
which are indexed to EURIBOR, LIBOR or other base rates. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage
exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost
or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market
interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated
with our leveraged capital structure.

     In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop
compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact transitional
arrangements for calculating applicable reference rates that may be made in the U.K., the U.S., the Eurozone or elsewhere given
that a number of outcomes are possible, including the cessation of the publication of one or more reference rates. Our loan documents
contain provisions that contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate applicable to our LIBOR-indexed debt to the extent
LIBOR is not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what would have
been calculated under LIBOR. Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our
loan documents in the event that the LIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies
to our LIBOR-indexed debt could be different than any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed derivative instruments.
We anticipate managing this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/
or derivative instruments, however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications
and/or the company may incur significant associated costs.

     We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations. While
our operations attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in programming and operating costs, there is no
assurance that they will be able to do so. In certain countries in which we operate, our ability to increase subscription rates is
subject to regulatory controls. Also, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by competitive pressures.
Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and
net earnings (loss). We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs in
certain of our markets.

     Continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in the global economy and in the countries in which we operate may
adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current macroeconomic environment is highly
volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including the ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues,
the risk of deflation and the stability of the British pound sterling and the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic
environment. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of
measures by the E.U. Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the eurozone.
As a result, we cannot predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which we operate
may deteriorate. Additional risks arising from the ongoing economic challenges in Europe are described below under the Risk
Factor titled: We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity,
financial condition and cash flows.

     Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our subscribers and/or the prices we are able to charge
for our products and services, and, as a result, it may be (1) more difficult for us to attract new subscribers, (2) more likely that
subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (3) more difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Countries
may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our company.
Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, RGUs, mobile subscribers, Adjusted
OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic
environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse
effects.

     We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial
condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For
example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several countries in which we or our affiliates operate, combined with weak
growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign
debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit
and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. With regard to currency instability issues,
concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect
to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific
fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the
exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries,

                                                                  I-41
or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result in the
redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new
currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of our assets, liabilities and
cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination
event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would
likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone countries, which in turn could have
an adverse impact on demand for our products and services, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any
changes from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing and
other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a time frame that would
allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have
to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination
event could have a material adverse impact on our company.

     We may not freely access the cash of our operating companies. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our
current sources of corporate liquidity include (1) our cash and cash equivalents and (2) interest and dividend income received on
our cash and cash equivalents and investments. From time to time, we also receive (1) proceeds in the form of distributions or
loan repayments from our subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets and
(3) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity securities. The ability of our operating subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory,
regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and in some cases our receipt of such payments
or advances may be limited due to tax considerations or the presence of noncontrolling interests. Most of our operating subsidiaries
are subject to credit agreements or indentures that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the
making of distributions, loans or advances to shareholders and partners, including us. In addition, because these subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities they have no obligation to provide us funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends,
distributions, loans or other payments.

     We are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparties to our derivative and other financial instruments, undrawn debt
facilities and cash investments. Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our derivative and other financial
instruments, cash investments and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that our counterparties will default on their
obligations to us. While we regularly review our credit exposures and currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness
of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our
counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance of default or failure could have
an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (1) we may incur
losses to the extent that we are unable to recover debts owed to us, including cash deposited and the value of financial losses, (2)
we may incur significant costs to recover amounts owed to us, and such recovery may take a long period of time or may not be
possible at all, (3) our derivative liabilities may be accelerated by the default of our counterparty, (4) we may be exposed to financial
risks as a result of the termination of affected derivative contracts, and it may be costly or impossible to replace such contracts or
otherwise mitigate such risks, (5) amounts available under committed credit facilities may be reduced and (6) disruption to the
credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.

     At December 31, 2018, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (1) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of
$617.3 million, (2) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,498.3 million and (3) aggregate undrawn debt
facilities of $2,503.8 million. For additional information on our derivative contracts, see note 8 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Our interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV is held pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement that contains provisions relating to
governance as well as transfer and exit rights, which, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of our
company. Our non-controlling interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV is held pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement (the Shareholders
Agreement), which provides the terms of the governance of the VodafoneZiggo JV, including among others, decision-making
process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. These provisions may prevent the VodafoneZiggo JV
from making decisions or taking actions that would protect or advance the interests of our company, and could even result in the
VodafoneZiggo JV making decisions or taking actions that adversely impact our company. Further, our ability to access the cash
of the VodafoneZiggo JV pursuant to the dividend policy contained in the Shareholders Agreement may be restricted in certain
circumstances. The Shareholders Agreement also provides for restrictions on the transfer of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV,
which could adversely affect our ability to sell our interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV and/or the prices at which our interest may
be sold, as well as certain exit arrangements, which could force us to sell our interest. For additional information on the
VodafoneZiggo JV and the Shareholders Agreement, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.


                                                                  I-42
     We may not report net earnings. We reported earnings (loss) from continuing operations of ($1,411.5 million), ($2,350.0
million) and $1,650.3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In light of our historical financial performance, we cannot
assure you that we will report net earnings in the near future.

Other Factors

     We have not historically paid any cash dividends, and we may not pay dividends equally or at all on any class of our
ordinary shares. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on any class of our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future.
However, we have the right to pay dividends, effect securities distributions or make bonus issues on Liberty Global Shares. In
addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of Liberty Global Shares will reduce our “distributable reserves” (defined
as our accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses, as measured for U.K. statutory purposes) legally available
to be paid as dividends by our company under English law on any of our ordinary shares.

     Our share price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell our ordinary shares at or above the price you
paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of each class of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous
factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

    •    actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;

    •    actual operating or financial results that vary from our guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

    •    changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and
         investors;

    •    actual or anticipated future sales of our ordinary shares by us, our senior management or our other existing shareholders?

    •    investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general?

    •    announcements by us or our competitors of significant services or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic
         partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments?

    •    changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our competitors?

    •    price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole?

    •    media coverage of our business and financial performance? and

    •    general domestic and international economic and political conditions.

    The stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect
the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In particular, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a
whole may affect the market price of our ordinary shares in ways that may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating
performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares, regardless
of our actual operating performance.

    Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall
market and in the market price of a company’s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs,
divert our management’s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

    The loss of certain key personnel could harm our business. We have experienced employees at both the corporate and
operational levels who possess substantial knowledge of our business and operations. We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue
costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions in our business operations,
which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

    John C. Malone has significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our shareholders. John C.
Malone beneficially owns outstanding ordinary shares of Liberty Global representing 29.3% of our aggregate voting power as of
February 13, 2019. By virtue of Mr. Malone’s voting power in our company, as well as his position as Chairman of our board of

                                                                 I-43
directors, Mr. Malone may have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to
our shareholders for approval. For example, under English law and our articles of association, certain matters (including
amendments to the articles of association) require the approval of 75% of the shareholders who vote (in person or by proxy) on
the relevant resolution, and other certain corporate transactions or matters may require the approval of at least 75% of the outstanding
shares of each class of our ordinary shares. Because Mr. Malone beneficially owns approximately 29.3% of our aggregate voting
power and more than 75% of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares of Liberty Global, he has the ability to prevent the requisite
approval threshold from being met even though the other shareholders may determine that such action or transaction is beneficial
for the company. Mr. Malone’s rights to vote or dispose of his equity interests in our company are not subject to any restrictions
in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary transfer restrictions pursuant to equity
award agreements.

    It may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions
of our articles of association and of English law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company that a
shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:

    •    authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of ordinary shares; a Class B that entitles the holders to 10 votes per
         share; a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share; and a Class C that, except as otherwise required by applicable
         law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;

    •    authorizing the issuance of “blank check” shares (both ordinary and preference), which could be issued by our board of
         directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;

    •    classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control
         of our board of directors, although under English law, shareholders of our company can remove a director without cause
         by ordinary resolution;

    •    prohibiting shareholder action by written resolution, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of
         the shareholders;

    •    requiring the approval of 75% in value of the shareholders (or class of shareholders) and/or English court approval for
         certain statutory mergers or schemes of arrangements; and

    •    establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for
         proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.

     Change in control provisions in our incentive plans and related award agreements or in executive employment agreements
may also discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company, even if such change of control would be in the best
interests of our shareholders.

     The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult. Because we are a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S.
courts than would currently be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. It may also be more difficult (or
impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts sitting in England than it would be to bring similar claims against
a U.S. company in a U.S. court. In particular, English law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of
English companies may bring derivative actions. Under English law generally, only the company can be the proper plaintiff in
proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against us. Our articles of association provide for the exclusive jurisdiction of
the English courts for shareholder lawsuits against us or our directors.

Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

    None.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

    We lease our corporate offices in London, U.K., in Denver, Colorado, U.S. and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All of our
other real or personal property is owned or leased by our subsidiaries and affiliates.

     Our subsidiaries and affiliates own or lease the fixed assets necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, including
office space, transponder space, headend facilities, rights of way, cable television and telecommunications distribution equipment,
telecommunications switches, base stations, cell towers and customer premises equipment and other property necessary for their
operations. The physical components of their broadband networks require maintenance and periodic upgrades to support the new
services and products they introduce. Subject to these maintenance and upgrade activities, our management believes that our
current facilities are suitable and adequate for our business operations for the foreseeable future.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, our subsidiaries and affiliates have become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of their
operations in the normal course of business. For additional information, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in
Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Market Information

     Our share capital comprises Liberty Global Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares, which trade on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market under the symbols “LBTYA,” “LBTYB,” and “LBTYK,” respectively. Share price information for securities traded
on the Nasdaq Global Select Market can be found on the Nasdaq’s website at www.nasdaq.com.

    The following table sets forth the quarterly range of high and low sales prices of Liberty Global Class B ordinary shares for

        number of less significant acquisitions during the years presented. On December 31, 2016, we completed the VodafoneZiggo
        JV Transaction, pursuant to which we contributed VodafoneZiggo Holding to the VodafoneZiggo JV. In addition, we acquired
        C&W on May 16, 2016 and a less significant cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico on June 3, 2015, each
        of which was attributed to the LiLAC Group. Effective December 31, 2017, we completed the Split-off Transaction, pursuant
        to which the businesses, assets and liabilities of the LiLAC Group were transferred to an independent publicly-traded
        company. Accordingly, the selected financial data included in this table presents the LiLAC Group as discontinued operations
        for all applicable periods. For information regarding our acquisitions and dispositions during the past three years, see notes
        5 and 6, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements.

OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis, which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, is

Overview

  General

     We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile communications services to
residential customers and businesses in Europe. Our continuing operations currently provide residential and B2B communications
services in (i) the U.K. and Ireland through Virgin Media, (ii) Belgium through Telenet and (iii) Switzerland, Poland and Slovakia
through UPC Holding. In addition, following the December 31, 2016 completion of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, we own
a 50% noncontrolling interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which provides residential and B2B communications services in the
Netherlands. During 2016, we provided residential and B2B communications services in the Netherlands through our wholly-
owned subsidiary, VodafoneZiggo Holding.

     As further described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, we (i) completed the sale of our operations in Austria
on July 31, 2018, (ii) reached an agreement on May 9, 2018 to sell our operations in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech
Republic (exclusive of our DTH operations), (iii) reached an agreement on December 21, 2018 to sell the operations of UPC DTH
and (iv) completed the Split-off Transaction on December 29, 2017. Accordingly, (a) our operations in Austria, Germany, Romania,
Hungary and the Czech Republic and the operations of UPC DTH are presented as discontinued operations for all periods and (b)
the entities comprising the LiLAC Group are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows for 2017 and 2016. In the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.

Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Strategy and Management Focus

    From a strategic perspective, we are seeking to build broadband communications and mobile businesses that have strong
prospects for future growth. As discussed further under Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization below, we also seek to
maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk.

    We strive to achieve organic revenue and customer growth in our operations by developing and marketing bundled
entertainment and information and communications services, and extending and upgrading the quality of our networks where
appropriate. As we use the term, organic growth excludes foreign currency translation effects (FX) and the estimated impact of
acquisitions and dispositions. While we seek to increase our customer base, we also seek to maximize the average revenue we
receive from each household by increasing the penetration of our digital video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile
services with existing customers through product bundling and upselling.

    We currently are engaged in certain network extension programs across our footprint, which we collectively refer to as the
“Network Extensions.” During 2018, pursuant to the Network Extensions, our continuing operations connected approximately
657,000 additional residential and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks, including approximately
481,000 residential and commercial premises connected by Virgin Media in the U.K. and Ireland. We expect to continue the
Network Extensions in 2019. Depending on a variety of factors, including the financial and operational results of our new build
programs, the Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion.

    The capital costs associated with the Network Extensions, which include the costs to build out the networks and the purchase
and installation of related customer premises equipment, are expected to be significant. For information regarding our expected
property and equipment additions during 2019, see Liquidity and Capital Resources — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
below.

    Our assessment of the impacts of the Network Extensions are subject to competitive, economic, regulatory and other factors
outside of our control.

  Competition and Other External Factors

    We are experiencing significant competition from incumbent telecommunications operators, DTH operators and/or other
providers in all of our markets. For additional information regarding the competition we face, see Item 1. Business - Competition
and - Regulatory Matters included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The significant competition we are experiencing,
together with macroeconomic and regulatory factors, has adversely impacted our revenue, RGUs and/or average monthly
subscription revenue per average cable RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable (ARPU), particularly in Switzerland and Belgium.
In addition, the VodafoneZiggo JV is facing significant competition in the Netherlands, particularly with respect to its mobile
operations. For additional information regarding the revenue impact of changes in the RGUs and ARPU of our consolidated
reportable segments, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments below.

     In addition to competition, our operations are subject to macroeconomic, political and other risks that are outside of our
control. For example, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which U.K. citizens voted in favor of, on an advisory basis,
an exit from the E.U. commonly referred to as “Brexit.” Failing the implementation of an agreed extension, the U.K. will leave
the E.U. on March 29, 2019 under a so-called “hard Brexit” or “no-deal Brexit” without agreements on trade, finance and other
key elements. The foregoing has caused considerable uncertainty as to Brexit’s impact on the free movement of goods, services,
people, data and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange
rates and availability of capital. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity. For additional information regarding the potential impact of Brexit on our company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors
included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

                                                                  II-6
Results of Operations

    We have completed a number of transactions that impact the comparability of our 2018, 2017 and 2016 results of operations,
the most notable of which is the SFR BeLux Acquisition on June 19, 2017. For further information, see note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements.

     On December 31, 2016, we completed the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, whereby we contributed VodafoneZiggo Holding
and its subsidiaries (including Ziggo Sport) to the VodafoneZiggo JV. Accordingly, our results of operations for 2016 include the
operations of VodafoneZiggo Holding and its subsidiaries. In our segment presentation for 2016, VodafoneZiggo Holding (exclusive
of Ziggo Sport, which became a subsidiary of VodafoneZiggo Holding in October 2016) is separately reported as “The Netherlands”,
and Ziggo Sport is included in Central and Corporate. For additional information regarding the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction,
see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

     In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of acquisitions (the Acquisition Impact) on our operating
results. The Acquisition Impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results of the periods under
comparison that is attributable to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the Acquisition Impact on an acquired entity’s
operating results during the first three to twelve months following the acquisition date, as adjusted to remove integration costs
and any other material unusual or nonoperational items, such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are
considered to be organic changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, (i) organic variances attributed to an acquired entity
during the first 12 months following the acquisition date represent differences between the Acquisition Impact and the actual
results and (ii) the calculation of our organic change percentages includes the organic activity of an acquired entity relative to the
Acquisition Impact of such entity. In our below comparison of 2017 to 2016, we also quantify the impact of the VodafoneZiggo
JV Transaction on our results of operations. In this regard, our organic changes in the 2017 to 2016 comparison are adjusted to
exclude (a) the operations of VodafoneZiggo Holding and Ziggo Sport during 2016, (b) the revenue earned during 2017 from
services provided to the VodafoneZiggo JV and (c) certain operating and SG&A expenses incurred during 2017 that were allocated
to our Netherlands segment during 2016.

     Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as all of our operating
segments have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to FX risk during the three months ended
December 31, 2018 was to the British pound sterling and euro as 52.9% and 32.4% of our reported revenue during the period was
derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the British pound sterling and euro, respectively. In addition, our reported
operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for certain other local currencies in Europe. The portions of the
changes in the various components of our results of operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Discussion
and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below. For
information regarding our foreign currency risks and the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the periods
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency
Risk below.

     The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100% of each of our consolidated reportable segment’s revenue and
Adjusted OIBDA. As we have the ability to control Telenet, we consolidate 100% of its revenue and expenses in our consolidated
statements of operations despite the fact that third parties own a significant interest. The noncontrolling owners’ interests in the
operating results of Telenet and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable
to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations.

     As further described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using
the cumulative effect transition method. As such, the information included in our consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto for 2017 and 2016 has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for such
years. In order to provide a more meaningful comparison of our results of operations, in the following discussion and analysis of
our results of operations for 2018, as compared to 2017, we present our revenue, expenses and Adjusted OIBDA for 2017 on a
pro forma basis that gives effect to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 as if such adoption had occurred on January 1, 2017. However,
in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations for 2017, as compared to 2016, we present all amounts on a historical
basis.




                                                                 II-7
     The following table presents (i) the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA of our
consolidated reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2018 and (ii) the pro forma impact of the adoption of ASU
2014-09 on the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA of our consolidated reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2017 as
if such adoption had occurred on January 1, 2017.

Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments

  General

     All of our reportable segments derive their revenue primarily from residential and B2B communications services, including
video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. For detailed information regarding the composition of our
reportable segments and how we define and categorize our revenue components, see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
For information regarding the results of operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV, refer to Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated
Operating Results - Share of results of affiliates below.

     The tables presented below in this section provide the details of the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA of our consolidated reportable
segments for (i) 2018, as compared to 2017, and (ii) 2017, as compared to 2016. As discussed above, in our comparison of 2018
to 2017, amounts for 2017 are presented on a pro forma basis that gives effect to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 as if such adoption
had occurred on January 1, 2017. In our comparison of 2017 to 2016, all amounts are presented on a historical basis. These tables
present (a) the amounts reported for the current and comparative periods, (b) the reported U.S. dollar change and percentage change
from period to period and (c) the organic U.S. dollar change and percentage change from period to period. For our organic
comparisons, which exclude the impact of FX, we assume that exchange rates remained constant at the prior-period rate during
all periods presented. We also provide a table showing the Adjusted OIBDA margins of our consolidated reportable segments for
2018, 2017 and 2016 at the end of this section.

     Most of our revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer VAT or similar revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these
taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such
tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience
increases in our operating costs and expenses and corresponding declines in our Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margins
to the extent of any such tax increases.

     We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers terminate on
another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from their customers terminate on
our networks or networks that we access through MVNO or other arrangements. The amounts we charge and incur with respect
to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are subject to regulatory oversight. To the extent that regulatory authorities
introduce fixed-line or mobile termination rate changes, we would experience prospective changes and, in very limited cases, we
could experience retroactive changes in our interconnect revenue and/or costs. The ultimate impact of any such changes in
termination rates on our Adjusted OIBDA would be dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are subject to the changed
termination rates.

     We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to certain costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to costs
and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of our consolidated reportable
segments (non-functional currency expenses). Any cost increases that we are not able to pass on to our subscribers through rate
increases would result in increased pressure on our operating margins. For additional information regarding our foreign currency
exchange risks see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below.




                                                                 II-9
  Revenue of our Consolidated Reportable Segments

     General. While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our consolidated reportable
segments, we are experiencing significant competition in all of our markets. This competition has an adverse impact on our ability
to increase or maintain our RGUs and/or ARPU.

     Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of RGUs
or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (a) changes
in prices, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber
usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of cable and mobile products within a segment during the period. In the following discussion,
we discuss ARPU changes in terms of the net impact of the above factors on the ARPU that is derived from our video, broadband
internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile products.

_______________

(a)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable to
         increases in the average number of broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) a net increase due
         to (a) higher ARPU from broadband internet services, (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (c) higher
         ARPU from video services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in residential cable non-subscription revenue is primarily driven by changes in the U.K., including the net
         effect of (i) increases in interconnect revenue and late fees and (ii) a decrease in cancellation revenue.

(d)      The decrease in residential mobile subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in the
         U.K., due primarily to lower ARPU, and (ii) an increase in Ireland, mainly due to an increase in the average number of
         mobile subscribers. The increase in residential mobile non-subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in revenue
         from mobile handset sales in the U.K., which typically generate relatively low margins.

(e)      The increase in B2B subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of broadband internet
         SOHO subscribers in the U.K. The increase in B2B non-subscription revenue is primarily driven by changes in the U.K.,
         including the net effect of (i) higher revenue related to business network services, (ii) a decrease in interconnect revenue,
         (iii) lower revenue from wholesale fixed-line telephony services and (iv) lower revenue from data services.

(f)      The increase in other revenue is primarily due to an increase in broadcasting revenue in Ireland.

_______________

(a)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable
         to declines in the average number of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) the net effect of (a)
         higher ARPU from broadband internet and video services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (ii)
         an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The decrease in residential cable non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease of $5.6
         million related to adjustments recorded during 2017 to reflect the expected recovery of certain prior-period VAT payments,
         (ii) an increase in distribution revenue, (iii) a decrease in late fees and (iv) a decrease in revenue from equipment sales.

(d)      The decrease in residential mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower ARPU and (ii) an
         increase in the average number of mobile subscribers. The decrease in residential mobile non-subscription revenue is
         primarily attributable to decreases in (a) revenue from the sales of mobile handsets and other devices and (b) interconnect
         revenue.

(e)      The increase in B2B subscription revenue is attributable to (i) higher ARPU, as increases in mobile and video SOHO services
         were only partially offset by a decrease in broadband internet SOHO services, and (ii) an increase in the average number
         of SOHO subscribers, as increases in broadband internet and video SOHO subscribers were only partially offset by a
         decrease in mobile subscribers. The increase in B2B non-subscription revenue is primarily due to (a) higher revenue from
         wholesale services and (b) an increase in interconnect revenue.

_______________

(a)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable
         to the net effect of (i) declines in the average number of video and broadband internet RGUs and (ii) an increase in the
         average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to lower ARPU
         from video, fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services.

(c)      The increase in residential cable non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a $13.6 million
         increase in distribution revenue associated with the September 2017 launch of our Swiss sports channels and (ii) a decrease
         of $6.4 million due to the impact of unclaimed customer credit accruals that were released during the first half of 2017.

(d)      The increase in residential mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of mobile
         subscribers.

(e)      The increase in B2B non-subscription revenue is primarily due to (i) an increase in interconnect revenue and (ii) higher
         revenue from data services.

_______________

(a)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is primarily
         attributable to the net effect of (i) increases in the average number of broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony
         RGUs in the U.K. and (ii) a decrease in the average number of video RGUs in Ireland.

(b)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) the net effect of (a)
         higher ARPU from broadband internet services and (b) lower ARPU from video and fixed-line telephony services and (ii)
         an improvement in RGU mix. In addition, ARPU from video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services was
         adversely impacted by an aggregate revenue decrease of $12.4 million associated with an April 2016 change in the regulations
                                                                                            II-15
         governing payment handling fees that Virgin Media charges to its customers in the U.K.

(c)      The increase in residential cable non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in
         installation revenue in the U.K. and (ii) a decrease in early termination fees in the U.K.

(d)      The decrease in residential mobile subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in the
         U.K., due primarily to lower ARPU, and (ii) an increase in Ireland, mainly due to an increase in the average number of
         mobile subscribers. The lower ARPU in the U.K. includes the net effect of (a) a decline of $104.8 million attributable to a
         lower number of customers under higher-ARPU subsidized handset contracts and (b) an increase of $42.5 million attributable
         to growth in the number of customers under lower-ARPU contracts that provided for two distinct contractual relationships
         associated with mobile handsets and mobile airtime services. The increase in residential mobile non-subscription revenue
         is primarily due to (1) an increase in revenue from mobile handset sales in the U.K. and (2) a decrease in interconnect
         revenue, as a decrease in the U.K. was only partially offset by a volume-related increase in Ireland. The decrease in
         interconnect revenue in the U.K. is primarily due to (I) a decline in mobile short message service or “SMS” termination
         volumes and (II) lower mobile termination rates and volumes.

(e)      The increase in B2B subscription revenue is primarily due to an increase in the average number of broadband internet
         SOHO RGUs in the U.K. The increase in B2B non-subscription revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase
         in early termination fees in the U.K. and (ii) lower revenue from data services in the U.K.

(f)      The increase in other revenue is largely due to an increase in broadcasting revenue in Ireland.

_______________

(a)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable
         to decreases in the average number of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is attributable to (i) the net effect of (a)
         higher ARPU from video and broadband internet services and (b) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (ii)
         an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in residential cable non-subscription revenue is attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase of $5.8 million
         due to adjustments recorded during 2017 to reflect the expected recovery of certain prior-period VAT payments and (ii) a
         decrease in revenue from services provided over third-party networks.

(d)      The decrease in residential mobile subscription revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decline in the average
         number of mobile subscribers, as a decrease in the average number of prepaid mobile subscribers was only partially offset
                                                                II-16
         by an increase in the average number of postpaid mobile subscribers, and (ii) higher ARPU. The decrease in residential
         mobile non-subscription revenue is primarily due to (a) a decrease in revenue from sales of mobile handsets and other
         devices and (b) a decrease in interconnect revenue due to the net effect of lower SMS termination volumes, higher roaming
         revenue and lower mobile termination rates.

(e)      The increase in B2B subscription revenue is attributable to increases in the average number of mobile, broadband internet,
         video and fixed-line telephony SOHO subscribers. The increase in B2B non-subscription revenue is primarily due to the
         net effect of (i) lower revenue from mobile services, (ii) higher revenue from wholesale services, (iii) an increase in revenue
         from hosting and managed security services and (iv) an increase in interconnect revenue driven by higher mobile volumes.

_______________

(a)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is attributable
         to the net effect of (i) declines in the average number of video and broadband internet RGUs and (ii) an increase in the
         average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs.

(b)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to lower ARPU
         from fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and video services.

(c)      The increase in residential cable non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a $19.3 million
         increase in distribution revenue associated with the September 2017 launch of our Swiss sport channels, (ii) a decrease in
         installation revenue and (iii) a decrease in equipment sales. In addition, the increase in residential cable non-subscription
         revenue includes a $6.5 million favorable impact of the release of unclaimed customer credits during the first half of 2017.

(d)      The increase in residential mobile subscription revenue is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of
         mobile subscribers and (ii) lower ARPU.

(e)      The increase in B2B subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of broadband
         internet SOHO RGUs. The increase in B2B non-subscription revenue is primarily due to (i) higher revenue from data
         services, (ii) higher revenue from construction services provided to our partner networks and (iii) an increase in interconnect
         revenue.

_______________

(a)      The increase in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is primarily
         attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs, primarily due to an
         increase in Poland, and (ii) a decrease in the average number of video RGUs, primarily due to a decrease in Slovakia.

(b)      The decrease in residential cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily attributable to (i) the net
         effect of (a) higher ARPU from video services, primarily due to an increase in Poland, (b) lower ARPU from broadband
         internet services, primarily due to a decrease in Poland, and (c) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services, primarily
         due to a decrease in Poland, and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c)      The increase in residential cable non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in Poland.

(d)      The increase in B2B subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of broadband

_______________

(a)     Residential cable subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services and the recognition
        of deferred installation revenue over the associated contract period. Residential cable non-subscription revenue includes,
        among other items, channel carriage fees, late fees and revenue from the sale of equipment.

(b)     Residential subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(c)     Residential mobile subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential
        mobile non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, interconnect revenue and revenue from sales of mobile
        handsets and other devices. Residential mobile interconnect revenue was $253.6 million and $253.0 million during 2018
        and 2017, respectively.


                                                                                 II-21
(d)      B2B subscription revenue represents revenue from SOHO subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive
         expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or
         similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. A portion of the increases in our B2B subscription
         revenue is attributable to the conversion of certain residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers. B2B non-subscription
         revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony, mobile and data services offered
         to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators.

(e)      Other revenue includes, among other items, revenue earned from the JV Services, broadcasting revenue in Ireland and
         revenue from Central and Corporate’s wholesale handset program. In addition, the amount for 2018 includes revenue earned
         from (i) sales of customer premises equipment to the VodafoneZiggo JV and (ii) transitional and other services provided to
         Deutsche Telekom and Liberty Latin America.

     Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $703.0 million or 6.2% during 2018, as compared to 2017. This increase
includes (i) an increase of $70.4 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $29.1 million attributable
to the impact of dispositions. On an organic basis, our consolidated revenue increased $239.0 million or 2.1%.

    Residential revenue. The details of the pro forma changes in our consolidated residential revenue for 2018, as compared to
2017, are as follows (in millions):

Increase (decrease) in residential cable subscription revenue due to change in:
  Average number of RGUs ...................................................................................................................................... $              (14.8)
  ARPU .....................................................................................................................................................................     7.3

Decrease in residential mobile subscription revenue................................................................................................                            (15.8)
Increase in residential mobile non-subscription revenue..........................................................................................                               60.8
     Total organic increase in residential revenue....................................................................................................                          34.7
Net impact of acquisitions and disposals..................................................................................................................                      (1.3)
Impact of FX.............................................................................................................................................................      325.9
     Total increase in residential revenue................................................................................................................. $                  359.3

     On an organic basis, our consolidated residential cable subscription revenue decreased $7.5 million or 0.1% during 2018, as
compared to 2017. This decrease is attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase from broadband internet services of $111.2
million or 3.7%, attributable to higher ARPU and an increase in the average number of RGUs, (ii) a decrease from fixed-line
telephony services of $67.5 million or 4.2%, attributable to the net effect of lower ARPU and an increase in the average number
of RGUs, and (iii) a decrease from video services of $51.2 million or 1.8%, attributable to the net effect of a decrease in the average
number of RGUs and higher ARPU.

     On an organic basis, our consolidated residential cable non-subscription revenue decreased $2.8 million or 1.0% during 2018,
as compared to 2017. This decrease is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in Belgium and (ii) increases in the
U.K. and Switzerland.

     On an organic basis, our consolidated residential mobile subscription revenue decreased $15.8 million or 1.6% during 2018,
as compared to 2017. This decrease is primarily due the net effect of (i) declines in Belgium and the U.K. and (ii) an increase in
Switzerland.

    On an organic basis, our consolidated residential mobile non-subscription revenue increased $60.8 million or 10.0% during
2018, as compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue from low-margin sales of mobile handsets and
other devices, as an increase in the U.K. was only partially offset by a decrease in Belgium.

    B2B revenue. On an organic basis, our consolidated B2B subscription revenue increased $61.2 million or 16.6% during 2018
respectively, as compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to increases in SOHO revenue in the U.K., Belgium and Poland.

     On an organic basis, our consolidated B2B non-subscription revenue increased $73.8 million or 5.2% during 2018 respectively,
as compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to increases in Belgium and Switzerland.


                                                                                           II-22
    Other revenue. On an organic basis, our consolidated other revenue increased $69.3 million or 29.1% during 2018 respectively,
as compared to 2017. This increase is primarily due to (i) revenue of $57.2 million that was earned from the sale of customer
premises equipment to the VodafoneZiggo JV, which began during the second quarter of 2018 and typically generate low margins,
and (ii) an increase in broadcasting revenue in Ireland.

  Programming and other direct costs of services

     Programming and other direct costs of services include programming and copyright costs, interconnect and access costs, costs
of mobile handsets and other devices and other direct costs related to our operations. Programming and copyright costs, which
represent a significant portion of our operating costs, are expected to rise in future periods as a result of (i) higher costs associated
with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide
for the broadcast of live sporting events, (ii) rate increases and (iii) growth in the number of our enhanced video subscribers.

     Our programming and other direct costs of services increased $271.5 million or 9.1% during 2018, as compared to 2017. This
increase includes (i) an increase of $18.3 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions and (ii) a decrease of $20.8 million
attributable to the impact of dispositions. On an organic basis, our programming and other direct costs of services increased $164.5
million or 5.5%. This increase includes the following factors:

     •     An increase in programming and copyright costs of $70.1 million or 4.6%, primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland
           and Switzerland. This increase is primarily due to higher costs for certain premium and/or basic content, including (i) a
           $27.8 million increase in costs associated with sports rights in Switzerland and (ii) a $10.3 million increase in costs
           associated with broadcasting rights in Ireland. The increase in the costs for sports rights in Switzerland is due to the
           acquisition of the rights to carry live sporting events in connection with the September 2017 launch of our Swiss sports
           channels. Approximately half of the annual programming costs and the operating and capital costs associated with the
           production of the related Swiss sports channels are recovered from the revenue earned from the distribution of these
           sports channels to other cable operators;

     •     Higher cost of sales of $51.2 million in Central and Corporate related to customer premises equipment sold to the
           VodafoneZiggo JV;

     •     An increase in mobile handset and other device costs of $35.9 million or 11.0%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a
           higher average cost per handset sold in U.K./Ireland and (ii) lower mobile handset and other device sales volumes,
           primarily due to decreases in U.K./Ireland and Belgium;

     •     An increase in interconnect and access costs of $16.5 million or 1.9%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower MVNO
           costs, as a decrease in Belgium of $46.5 million was only partially offset by an increase in Switzerland of $9.0 million,
           (ii) a $34.3 million increase in U.K./Ireland resulting from the net impact of credits recorded during the second quarter
           of 2017 ($28.8 million), the fourth quarter of 2017 ($10.5 million) and the second quarter of 2018 ($5.0 million), primarily
                                                                                  II-23
           associated with a telecommunications operator’s agreement to compensate communications providers, including Virgin
           Media, for certain contractual breaches related to network charges, and (iii) higher interconnect and roaming costs,
           primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland and Switzerland. The lower MVNO costs in Belgium are primarily attributable
           to the impact of the migration of mobile subscribers from Telenet’s MVNO arrangement to Telenet’s mobile network,
           which was completed during the first quarter of 2018. For additional information, see note 15 to our consolidated financial
           statements; and

     •     A decrease of $7.3 million in the U.K. associated with the fourth quarter 2017 modification of a software agreement that
           resulted in the acquisition of a perpetual license and related conversion of the operating costs to capitalized costs.

  Other operating expenses

    Other operating expenses include network operations, customer operations, customer care, share-based compensation and
other costs related to our operations. We do not include share-based compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the
other operating expenses of our consolidated reportable segments as share-based compensation expense is not included in the
performance measures of our consolidated reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed below.

     Our other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased $53.7 million or 3.2% during 2018,
as compared to 2017. This increase includes an increase of $14.5 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions. On an organic
basis, our other operating expenses decreased $22.2 million or 1.3%. This decrease includes the following factors:

     •     An increase in network infrastructure charges in U.K./Ireland of $22.5 million following an increase in the rateable value
           of existing assets. For additional information, see “Other Regulatory Issues” in note 18 to our consolidated financial
           statements;

     •     A decrease in core network and information technology-related costs of $17.3 million or 5.2%, primarily due to the net
           effect of (i) a decrease in network maintenance and energy costs, primarily in Central and Corporate, U.K./Ireland and
           Belgium, (ii) an increase in outsourced data center costs, primarily in Central and Corporate, and (iii) a decrease in
           information technology-related expenses, primarily in Belgium;

     •     A decrease in business service costs of $12.7 million or 6.2%, primarily due to (i) decreased vehicle expenses due to the
           impact of the conversion of certain operating leases on company vehicles to capital leases, primarily in Belgium, (ii)
           lower energy costs, primarily in Belgium, and (iii) lower consulting costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland;


                                                                                  II-24
     •     An increase in personnel costs of $9.3 million or 2.0%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a higher average cost per
           employee, primarily due to an increase in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower staffing levels, as decreases in U.K./Ireland and Belgium
           were only partially offset by an increase in Central and Corporate, and (iii) higher incentive compensation costs, primarily
           in U.K./Ireland. A portion of the lower staffing levels in Belgium is attributable to the transfer of certain employees to a
           newly-formed joint venture that provides network maintenance and customer-facing services to Telenet. Effective with
           the July 1, 2018 formation of this non-consolidated joint venture, the costs associated with these services are included
           within our core network and outsourced labor operating expense categories;

     •     A decrease in customer service costs of $5.3 million or 2.0%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower call center costs,
           primarily in Belgium, U.K./Ireland and Switzerland, and (ii) an increase in customer premises equipment refurbishment,
           inventory management and other supply chain costs, as increases in Central and Corporate and Belgium were only partially
           offset by a decrease in U.K./Ireland;

     •     A decrease in encryption costs of $4.6 million in the U.K. associated with the 2018 modification of a service agreement
           that resulted in the acquisition of a time-based license and related conversion of the operating costs to capitalized costs;
           and

     •     An increase in outsourced labor costs of $4.4 million or 3.7%, primarily associated with customer-facing activities. This
           increase is largely attributable to the aforementioned July 1, 2018 formation of a non-consolidated joint venture in Belgium.

(a)       General and administrative expenses include all personnel-related costs within our SG&A expenses, including personnel-
          related costs associated with our sales and marketing function.

    Our SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased $19.5 million or 1.1% during 2018, as
compared to 2017. This increase includes an increase of $14.0 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions. On an organic
basis, our SG&A expenses decreased $61.3 million or 3.3%. This decrease includes the following factors:

      •     A decrease in external sales and marketing costs of $58.5 million or 14.7%, primarily due to lower costs associated with
            advertising campaigns in U.K./Ireland and Belgium;

      •     A decrease in personnel costs of $22.4 million or 2.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a lower average cost per
            employee, primarily due to decreases in Switzerland, Central and Corporate and Poland that were only partially offset
            by an increase in U.K./Ireland, (ii) lower incentive compensation costs of $9.6 million, primarily in Central and Corporate
            and U.K./Ireland, (iii) a decrease in temporary personnel costs, primarily in Central and Corporate and Belgium, and (iv)
            higher staffing levels, as increases in Switzerland and Poland were only partially offset by a decrease in U.K./Ireland.
            The lower incentive compensation costs are attributable to the expected settlement of a portion of our annual incentive
            compensation with Liberty Global ordinary shares through a shareholding incentive program that was implemented in
            the fourth quarter of 2017. This shareholding incentive program resulted in lower incentive compensation expense of
            $29.1 million during 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily in Central and Corporate. For additional information, see note
            14 to our consolidated financial statements;

      •     An increase in core network and information technology-related costs of $20.3 million or 11.8%, primarily due to higher
            information technology-related expenses in Central and Corporate and U.K./Ireland; and

      •     A decrease in business service and certain other costs of $14.3 million or 6.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower

  Share-based compensation expense (included in other operating and SG&A expenses)

   Our share-based compensation expense primarily relates to the share-based incentive awards issued by Liberty Global to its
employees and employees of its subsidiaries. A summary of our aggregate share-based compensation expense is set forth below:
                                                                                                                                                             Year ended December 31,

(a)      Includes share-based compensation expense related to PSUs, and, through March 2017, the PGUs held by our Chief
         Executive Officer.

(b)      Represents annual incentive compensation and defined contribution plan liabilities that have been or are expected to be
         settled with Liberty Global ordinary shares. In the case of the annual incentive compensation, shares will be issued to senior
         management and key employees pursuant to a shareholding incentive program that was implemented in the fourth quarter
         of 2017. The shareholding incentive program allows these employees to elect to receive up to 100% of their annual incentive
         compensation in ordinary shares of Liberty Global in lieu of cash.

(c)      Represents the share-based compensation expense associated with Telenet’s share-based incentive awards, which, at
         December 31, 2018, included performance- and non-performance-based stock option awards with respect to 4,494,002
         Telenet shares. These stock option awards had a weighted average exercise price of €42.50 ($48.67).

      For additional information concerning our share-based compensation, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Depreciation and amortization expense

     Our depreciation and amortization expense was $3,858.2 million and $3,790.6 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $69.2 million or 1.8% during 2018, as compared
to 2017. This decrease is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated,
primarily in U.K./Ireland, Central and Corporate, Belgium and, to a lesser extent Switzerland, (ii) an increase associated with
property and equipment additions related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the expansion and upgrade of our
networks and other capital initiatives.

  Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net

     We recognized impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, of $248.2 million during 2018, as compared to $79.9
million during 2017.

    The 2018 amount primarily includes (i) restructuring charges of $96.4 million, including (a) $42.2 million of employee
severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Central and Corporate,
and (b) $40.5 million in Belgium related to the migration of Telenet’s mobile subscribers from an MVNO arrangement to Telenet’s
mobile network, and (ii) a provision for litigation of $83.1 million related to a VAT matter in the U.K. recorded during the third
quarter of 2018. For additional information regarding Telenet’s exit from its MVNO arrangement, see note 15 to our consolidated
                                                                                            II-27
financial statements.

    The 2017 amount primarily includes (i) restructuring charges of $48.4 million, including $35.2 million of employee severance
and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Central and Corporate, and (ii) a
$40.0 million legal settlement recorded during the third quarter of 2017.

     If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive,
regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude
in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent,
other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

    For additional information regarding our restructuring charges, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. For
additional information regarding our impairments, see Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates — Impairment of
Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets below.

  Interest expense

     We recognized interest expense of $1,478.7 million and $1,416.1 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the
effects of FX, interest expense increased $11.3 million or 0.8% during 2018, as compared to 2017. This increase is primarily
attributable to slightly higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by lower average outstanding debt balances. For
additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

     It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing
indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note 8 to our
consolidated financial statements and under Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk below, we use derivative
instruments to manage our interest rate risks.

  Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net

      Our realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments include (i) unrealized changes in the fair values of our
derivative instruments that are non-cash in nature until such time as the derivative contracts are fully or partially settled and (ii)

(a)      The gain during 2018 is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a net gain associated with changes in the relative value
         of certain currencies and (ii) a net loss associated with changes in certain market interest rates. In addition, the gain during
         2018 includes a net loss of $71.1 million resulting from changes in our credit risk valuation adjustments. The loss during
         2017 is primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) a net loss associated with changes in the relative value of certain
         currencies and (b) a net gain associated with changes in certain market interest rates. In addition, the loss during 2017
         includes a net gain of $168.4 million resulting from changes in our credit risk valuation adjustments.

that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity. Unrealized foreign
currency transaction gains or losses are computed based on period-end exchange rates and are non-cash in nature until such time
as the amounts are settled. The details of our foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net, are as follows:

  Losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net

    We recognized net losses on debt modification and extinguishment of $65.0 million and $252.2 million during 2018 and 2017,
respectively.

      The loss during 2018 is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) the payment of $49.5 million of redemption premiums,
(ii) the write-off of $28.2 million of net unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts and (iii) a gain associated with the
settlement of the final tranche of the Sumitomo Collar, as described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

     The loss during 2017 is primarily attributable to (i) the payment of $138.4 million of redemption premiums and (ii) the write-
off of $115.4 million of net unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums.

       (1) Amounts have been presented on a pro forma basis that gives effect to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 as if such adoption
           had occurred on January 1, 2017.

       (2) Includes depreciation and amortization of $1,833.6 million and $1,678.5 million, respectively.

       (3) Includes interest expense of $678.3 million and $650.1 million, respectively.

     The VodafoneZiggo JV is experiencing significant competition. In particular, the mobile operations of the VodafoneZiggo
JV continue to experience competitive pressure on pricing, characterized by aggressive promotion campaigns, heavy marketing
efforts and increasing or unlimited data bundles. In light of this competition, as well as regulatory and economic factors, we could
conclude in future periods that our investment in the VodafoneZiggo JV is impaired or management of the VodafoneZiggo JV
could conclude that an impairment of the VodafoneZiggo JV goodwill and, to a lesser extent, long-lived assets, is required. Any
such impairment of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s goodwill or our investment in the VodafoneZiggo JV would be reflected as a component
of share of results of affiliates, net, in our consolidated statement of operations. Our share of any such impairment charges could
be significant.

    For additional information regarding our equity method investments, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Gain on VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction

     In connection with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain during 2016 of $520.8 million. In
connection with the finalization of the equalization payment from Vodafone associated with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction,
we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2017. For additional information, see note
6 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Other income, net

     We recognized other income, net, of $43.4 million and $46.4 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts
include (i) credits related to the non-service components of our net periodic pension cost of $18.1 million and $18.2 million,
respectively, and (ii) interest and dividend income of $13.4 million and $30.9 million, respectively. In addition, other income, net,
for 2018 includes a $12.3 million gain related to the formation of a joint venture in Belgium, representing the excess of the fair
value of our ownership interest in the joint venture over the carrying value of the assets that we contributed.

  Income tax benefit (expense)

    We recognized income tax expense of $1,573.3 million and $238.9 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively.

     The income tax expense during 2018 differs from the expected income tax expense of $30.7 million (based on the U.K.
statutory income tax rate of 19.00%), primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) the Mandatory Repatriation Tax, (ii) certain
permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries
and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items. The net

                                                                                        II-31
negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency
exchange results.

      The income tax expense during 2017 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $406.4 million (based on the blended
U.K. statutory income tax rate of 19.25%) primarily due to the net net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances,
(ii) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial
and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. The net negative impact of these
items was partially offset by the net positive impact of statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are
different than the U.K. statutory income tax rate.

    For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Loss from continuing operations

     During 2018 and 2017, we reported losses from continuing operations of $1,411.5 million and $2,350.0 million, respectively,
consisting of (i) operating income of $839.1 million and $792.4 million, respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of $677.3
million and $2,903.5 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax expense of $1,573.3 million and $238.9 million, respectively.

     Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in foreign currency
exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such,
any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from
these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings is largely dependent on our ability to increase our
aggregate Adjusted OIBDA to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) share-based compensation expense,
(b) depreciation and amortization, (c) impairment, restructuring and other operating items, (d) interest expense, (e) other non-
operating expenses and (f) income tax expenses.

     Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under
Material Changes in Financial Condition — Capitalization below, we expect that we will continue to report significant levels of
interest expense for the foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect
certain aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under Overview above. For information concerning
the reasons for changes in specific line items in our consolidated statements of operations, see Discussion and Analysis of our
Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results above.

  Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes

    Our earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $1,163.4 million and ($370.6 million) during 2018 and
2017, respectively, relates to the operations of UPC Austria, the Vodafone Disposal Group, UPC DTH and, for 2017, the LiLAC
Group. In addition, we recognized a gain on the sale of UPC Austria of $1,098.1 million during the third quarter of 2018. For
additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

    Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the noncontrolling interests’ share of the results of our continuing
and discontinued operations. Our net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $124.7 million and $57.5 million during
2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to improvements in the results of operations of Telenet and the
impact of the Split-off Transaction.

_________________

(a)     Residential cable subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential cable
        non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, channel carriage fees, installation revenue, late fees and revenue
        from the sale of equipment.

(b)     Residential subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(c)     Residential mobile subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential
        mobile non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, interconnect revenue and revenue from sales of mobile
        handsets and other devices. Residential mobile interconnect revenue was $253.0 million and $262.2 million during 2017
        and 2016, respectively.

(d)     B2B subscription revenue represents revenue from SOHO subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive
        expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or
        similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. A portion of the increases in our B2B subscription
        revenue is attributable to the conversion of certain residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers. B2B non-subscription
        revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony, mobile and data services offered
        to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators.


                                                                                 II-33
(e)      Other revenue includes, among other items, revenue earned from services provided to the VodafoneZiggo JV.

     Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue decreased $2,454.7 million or 17.9% during 2017, as compared to 2016. This decrease
includes (i) a decrease of $2,557.8 million attributable to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, (ii) an increase of
$146.6 million attributable to the impact of the BASE Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (iii) a decrease of
$33.0 million attributable to the impact of dispositions. On an organic basis, our consolidated revenue increased $214.1 million
or 1.9%.

     Residential revenue. The details of the change in our consolidated residential revenue for 2017, as compared to 2016, are as
follows (in millions):

     Total decrease in residential revenue ................................................................................................................ $                  (2,478.7)

     On an organic basis, our consolidated residential cable subscription revenue increased $30.4 million or 0.4% during 2017, as
compared to 2016. This increase is attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase from broadband internet services of $168.5
million or 5.9%, attributable to higher ARPU and an increase in the average number of RGUs, (ii) a decrease from video services
of $88.0 million or 3.0%, attributable to a decrease in the average number of RGUs and lower ARPU, and (iii) a decrease from
fixed-line telephony services of $50.1 million or 2.9%, attributable to the net effect of lower ARPU and an increase in the average
number of RGUs.

    On an organic basis, our consolidated residential cable non-subscription revenue increased $76.8 million or 29.0% during
2017, as compared to 2016. This increase is primarily due to increases in the U.K., Switzerland and Belgium.

     On an organic basis, our consolidated residential mobile subscription revenue decreased $68.3 million or 6.3% during 2017,
as compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily due to the net effect of (i) declines in the U.K. and Belgium and (ii) an increase
in Switzerland.

    On an organic basis, our consolidated residential mobile non-subscription revenue increased $11.7 million or 1.9% during
2017, as compared to 2016. This increase is primarily due to increases in the U.K. and Ireland that were only partially offset by
a decrease in Belgium.

     B2B revenue. On an organic basis, our consolidated B2B subscription revenue increased $91.0 million or 33.5% during 2017,
as compared to 2016. This increase is primarily due to increases in SOHO revenue in Belgium and the U.K.

     On an organic basis, our consolidated B2B non-subscription revenue increased $62.4 million or 4.6% during 2017, as compared
to 2016. This increase is primarily due to increases in Belgium, Switzerland, the U.K. and Poland.

our Reportable Segments above.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     Our programming and other direct costs of services decreased $525.8 million or 15.0% during 2017, as compared to 2016.
This decrease includes (i) a decrease of $522.7 million attributable to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, (ii) an
increase of $51.1 million attributable to the impact of the BASE Acquisition and other less significant acquisitions and (iii) a
decrease of $18.3 million attributable to the impact of dispositions. On an organic basis, our programming and other direct costs
of services increased $27.9 million or 0.9%. This increase includes the following factors:

    •     An increase in programming and copyright costs of $65.8 million or 4.4%, primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland
          and Switzerland. This increase is primarily due to (i) higher costs for certain premium and/or basic content, including
          higher costs for sports rights, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Switzerland, and (ii) growth in the number of enhanced video
          subscribers, primarily due to increases in U.K./Ireland and Poland that were only partially offset by a decrease in Belgium.
          The cost for sports rights increased by $28.9 million in Switzerland due to the acquisition of the rights to carry live
          sporting events in connection with the September 2017 launch of our Swiss sports channels;

    •     A decrease in interconnect and access costs of $65.3 million or 7.2%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a $42.1 million
          decrease (including $32.3 million and $9.8 million recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively) in
          U.K./Ireland, in connection with a telecommunications operator’s agreement to compensate communications providers,
          including Virgin Media, for certain contractual breaches related to network charges, (ii) lower MVNO costs, as decreases
          in Belgium and U.K./Ireland were only partially offset by an increase in Switzerland, (iii) lower fixed-line telephony call
          volumes due to declines in U.K./Ireland and Switzerland and (iv) an increase of $6.8 million due to the release of an
          accrual during the second quarter of 2016 related to the settlement of an operational contingency in Belgium; and

    •     An increase in mobile handset and other device costs of $30.5 million or 9.3%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a
          higher average cost per handset sold in U.K./Ireland and (ii) lower mobile handset and other device sales volumes,
          primarily due to decreases in Belgium and U.K./Ireland that were only partially offset by an increase in Central and
          Corporate.

N.M. — Not Meaningful.

     Our other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased $266.6 million or 13.9% during
2017, as compared to 2016. This decrease includes (i) a decrease of $327.6 million attributable to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo
JV Transaction and (ii) an increase of $23.0 million attributable to the impact of the BASE Acquisition and other less significant
acquisitions. On an organic growth basis, our other operating expenses increased $64.0 million or 4.0%. This increase includes
the following factors:

     •     An increase in network infrastructure charges in U.K./Ireland of $34.0 million following an increase in the rateable value
           of existing assets. For additional information, see “Other Regulatory Issues” in note 18 to our consolidated financial
           statements;

     •     A decrease in personnel costs of $16.3 million or 3.1%, due primarily to the net effect of (i) lower staffing levels, as
           decreases in Central and Corporate and U.K./Ireland were only partially offset by an increase in Belgium, (ii) decreased
           costs in U.K./Ireland and Belgium resulting from higher capitalized labor costs, (iii) annual wage increases, (iv) lower
           incentive compensation costs, primarily in U.K./Ireland, and (v) higher costs related to certain employee benefits in
           Belgium and Central and Corporate. The higher capitalized labor costs in U.K./Ireland are associated with (a) the Network
           Extensions and (b) increased installations of new customer premises equipment. The higher capitalized labor costs in
           Belgium are primarily associated with a project to upgrade Telenet’s mobile network;

     •     An increase in outsourced labor costs of $14.6 million or 11.4% primarily associated with customer-facing activities in
           U.K./Ireland;

     •     A decrease in vehicle expenses of $7.8 million or 43.2%, a portion of which is due to the impact of the conversion of
           certain operating leases on company vehicles to capital leases, primarily in U.K./Ireland; and

     •     An increase in core network and information technology-related expenses of $7.4 million or 1.6%, primarily due to the
           net effect of (i) an increase in network maintenance and energy costs, primarily due to increases in Central and Corporate
           and Switzerland that were only partially offset by a decrease in U.K./Ireland, (ii) a $5.9 million increase in U.K./Ireland
           associated with the impact of the settlement of an operational contingency during the first quarter of 2016 and (iii) a
           decrease in information technology-related expenses, primarily due to a decrease in U.K./Ireland that was only partially
           offset by an increase in Central and Corporate.

     Our SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased $407.0 million or 18.3% during 2017, as
compared to 2016. This decrease includes (i) a decrease of $368.0 million attributable to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV
Transaction and (ii) an increase of $32.4 million attributable to the impact of the BASE Acquisition and other less significant
acquisitions. On an organic basis, our SG&A expenses decreased $44.1 million or 2.3%. This decrease includes the following
factors:

      •     A decrease in personnel costs of $45.8 million or 5.5% due primarily to the net effect of (i) decreased staffing levels,
            primarily due to decreases in Central and Corporate and Belgium, (ii) lower incentive compensation costs, primarily due
            to decreases in Central and Corporate and U.K./Ireland that were only partially offset by increases in Belgium and
            Switzerland, and (iii) annual wage increases. The lower incentive compensation costs include a decrease of $12.5 million,
            primarily in Central and Corporate, attributable to the then expected settlement of a portion of our annual incentive
            compensation with Liberty Global ordinary shares through a shareholding incentive program that was implemented in
            the fourth quarter of 2017;

      •     A decrease in business service costs of $42.2 million or 25.6%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in consulting
            costs, primarily Central and Corporate and Belgium, and (ii) lower audit and legal fees. The decrease in consulting costs
                                                                   II-37
            in Belgium includes an aggregate decrease of $6.3 million related to costs incurred during 2016 associated with the
            integration of BASE with our operations in Belgium;

      •     An increase in core network and information technology-related expenses of $17.1 million or 16.8%, primarily due to
            an increase in information technology-related expenses in U.K./Ireland;

      •     An increase in external sales and marketing costs of $9.0 million or 1.9%, primarily due to (i) higher third-party sales
            commissions, primarily due to an increase in U.K./Ireland and (ii) higher costs associated with advertising campaigns,
            primarily due to an increase in Switzerland; and

      •     An increase in customer service costs of $7.8 million or 26.7%, primarily due to higher call center costs in U.K./Ireland.

  Depreciation and amortization expense

     Our depreciation and amortization expense was $3,790.6 million and $4,117.7 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $252.9 million or 6.1% during 2017, as compared
to 2016. This decrease is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease associated with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, (ii)
an increase associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the
expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives, (iii) a decrease associated with certain assets becoming fully
depreciated, primarily in U.K./Ireland, Central and Corporate, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent Belgium, and (iv) an increase
due to accelerated depreciation, primarily in U.K./Ireland.

  Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net

      We recognized impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, of $79.9 million during 2017, as compared to $124.5

                                                                                            II-38
million during 2016.

    The 2017 amount primarily includes (i) restructuring charges of $48.4 million, including $35.2 million of employee severance
and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland and Central and Corporate, and (ii) a
$40.0 million legal settlement recorded during the third quarter of 2017.

     The 2016 amount primarily includes (i) restructuring charges of $90.2 million, including (a) $62.8 million of employee
severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland, Central and Corporate and
the Netherlands, and (b) contract termination charges of $24.2 million, primarily in Central and Corporate, and (ii) direct acquisition
costs of $45.3 million, primarily related to the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction and the BASE Acquisition.

   For information regarding our acquisitions, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding the
VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

      For additional information regarding our restructuring charges, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Interest expense

     We recognized interest expense of $1,416.1 million and $1,866.1 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the
effects of FX, interest expense decreased $422.0 million or 22.6% during 2017, as compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily
attributable to (i) lower average outstanding debt balances, largely due to a decrease related to the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction
and (ii) lower weighted average interest rates related to the completion of certain financing transactions that resulted in extended
maturities and decreases to certain of our interest rates. For additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see
note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net

    We recognized net losses on debt modification and extinguishment of $252.2 million and $233.8 million during 2017 and
2016, respectively.

     The loss during 2017 is primarily attributable to (i) the payment of $138.4 million of redemption premiums and (ii) the write-
off of $115.4 million of net unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums.

     The loss during 2016 is primarily attributable to (i) the payment of $128.8 million of redemption premiums and (ii) the write-
off of $95.4 million of net unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums.

_______________

(a)      Amount in 2017 includes the net effect of (i) $64.3 million, representing 100% of the interest income earned on the
         VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable, (ii) 100% of the share-based compensation expense associated with Liberty Global awards
         held by VodafoneZiggo JV employees who were formerly employees of Liberty Global, as these awards remain our
         responsibility, and (iii) our 50% share of the remaining results of operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV. During 2017, the
         VodafoneZiggo JV generated (a) revenue of $4,512.5 million, (b) Adjusted OIBDA of $1,910.6 million, (c) operating income
         of $217.6 million, (d) net non-operating expenses of $580.5 million (including $650.1 million of interest expense) and (e)
         a net loss of $259.3 million. The VodafoneZiggo JV’s operating income includes depreciation and amortization of $1,678.5
         million.

  Gain on VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction

     In connection with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain during 2016 of $520.8 million, net of
the recognition of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $714.5 million. In connection with the finalization of the
equalization payment from Vodafone associated with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain
of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2017. For additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Other income, net

     We recognized other income, net, of $46.4 million and $124.0 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts
include (i) interest and dividend income of $30.9 million and $36.2 million, respectively, and (ii) credits related to the non-service
components of our net periodic pension cost of $18.2 million and $14.7 million, respectively. In addition, the 2016 amount includes
income of $69.8 million, representing our share of the settlement of certain litigation.

  Income tax benefit (expense)

      We recognized income tax benefit (expense) of ($238.9 million) and $1,407.0 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.

     The income tax expense during 2017 differs from the expected income tax benefit of $406.4 million (based on the blended
U.K. statutory income tax rate of 19.25%) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii)
non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and
tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. The net negative impact of these items
                                                                                            II-41
was partially offset by the net positive impact of statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different
than the U.K. statutory income tax rate.

     The income tax benefit during 2016 differs from the expected income tax expense of $48.7 million (based on the U.K. statutory
income tax rate of 20.0%) primarily due to the net positive impact of (i) a decrease in valuation allowances, including tax benefits
of $1.1 billion recognized in the Netherlands upon the release of valuation allowances in the fourth quarter of 2016, (ii) the
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, (iii) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results, (iv)
the tax effect of intercompany financing and (v) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different
than the U.K. statutory income tax rate. The release of valuation allowances in the Netherlands is attributable to a significant
improvement in our forecast of taxable income in the Netherlands, due to, among other factors, the impacts of contributing
VodafoneZiggo Holding to the VodafoneZiggo JV on December 31, 2016, as further described in note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements. The net positive impact of these items was partially offset by the net negative impact of a reduction in net
deferred tax assets in the U.K. and other countries due to enacted changes in tax law.

    For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Earnings (loss) from continuing operations

     During 2017 and 2016, we reported earnings (loss) from continuing operations of ($2,350.0 million) and $1,650.3 million,
respectively, consisting of (i) operating income of $792.4 million and $1,570.1 million, respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense
of $2,903.5 million and $1,326.8 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax benefit (expense) of ($238.9 million) and $1,407.0
million, respectively.

  Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes

     Our earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of ($370.6 million) and $117.0 million during 2017 and 2016
relates to the operations of UPC Austria, the Vodafone Disposal Group, UPC DTH and the LiLAC Group. For additional information,
see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

    Our net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $57.5 million and $62.0 million during 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to the net effect of an improvement in the results of operations of Telenet and
declines in the results of operations of Liberty Puerto Rico and certain C&W subsidiaries.




                                                                II-42
Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Sources and Uses of Cash

     We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements
at the corporate level. Each of our significant operating subsidiaries is separately financed within one of our three subsidiary
“borrowing groups.” These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within Virgin Media,
UPC Holding and Telenet. Although our borrowing groups typically generate cash from operating activities, the terms of the
instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowing groups may restrict our ability to access the liquidity of these
subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal
considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests and other factors.

  Cash and cash equivalents

     The details of the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 are
set forth in the following table (in millions):
Cash and cash equivalents held by:
 Liberty Global and unrestricted subsidiaries:

         Total cash and cash equivalents............................................................................................................... $                   1,480.5
_______________

(a)     Represents the amount held by Liberty Global on a standalone basis.

(b)     Represents the aggregate amount held by subsidiaries that are outside of our borrowing groups.

(c)     Except as otherwise noted, represents the aggregate amounts held by the parent entity and restricted subsidiaries of our
        borrowing groups.

(d)     The Virgin Media borrowing group includes certain subsidiaries of Virgin Media, but excludes the parent entity, Virgin
        Media Inc.

  Liquidity of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries

     The $10.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations,
the $1,333.2 million of aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by unrestricted subsidiaries, represented available liquidity at
the corporate level at December 31, 2018. Our remaining cash and cash equivalents of $136.5 million at December 31, 2018 were
held by our borrowing groups as set forth in the table above. As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the
cash of our borrowing groups. For information regarding certain limitations imposed by our subsidiaries’ debt instruments at
December 31, 2018, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

     Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain
tax and legal considerations, Liberty Global’s unrestricted subsidiaries, (ii) interest and dividend income received on our and,
subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries’ cash and cash equivalents and investments, including
dividends received from the VodafoneZiggo JV, (iii) principal and interest payments received with respect to the VodafoneZiggo
JV Receivable and (iv) cash received with respect to transitional services provided to the VodafoneZiggo JV, Deutsche Telekom
and Liberty Latin America.


                                                                                          II-43
     From time to time, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of distributions
or loan repayments from Liberty Global’s borrowing groups or affiliates (including amounts from the VodafoneZiggo JV) upon
(a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings, asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation
of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of Liberty Global
and its unrestricted subsidiaries and (iii) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt by Liberty Global or its unrestricted
subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by Liberty Global, including equity securities issued to satisfy subsidiary obligations.
No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries on
favorable terms, or at all. For information regarding the liquidity impacts of the disposition of UPC Austria and the pending
dispositions of the Vodafone Disposal Group and UPC DTH, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. For information
regarding the liquidity impact of the pending sale of our operations in Switzerland, see note 21 to our consolidated financial
statements.

     At December 31, 2018, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance included $1,455.1 million held by entities that
are domiciled outside of the U.K. Based on our assessment of our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient
basis, our expectations with respect to our corporate liquidity requirements and our preliminary assessment of the 2017 U.S. Tax
Act, we do not anticipate that tax considerations will adversely impact our corporate liquidity over the next 12 months. Our ability
to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis is a consideration in assessing the extent of our share repurchase
program.

     In addition, the amount of cash we receive from our subsidiaries to satisfy U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements is
impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly with regard to the translation of British pounds sterling and euros into
U.S. dollars. In this regard, the strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar against these currencies will result in decreases
(increases) in the U.S. dollars received from the applicable subsidiaries to fund the repurchase of our equity securities and other
U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements.

    Our corporate liquidity requirements include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses, (ii) interest payments on our
secured borrowing arrangement with respect to the ITV Collar Loan and (iii) principal payments on the ITV Collar Loan and our
secured borrowing arrangement with respect to the Lionsgate Loan to the extent not settled through the delivery of the underlying
shares. In addition, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may require cash in connection with (a) the repayment of third-
party and intercompany debt, (b) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (c) acquisitions, (d) the repurchase of equity and debt
securities, (e) other investment opportunities, (f) any funding requirements of our subsidiaries and affiliates or (g) income tax
payments. In addition, our parent entity uses available liquidity to make interest and principal payments on notes payable to certain
of our unrestricted subsidiaries (aggregate outstanding principal of $13.0 billion at December 31, 2018 with varying maturity
dates). For information regarding our commitments and contingencies, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.

     During 2018, the aggregate amount of our share repurchases was $2,010.0 million, including direct acquisition costs. In July
2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $500.0 million of share repurchases through July 2019. At December 31,
2018, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was $566.2 million. As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only
elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our Distributable Reserves. For additional information regarding our
share repurchase programs and Distributable Reserves, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Liquidity of borrowing groups

     The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents,
the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their
respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of our borrowing groups at December 31, 2018, see note
11 to our consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by
contributions and/or loans from Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries. The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally
is used to fund property and equipment additions, debt service requirements and income tax payments. From time to time, our
borrowing groups may also require liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to
Liberty Global, (iii) capital distributions to Liberty Global and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities.
No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. For
information regarding our borrowing groups’ commitments and contingencies, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.

    For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows below.




                                                                  II-44
  Capitalization

     We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard,
we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance
(excluding the ITV Collar Loan and Lionsgate Loan and measured using subsidiary debt figures at swapped foreign currency
exchange rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements) that is between four and
five times our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA, although the timing of our acquisitions and financing transactions and the interplay
of average and spot foreign currency rates may impact this ratio. The ratio of our December 31, 2018 consolidated debt to our
annualized consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was 5.0x. In addition, the ratio of our
December 31, 2018 consolidated net debt (debt, as defined above, less cash and cash equivalents) to our annualized consolidated
Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was 4.8x. Consistent with how we calculate our leverage ratios under
our debt agreements, these ratios are presented on a basis that includes the debt and Adjusted OIBDA of both our continuing and
discontinued operations.

     Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements
and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted OIBDA of our
operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our
ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the incurrence-based leverage covenants contained in the various debt
instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted OIBDA of one of our borrowing groups were to decline, our
ability to obtain additional debt could be limited. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources of liquidity,
or that any external funding would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such required repayment. At December 31,
2018, each of our borrowing groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of
non-compliance with respect to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our
liquidity during the next 12 months.

     At December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our capital lease obligations,
aggregated $29.9 billion, including $3.6 billion that is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet and $22.7 billion that
is not due until 2024 or thereafter. All of our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by
our subsidiaries at December 31, 2018. For additional information concerning our debt maturities, see note 11 to our consolidated
financial statements.

     Notwithstanding our negative working capital position at December 31, 2018, we believe that we have sufficient resources
to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements
during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance
or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions
or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign
debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our
future liquidity and financial position. Our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely impacted
by (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties, which could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities
and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) tightening of the credit
markets. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or
other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory
developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity.

     For additional information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note 11 to our consolidated financial
statements.

  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

   General. Our cash flows are subject to significant variations due to FX. See related discussion under Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk below.

      Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows — 2018 compared to 2017

      Summary. The 2018 and 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows of our continuing operations are summarized as follows:
                                                                                                                          Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                                           2018             2017           Change
                                                                                                                                         in millions


Net cash provided by operating activities ........................................................ $                         3,985.0 $        3,442.7 $         542.3
Net cash provided by investing activities.........................................................                             601.5            781.0          (179.5)
Net cash used by financing activities ...............................................................                       (6,286.6)        (4,504.2)       (1,782.4)
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted
 cash .................................................................................................................        (43.2)           114.2          (157.4)
   Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash..................... $                                     (1,743.3) $        (166.3) $     (1,577.0)

     Operating Activities. The increase in net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of
(i) an increase in cash provided by our Adjusted OIBDA and related working capital items, (ii) an increase in cash provided due
to higher cash receipts related to derivative instruments and (iii) a decrease in the reported net cash provided by operating activities
due to FX.

     Investing Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by our investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of
(i) an increase in cash provided of $2,058.2 million in connection with net proceeds received from the sale of UPC Austria, (ii) a
decrease in cash provided of $1,569.4 million related to distributions received from affiliates during 2017, (iii) a decrease in cash
provided of $845.3 million associated with the equalization payment received during 2017 in connection with the completion of
the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, (iv) an increase in cash provided of $331.4 million associated with lower cash paid in connection
with acquisitions and (v) a decrease in cash provided of $203.0 million due to higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures
increased from $1,250.0 million during 2017 to $1,453.0 million during 2018 due to the net effect of (a) an increase in our net
local currency capital expenditures and related working capital movements, including the impact of lower capital-related vendor
financing, (b) a decrease in proceeds received for transfers to related parties and (c) an increase resulting from FX.




                                                                                           II-46
     The capital expenditures that we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed
under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions
to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid.
In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude
amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements, and (ii) our total property and equipment
additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing
or capital lease arrangements. For further details regarding our property and equipment additions, see note 19 to our consolidated
financial statements. A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures,
as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, is set forth below:
                                                                                                                                               Year ended December 31,

 Proceeds received for transfers to related parties (a)..........................................................................                     (99.7)       (336.5)
  Total capital expenditures, net.......................................................................................................... $       1,453.0   $   1,250.0
_______________

(a)     Primarily relates to transfers of centrally-procured property and equipment to our discontinued operations and the
        VodafoneZiggo JV.

     The increase in our property and equipment additions during 2018 is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase due to
FX and (ii) a decrease in local currency expenditures of our subsidiaries, primarily due to the net effect of (a) a decrease in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects, (b) an increase in baseline expenditures, including network improvements and
expenditures for property and facilities and information technology systems, (c) an increase in expenditures for the purchase and
installation of customer premises equipment and (d) an increase in expenditures to support new customer products and operational
efficiency initiatives. During 2018 and 2017, our property and equipment additions represented 31.0% and 32.8% of revenue,
respectively.

     We expect our 2019 property and equipment additions to decline significantly as compared to our 2018 property and equipment
additions. The actual amount of our 2019 property and equipment additions may vary from our expectations for a variety of reasons,
including (i) changes in (a) the competitive or regulatory environment, (b) business plans, (c) our expected future operating results
or (d) foreign currency exchange rates and (ii) the availability of sufficient capital. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that
our actual property and equipment additions will not vary materially from our expectations.

      Financing Activities. The increase in net cash used by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i)
an increase in cash used of $2,812.0 million related to higher net repayments and repurchases of debt and capital lease obligations,
(ii) a decrease in cash used of $966.3 million due to lower repurchases of Liberty Global ordinary shares, (iii) an increase in cash
used of $277.3 million related to higher distributions by subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests and (iv) a decrease in cash used
of $250.9 million due to higher cash receipts related to derivative instruments.

     Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect
of (i) a decrease in the cash provided by our Adjusted OIBDA and related working capital items, including a decrease due to the
impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, (ii) an increase in cash provided due to lower payments of interest, including lower
payments due to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, and (iii) an increase in cash provided due to higher cash dividends
received, primarily from the VodafoneZiggo JV.

     Investing Activities. The change in net cash provided (used) by our investing activities is primarily attributable to increases
in cash of (i) $3,150.1 million due to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash contributed to the VodafoneZiggo JV in
connection with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction during 2016, (ii) $1,569.4 million related to distributions received from affiliates
during 2017, (iii) $979.5 million associated with lower cash paid in connection with acquisitions, (iv) $845.3 million associated
with the equalization payment received during 2017 in connection with the completion of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction and
(v) $293.7 million due to lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased from $1,539.9 million during 2016 to $1,250.0
million during 2017 due to the net effect of (a) a decrease due to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, (b) an increase
in proceeds received for transfers to related parties and (c) a decrease in our net local currency capital expenditures and related
working capital movements, including the impact of higher capital-related vendor financing.

     A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures as reported
in our consolidated statements of cash flows is set forth below:
                                                                                                                                               Year ended December 31,

(a)      Primarily relates to transfers of centrally-procured property and equipment to our discontinued operations and the
         VodafoneZiggo JV.

    The increase in the our property and equipment additions during 2017 is due to the net effect of (i) an increase in local currency
expenditures of our subsidiaries, primarily due to the net effect of (a) a decrease due to the impact of the VodafoneZiggo JV

                                                                                           II-48
Transaction, (b) an increase in expenditures to support new customer products and operational efficiency initiatives, (c) an increase
in expenditures for new build and upgrade products, (d) an increase in expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer
premises equipment and (e) a decrease in baseline expenditures, including network improvements and expenditures for property
and facilities and information technology systems and (ii) a decrease due to FX. During 2017 and 2016, our property and equipment
additions represented 32.8% and 27.2% of revenue, respectively.

     Financing Activities. The change in net cash provided (used) by our financing activities is primarily attributable to decreases
in cash of (i) $4,812.3 million associated with lower net borrowings of debt and (ii) $1,007.9 million due to higher cash payments
associated with the repurchase of Liberty Global ordinary shares.

  Adjusted Free Cash Flow

     We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by the operating activities of our continuing operations, plus (i) cash
payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions and (ii) expenses
financed by an intermediary, less (a) capital expenditures, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, (b) principal
payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and (c) principal payments on capital leases (exclusive of the portions
of the network lease in Belgium and the duct leases in Germany that we assumed in connection with an acquisition), with each
item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. We believe that our presentation of adjusted free cash
flow provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund
new investment opportunities. Adjusted free cash flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary
amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at
this amount. Investors should view adjusted free cash flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of
liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

(a)     Amounts include interest payments related to debt that has been or may be repaid in connection with the completion of the
        dispositions of UPC Austria, the Vodafone Disposal Group and UPC DTH. These interest payments have not been allocated
        to discontinued operations.

(b)     For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, expenses financed by an intermediary are treated as hypothetical
        operating cash outflows and hypothetical financing cash inflows when the expenses are incurred. When we pay the financing
        intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our adjusted
        free cash flow definition, we add back the hypothetical operating cash outflow when these financed expenses are incurred
        and deduct the financing cash outflows when we pay the financing intermediary.

_______________

(a)     The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our December 31, 2018 consolidated
        balance sheet other than debt and capital lease obligations. Our liability for uncertain tax positions in the various jurisdictions
        in which we operate ($637.3 million at December 31, 2018) has been excluded from the table as the amount and timing of
        any related payments are not subject to reasonable estimation.

(b)     Amounts are based on interest rates, interest payment dates, commitment fees and contractual maturities in effect as of
        December 31, 2018. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from the actual cash
        payments required in future periods. In addition, the amounts presented do not include the impact of our interest rate
        derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts.

     For information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. For
information concerning our commitments, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.

     In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments
and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For
information regarding projected cash flows associated with these derivative instruments, see Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk — Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivative Instruments below. For information regarding
our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during 2018, 2017 and
2016, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. For information concerning our defined benefit plans, see note 16 to
our consolidated financial statements.




                                                                       II-50
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

     In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties,
which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following
accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to
account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change:

    •    Impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill);
    •    Costs associated with construction and installation activities;
    •    Fair value measurements; and
    •    Income tax accounting.
     We have discussed the selection of the aforementioned critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of
directors. For additional information concerning our significant accounting policies, see note 3 to our consolidated financial
statements.

  Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

    Carrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill) that
was held for use comprised 67.2% of the total assets of our continuing operations at December 31, 2018.

     When circumstances warrant, we review the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets (other
than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse
changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which
we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see
below). If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying
value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar
assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets
to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

     We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1 and whenever
facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to
both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value
is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. Any excess
of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. A reporting unit is an operating
segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). With respect to other indefinite-lived intangible
assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then
estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.

     When required, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of reporting units and underlying
long-lived and indefinite-lived assets. The equity of one of our reporting units, Telenet, is publicly traded in an active market. For
this reporting unit, our fair value determination is based on quoted market prices. For other reporting units, we typically determine
fair value using an income-based approach (discounted cash flows) based on assumptions in our long-range business plans and,
in some cases, a combination of an income-based approach and a market-based approach. With respect to our discounted cash
flow analysis used in the income-based approach, the timing and amount of future cash flows under these business plans require
estimates of, among other items, subscriber growth and retention rates, rates charged per product, expected gross margins and
Adjusted OIBDA margins and expected property and equipment additions. The development of these cash flows, and the discount
rate applied to the cash flows, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
Our determination of the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital approach, which uses a market participant’s
cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. Based on the results of our 2018 qualitative
assessment of our reporting unit carrying values, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that fair value exceeded carrying
value for all of our reporting units.
                                                                   II-51
    During the three years ended December 31, 2018, we did not record any significant impairment charges with respect to our
property and equipment and intangible assets. For additional information regarding our long-lived assets, see note 10 to our
consolidated financial statements.

     If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive,
regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude
in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent,
other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

  Costs Associated with Construction and Installation Activities

     We capitalize costs associated with the construction of new cable and mobile transmission and distribution facilities and the
installation of new cable services. Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection (or drop) from our
cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of equipment for additional services,
such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-facing activities, such as reconnecting
customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed
as incurred.

     The nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves
significant judgment. In addition to direct external and internal labor and materials, we also capitalize other costs directly attributable
to our construction and installation activities, including dispatch costs, quality-control costs, vehicle-related costs and certain
warehouse-related costs. The capitalization of these costs is based on time sheets, time studies, standard costs, call tracking systems
and other verifiable means that directly link the costs incurred with the applicable capitalizable activity. We continuously monitor
the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and update the policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and
circumstances, such as the development of new products and services and changes in the manner that installations or construction
activities are performed.

  Fair Value Measurements

     U.S. GAAP provides guidance with respect to the recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements and for a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are
quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the
measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

     Recurring Valuations. We perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to our derivative instruments, our fair value
method investments and certain instruments that we classify as debt, each of which are carried at fair value. We use (i) cash flow
valuation models to determine the fair values of our interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and (ii) a Black
Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair values of our equity-related derivative instruments. We use quoted market
prices when available and, when not available, we use a combination of an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market
approach (market multiples of similar businesses) to determine the fair value of our fair value method investments. For a detailed
discussion of the inputs we use to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments and fair value method investments, see
note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. See also notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for information
concerning our fair value method investments and derivative instruments, respectively.

     Changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments, fair value method investments and certain instruments that we classify
as debt have had, and we believe will continue to have, a significant and volatile impact on our results of operations. During 2018,
2017 and 2016, we recognized net gains (losses) of $741.3 million, ($1,009.4 million) and $583.4 million, respectively, attributable
to changes in the fair values of these items.

     As further described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, actual amounts received or paid upon the settlement
or disposition of these investments and instruments may differ materially from the recorded fair values at December 31, 2018.

    For information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes
in market conditions, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Sensitivity Information below.

    Nonrecurring Valuations. Our nonrecurring valuations are primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition
accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable
valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts,
                                                               II-52
including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-
lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from
acquired net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage
third-party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization,
impairment charges and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we
believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded
through the application of acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to impairment assessments. For
additional information, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding our acquisitions and long-
lived assets, see notes 5 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements, respectively.

  Income Tax Accounting

     We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income
tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted
tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. This process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the
ultimate tax impact of such items.

     Net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if we believe it more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Establishing or reducing a tax valuation allowance requires us to make assessments about the timing of future
events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2018,
the aggregate valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets was $4,094.7 million. The actual amount of deferred income
tax benefits realized in future periods will likely differ from the net deferred tax assets reflected in our December 31, 2018
consolidated balance sheet due to, among other factors, possible future changes in income tax law or interpretations thereof in the
jurisdictions in which we operate and differences between estimated and actual future taxable income. Any such factors could
have a material effect on our current and deferred tax positions as reported in our consolidated financial statements. A high degree
of judgment is required to assess the impact of possible future outcomes on our current and deferred tax positions.

     Tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have a presence are subject to varied interpretation, and many tax positions we take are
subject to significant uncertainty regarding whether the position will be ultimately sustained after review by the relevant tax
authority. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits,
that the position will be sustained upon examination. The determination of whether the tax position meets the more-likely-than-
not threshold requires a facts-based judgment using all information available. In a number of cases, we have concluded that the
more-likely-than-not threshold is not met and, accordingly, the amount of tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial
statements is different than the amount taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits for financial reporting purposes, but taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns, was $857.8 million,
of which $759.8 million would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering
amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances.

     We are required to continually assess our tax positions, and the results of tax examinations or changes in judgment can result
in substantial changes to our unrecognized tax benefits.




                                                                 II-53
Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various foreign
countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse
changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and
processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

  Cash and Investments

     We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk
to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources
of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of our and our subsidiaries’ short-term liquidity requirements. In order to
mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in light of our and our subsidiaries’ forecasted
liquidity requirements. At December 31, 2018, $670.2 million or 45.3%, $646.0 million or 43.6% and $151.3 million or 10.2%
of our consolidated cash balances were denominated in euros, U.S. dollars and British pounds sterling, respectively.

     We are exposed to market price fluctuations related to our investments in ITV and Lionsgate shares. At December 31, 2018,
the aggregate fair value of these investments was $634.2 million and $77.5 million, respectively. All of our ITV shares are held
through the ITV Collar, and 50% of our Lionsgate shares are held through the Lionsgate Forward. For information concerning
the terms of (i) the ITV Collar and ITV Collar Loan and (ii) the Lionsgate Forward and Lionsgate Loan, see note 8 to our consolidated
financial statements. For those shares that are held through the ITV Collar and the Lionsgate Forward, our exposure to market
risk is limited. For additional information concerning our investments in ITV and Lionsgate shares, see note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements.

  Foreign Currency Risk

     We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or
refinance such debt. Although we generally match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional
currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter
into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt).
In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative
instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2018, substantially
all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations.
For additional information concerning the terms of our derivative instruments, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

     In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are
exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts,
notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in
our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, we will consider
hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or
receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or
receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge certain of these risks. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note
8 to our consolidated financial statements.

     We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against
the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign
currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency
translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a
negative impact on our comprehensive earnings or loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of FX. Our primary
exposure to FX risk during the three months ended December 31, 2018 was to the British pound sterling and euro as 52.9% and
                                                                 II-54
32.4% of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the British pound
sterling and euro, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the
Swiss franc and other local currencies in Europe. We do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the
translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. For information regarding certain currency
instability risks with respect to the British pound sterling and euro, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Overview above.

    The relationships between the primary currencies of the countries in which we operate and the U.S. dollar, which is our
reporting currency, are shown below, per one U.S. dollar:

  Inflation and Foreign Investment Risk

    We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to labor, programming and other costs. While we attempt to increase our
revenue to offset increases in costs, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Therefore, costs could rise faster than
associated revenue, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. The economic
environment in the respective countries in which we operate is a function of government, economic, fiscal and monetary policies
and various other factors beyond our control that could lead to inflation. We are unable to predict the extent that price levels might
be impacted in future periods by the current state of the economies in the countries in which we operate.

  Interest Rate Risks

     We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed-rate and
variable-rate borrowings by our borrowing groups. Our primary exposure to variable-rate debt is through the EURIBOR-indexed
and LIBOR-indexed debt of our borrowing groups and the variable-rate debt of certain of our other subsidiaries.

    In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate
debt. For additional information concerning the impacts of these interest rate derivative instruments, see note 8 to our consolidated
financial statements.

   In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop
compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact transitional
                                                                                              II-55
arrangements for calculating applicable reference rates that may be made in the U.K., the U.S., the Eurozone or elsewhere given
that a number of outcomes are possible, including the cessation of the publication of one or more reference rates. Our loan documents
contain provisions that contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate applicable to our LIBOR-indexed debt to the extent
LIBOR is not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what would have
been calculated under LIBOR. Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our
loan documents in the event that the LIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies
to our LIBOR-indexed debt could be different than any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed derivative instruments.
We anticipate managing this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/
or derivative instruments, however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications
and/or the company may incur significant associated costs.

     Weighted Average Variable Interest Rate. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal amount of our variable-rate
indebtedness aggregated $11.7 billion, and the weighted average interest rate (including margin) on such variable-rate indebtedness
was approximately 4.2%, excluding the effects of interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums
or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding,
and without giving effect to any interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts
and commitment fees, a hypothetical 50 basis point (0.50%) increase (decrease) in our weighted average variable interest rate
would increase (decrease) our annual consolidated interest expense and cash outflows by $58.5 million. As discussed above and
in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to increases
in variable interest rates. In this regard, increases in the fair value of these contracts generally would be expected to offset most
of the economic impact of increases in the variable interest rates applicable to our indebtedness to the extent and during the period
that principal amounts are matched with interest rate derivative contracts.

  Counterparty Credit Risk

      We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments
of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation
and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk
associated with our derivative instruments and undrawn debt facilities is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of
banks and financial institutions. With the exception of a limited number of instances where we have required a counterparty to
post collateral, neither party has posted collateral under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. Collateral
is generally not posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. Most of our cash
currently is invested in either (i) AAA credit rated money market funds, including funds that invest in government obligations, or
(ii) overnight deposits with banks having a minimum credit rating of A by Standard & Poor’s or an equivalent rating by Moody’s
Investor Service. To date, neither the access to nor the value of our cash and cash equivalent balances have been adversely impacted
by liquidity problems of financial institutions.

     At December 31, 2018, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (i) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of
$617.3 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,498.3 million and (iii) aggregate undrawn debt
facilities of $2,503.8 million.

     Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each
counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such
derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements are limited to the derivative instruments, and derivative-related debt
instruments, governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar
arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups.

     Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination
payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty.
Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed
to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty,
even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our
ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we

                                                                   II-56
will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value
of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty.

    In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may
be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel,
without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant
counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

    While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material
credit risk exposures, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable
to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial
condition and/or liquidity.

    Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key vendors, the financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our
operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows.

  Sensitivity Information

    Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes
in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated
with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency. For additional information, see
notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

  Virgin Media Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts

     Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2018, an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the
British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Virgin Media
cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately £560 million ($714 million).

  UPC Holding Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2018:

    (i)     an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the Swiss franc, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Czech
            koruna and Romanian lei relative to the euro would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the UPC

            approximately €242 million ($277 million); and

    (iii)   an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar would have
            decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the UPC Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts
            by approximately €92 million ($105 million).

Telenet Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts

    Holding all other factors constant, at December 31, 2018:

    (i)     an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10% in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased
            (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Telenet cross-currency derivative contracts by approximately €330 million
            ($378 million); and

    (ii)    an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50%) would have increased (decreased)
            the aggregate fair value of the Telenet cross currency, interest rate cap and swap contracts by approximately €106
            million ($121 million).

                        Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting


     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     Our management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, using the
criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.




                                                                II-60

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Liberty Global plc:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I and II (collectively, the consolidated financial
statements), and our report dated February 27, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Liberty Global plc:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement
schedules I and II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue
from contracts with customers in 2018 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

in Austria through July 31, 2018, the date we completed the sale of such operations. On May 9, 2018, we reached an agreement
to sell our operations in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic (exclusive of our DTH operations) and on December
21, 2018, we reached an agreement to sell the operations of UPC DTH. In these consolidated financial statements, our operations
in Austria, Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic and the operations of UPC DTH are presented as discontinued
operations for all periods. For additional information regarding these pending and completed dispositions, see note 6. Subsequent
to December 31, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our operations in Switzerland. For additional information, see note
21.

     Prior to the December 29, 2017 completion of the Split-off Transaction (as defined and described in note 6), we also provided
residential and B2B communication services in (i) various countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, through Cable & Wireless
Communications Limited (C&W), (ii) Chile through VTR.com SpA (VTR) and (iii) Puerto Rico through Liberty Cablevision of
Puerto Rico LLC (Liberty Puerto Rico). C&W and VTR were each wholly-owned subsidiaries of Liberty Global, and Liberty
Puerto Rico was an entity in which we held a 60.0% ownership interest. C&W also provided (a) B2B services in certain other
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (b) wholesale services over its sub-sea and terrestrial networks. The operations
of C&W, VTR, Liberty Puerto Rico and certain other entities that were associated with our businesses in Latin America and the
Caribbean are collectively referred to herein as the “LiLAC Group.” As a result of the Split-off Transaction, the entities attributed
to the LiLAC Group are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for 2017
and 2016.

    Unless otherwise indicated, the amounts presented in these notes relate only to our continuing operations, and ownership
percentages and convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2018.

(2)      Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  Accounting Changes

      ASU 2014-09

     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which
it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. We adopted ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 by
recording the cumulative effect of the adoption to our accumulated deficit. We applied the new standard to contracts that were not
complete at January 1, 2018. The comparative information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 contained within
these consolidated financial statements and notes has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards
in effect for such periods. The implementation of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
                                                               II-72
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


statements.

    The principal impacts of ASU 2014-09 on our revenue recognition policies relate to our accounting for (i) time-limited discounts
and free service periods provided to our customers and (ii) certain upfront fees charged to our customers, as follows:

    •    When we enter into contracts to provide services to our customers, we often provide time-limited discounts or free service
         periods. Under previous accounting rules, we recognized revenue, net of discounts, during the promotional periods and
         did not recognize any revenue during free service periods. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue recognition for those contracts
         that contain substantive termination penalties is recognized uniformly over the contractual period. For contracts that do
         not have substantive termination penalties, we continue to record the impacts of partial or full discounts during the
         applicable promotional periods.

    •    When we enter into contracts to provide services to our customers, we often charge installation or other upfront fees. Under
         previous accounting rules, installation fees related to services provided over our cable networks were recognized as
         revenue during the period in which the installation occurred to the extent these fees were equal to or less than direct selling
         costs. Under ASU 2014-09, these fees are generally deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual period, or
         longer if the upfront fee results in a material renewal right.

     ASU 2014-09 also impacted our accounting for certain upfront costs directly associated with obtaining and fulfilling customer
contracts. Under our previous policy, these costs were expensed as incurred unless the costs were in the scope of another accounting
topic that allowed for capitalization. Under ASU 2014-09, certain upfront costs associated with contracts that have substantive
termination penalties and a term of one year or more are recognized as assets and amortized to operating costs and expenses over
the applicable period benefited.

    For additional information regarding the impact of our adoption of ASU 2014-09, see note 4.

_______________

(a)     The ASU 2014-09 adjustment amounts include the impact of our share of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s adjustment to its owners’
        equity.

     The impact of our adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 was not materially
different from the impacts set forth in the above January 1, 2018 summary balance sheet information. Similarly, the adoption of
ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.

      ASU 2017-07

     In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of the Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net
Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASU 2017-07), which changes the presentation of periodic benefit cost components. Under
ASU 2017-07, we continue to present the service component of our net periodic pension cost as a component of operating income
but present the other components of our net periodic pension cost, which can include credits, within non-operating income (expense)
in our consolidated statements of operations. We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis, which resulted
in the reclassification of credits from SG&A expense to other non-operating income, net of $18.2 million and $14.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For information regarding our defined benefit plans, see note 16.

    ASU 2016-01

     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial
instruments. ASU 2016-01 primarily impacts our accounting for certain equity investments that were previously accounted for
under the cost method. Under ASU 2016-01, these investments, which do not have readily determinable fair values, are accounted
for at cost minus impairment, adjusted for any observable price changes of similar investments of the same issuer. We adopted the
amendments of ASU 2016-01 related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values on January 1, 2018 on a prospective
basis.

    ASU 2016-18

    In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires the change in restricted
cash to be included together with the change in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows. We adopted
ASU 2016-18 on January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis.

    ASU 2016-09

     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-
Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification within
the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017. As a result of adopting this standard, we (i) recognized
a cumulative effect adjustment to our accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2017 and (ii) retrospectively revised the presentation
of our consolidated statements of cash flows to remove the operating cash outflows and financing cash inflows associated with
excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The cumulative effect adjustment, which totaled $15.3 million, represents the
tax effect of deductions in excess of the financial reporting expense for share-based compensation that were not previously
recognized for financial reporting purposes as these tax benefits were not realized as a reduction of income taxes payable.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

    ASU 2016-02

     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), which, for most leases, will result in lessees
recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and additional disclosures. ASU 2016-02, as amended by
ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the
earliest period presented using one of two modified retrospective approaches. A number of optional practical expedients may be
applied in transition. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 by recording the
cumulative effect of adoption to our accumulated deficit.

     The main impact of the adoption of this standard will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting principles generally accepted
in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). We will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less,
as permitted by the short-term lease practical expedient in the standard. We generally do not plan to apply the practical expedient
that permits a lessee to account for lease and non-lease components in a contract as a single lease component and, accordingly,
we will continue to account for these components separately. In transition, we will apply the practical expedients that permit us
not to reassess (i) whether expired or existing contracts contain a lease under the new standard, (ii) the lease classification for
expired or existing leases or (iii) whether previously-capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under the new
standard. In addition, we will not use hindsight during transition.

     We are in the process of implementing a new lease accounting system and related internal controls to meet the requirements
of ASU 2016-02. While we are still evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated balance sheet, we expect
to record significant right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities upon adoption. We do not expect our adoption of ASU
2016-02 will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations or cash flows.


                                                                II-75

    Our current operating lease portfolio primarily includes leases related to network equipment, real estate and mobile site sharing.
For a summary of our undiscounted future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31,
2018, see note 18.

      ASU 2018-15

     In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud
Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract (ASU 2018-15), which requires entities to defer implementation costs incurred
that are related to the application development stage in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. Deferred
implementation costs will be amortized over the term of the cloud computing arrangement and presented in the same expense line
item as the cloud computing arrangement. All other implementation costs will be expensed as incurred. ASU 2018-15 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early
adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

(3)       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things,
the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, certain components of revenue,
programming and copyright costs, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair value
measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities,
useful lives of long-lived assets, share-based compensation and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

  Reclassifications

      Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

  Principles of Consolidation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all voting interest entities where
we exercise a controlling financial interest through the ownership of a direct or indirect controlling voting interest and variable
interest entities for which our company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

     Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and other investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities
of three months or less at the time of acquisition. We record money market funds at the net asset value as there are no restrictions
on our ability, contractual or otherwise, to redeem our investments at the stated net asset value.

     Restricted cash consists of cash held in restricted accounts, including cash held as collateral for debt and other compensating
balances. Restricted cash amounts that are required to be used to purchase long-term assets or repay long-term debt are classified
as long-term assets. All other cash that is restricted to a specific use is classified as current or long-term based on the expected
timing of the disbursement.

     Our significant non-cash investing and financing activities are disclosed in our consolidated statements of equity and in notes
5, 6, 8, 10, and 11.




                                                                II-76

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


  Trade Receivables

    Our trade receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful
accounts was $74.2 million. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, our allowance increased to $86.1 million, and
at December 31, 2018, our allowance was $45.8 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of
probable loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We use a number of factors in determining the allowance, including,
among other things, collection trends, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk. The
allowance is maintained until either payment is received or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote.

    Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of residential and business
customers. We also manage this risk by disconnecting services to customers whose accounts are delinquent.

  Investments

     We make elections, on an investment-by-investment basis, as to whether we measure our investments at fair value. Such
elections are generally irrevocable. With the exception of those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we
generally elect the fair value method. For those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we generally elect the
equity method.

     Under the fair value method, investments are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value are reported in realized and
unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair values of certain investments and debt, net, in our consolidated statements of
operations. All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment to be accounted for using the fair value method are
expensed as incurred. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are recorded at cost and are subsequently increased or
reduced to reflect our share of income or losses of the investee. All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment
to be accounted for using the equity method are included in the carrying amount of the investment. For additional information
regarding our fair value and equity method investments, see notes 7 and 9.

     Under the equity method, investments, originally recorded at cost, are adjusted to recognize our share of net earnings or losses
of the affiliates as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received, with our recognition of losses generally
limited to the extent of our investment in, and advances and commitments to, the investee. The portion of the difference between
our investment and our share of the net assets of the investee that represents goodwill is not amortized, but continues to be considered
for impairment. Profits on transactions with equity affiliates for which assets remain on our or our investee’s balance sheet are
eliminated to the extent of our ownership in the investee.

     Dividends from publicly-traded investees that are not accounted for under the equity method are recognized when declared
as dividend income in our consolidated statements of operations. Dividends from our equity method investees and all of our
privately-held investees are reflected as reductions of the carrying values of the applicable investments. Dividends that are deemed
to be (i) returns on our investments are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash
flows and (ii) returns of our investments are included in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of
cash flows.

     We continually review all of our equity investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-
than-temporary. The primary factors we consider in our determination are the extent and length of time that the fair value of the
investment is below our company’s carrying value and the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of
the investee, changes in the stock price or valuation subsequent to the balance sheet date, and the impacts of exchange rates, if
applicable. If the decline in fair value of an equity or cost method investment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis
of the security is written down to fair value.

    Realized gains and losses are determined on an average cost basis. Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date.




                                                                 II-77

  Financial Instruments

    Due to the short maturities of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term liquid investments, trade and other
receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other accrued and current liabilities, their respective
carrying values approximate their respective fair values. For information concerning the fair values of certain of our investments,
derivatives and debt, see notes 7, 8 and 11, respectively. For information regarding how we arrive at certain of our fair value
measurements, see note 9.

  Derivative Instruments

     All derivative instruments, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in
earnings. If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument are recorded in other comprehensive earnings or loss and subsequently reclassified into our consolidated
statements of operations when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value
of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. With the exception of a limited number of our foreign currency forward contracts,
we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.

    The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or financing activity
in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument and the classification of the
applicable underlying cash flows. For derivative contracts that are terminated prior to maturity, the cash paid or received upon
termination that relates to future periods is classified as a financing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

     For information regarding our derivative instruments, see note 8.

      Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. We capitalize costs associated with the construction
of new cable and mobile transmission and distribution facilities and the installation of new cable services. Capitalized construction
and installation costs include materials, labor and other directly attributable costs. Installation activities that are capitalized include
(i) the initial connection (or drop) from our cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation
of equipment for additional services, such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-
facing activities, such as reconnecting and disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as
incurred. Interest capitalized with respect to construction activities was not material during any of the periods presented.

    Capitalized internal-use software is included as a component of property and equipment. We capitalize internal and external
costs directly associated with the development of internal-use software. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of
software licenses. Maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of an internal-use software
development project, are expensed as incurred.

     Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. Equipment
under capital leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.
Useful lives used to depreciate our property and equipment are assessed periodically and are adjusted when warranted. The useful
lives of cable and mobile distribution systems that are undergoing a rebuild are adjusted such that property and equipment to be
retired will be fully depreciated by the time the rebuild is completed. For additional information regarding the useful lives of our
property and equipment, see note 10.

    Additions, replacements and improvements that extend the asset life are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are charged to
operations.

     We recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is incurred if sufficient information is available
to make a reasonable estimate of fair values. Asset retirement obligations may arise from the loss of rights of way that we obtain
from local municipalities or other relevant authorities, as well as our obligations under certain lease arrangements to restore the
property to its original condition at the end of the lease term. Given the nature of our operations, most of our rights of way and
certain leased premises are considered integral to our business. Accordingly, for most of our rights of way and certain lease

                                                                   II-78

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


agreements, the possibility is remote that we will incur significant removal costs in the foreseeable future and, as such, we do not
have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of fair value for these asset retirement obligations.

    As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the recorded value of our asset retirement obligations was $53.5 million and $58.3 million,
respectively.

  Intangible Assets

     Our primary intangible assets relate to goodwill and customer relationships. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Customer relationships are initially recorded
at their fair value in connection with business combinations.

     Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives
to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment.

    For additional information regarding the useful lives of our intangible assets, see note 10.

  Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

     When circumstances warrant, we review the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets (other
than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse
changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which
we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see
below). If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by
such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying
value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar
assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets
to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

     We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1 and whenever
facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to
both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value
is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. Any excess
of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. A reporting unit is an operating
segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). With respect to other indefinite-lived intangible
assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then
estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.




                                                                  II-79

                                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                               December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


  Income Taxes

     Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax basis of assets
and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect
for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits,
that the position will be sustained upon examination. Net deferred tax assets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if we
believe it is more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Certain of our valuation allowances and tax
uncertainties are associated with entities that we acquired in business combinations. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax liabilities related to
investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration are not recognized
until it becomes apparent that such amounts will reverse in the foreseeable future. In order to be considered essentially permanent
in duration, sufficient evidence must indicate that the foreign subsidiary has invested or will invest its undistributed earnings
indefinitely, or that earnings will be remitted in a tax-free manner. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included
in income tax benefit or expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

    For additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 12.

  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

     The reporting currency of our company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign operations generally is the
applicable local currency for each foreign subsidiary and equity method investee. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
(including intercompany balances for which settlement is not anticipated in the foreseeable future) are translated at the spot rate
in effect at the applicable reporting date. With the exception of certain material transactions, the amounts reported in our consolidated
statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized
cumulative translation adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss in our consolidated statements of equity. With the exception of certain material transactions, the cash flows from
our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the applicable period in our consolidated statements of
cash flows. The impacts of material transactions generally are recorded at the applicable spot rates in our consolidated statements
of operations and cash flows. The effect of exchange rates on cash balances held in foreign currencies are separately reported in
our consolidated statements of cash flows.

     Transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are recorded based on exchange
rates at the time such transactions arise. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance
sheets related to these non-functional currency transactions result in transaction gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated
statements of operations as unrealized (based on the applicable period end exchange rates) or realized upon settlement of the
transactions.

  Revenue Recognition

     Service Revenue — Cable Networks. We recognize revenue from the provision of video, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services over our cable network to customers in the period the related services are provided, with the exception of
revenue recognized pursuant to certain contracts that contain promotional discounts, as described below. Installation fees related
to services provided over our cable network are generally deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual period, or longer
if the upfront fee results in a material renewal right.

     Sale of Multiple Products and Services. We sell video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets,
mobile services to our customers in bundled packages at a rate lower than if the customer purchased each product on a standalone
basis. Revenue from bundled packages generally is allocated proportionally to the individual products or services based on the
relative standalone selling price for each respective product or service.

    Mobile Revenue — General. Consideration from mobile contracts is allocated to the airtime service component and the handset
component based on the relative standalone selling prices of each component. In markets where we offer handsets and airtime
services in separate contracts entered into at the same time, we account for these contracts as a single contract.

                                                                  II-80

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


     Mobile Revenue — Airtime Services. We recognize revenue from mobile services in the period in which the related services
are provided. Revenue from pre-pay customers is deferred prior to the commencement of services and recognized as the services
are rendered or usage rights expire.

     Mobile Revenue — Handset Revenue. Revenue from the sale of handsets is recognized at the point in which the goods have
been transferred to the customer. Some of our mobile handset contracts that permit the customer to take control of the handset
upfront and pay for the handset in installments over a contractual period may contain a significant financing component. For
contracts with terms of one year or more, we recognize any significant financing component as revenue over the contractual period
using the effective interest method. We do not record the effect of a significant financing component if the contractual period is
less than one year.

    B2B Revenue. We defer upfront installation and certain nonrecurring fees received on B2B contracts where we maintain
ownership of the installed equipment. The deferred fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis, generally over the
longer of the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance.

     Contract Costs. Incremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer, such as incremental sales commissions, are generally
recognized as assets and amortized to SG&A expenses over the applicable period benefited, which generally is the contract life.
If, however, the amortization period is less than one year, we expense such costs in the period incurred. Contract fulfillment costs,
such as costs for installation activities for B2B customers, are recognized as assets and amortized to other operating costs over
the applicable period benefited, which is generally the substantive contract term for the related service contract.

     Promotional Discounts. For subscriber promotions, such as discounted or free services during an introductory period, revenue
is recognized uniformly over the contractual period if the contract has substantive termination penalties. If a contract does not
have substantive termination penalties, revenue is recognized only to the extent of the discounted monthly fees charged to the
subscriber, if any.

    Subscriber Advance Payments. Payments received in advance for the services we provide are deferred and recognized as
revenue when the associated services are provided.

    Sales, Use and Other Value-Added Taxes. Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales, use and other value-added taxes.

    For additional information regarding our revenue recognition and related costs, see note 4. For a disaggregation of our revenue
by major category and by reportable and geographic segment, see note 19.

  Share-based Compensation

     We recognize all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee share-based incentive awards, based on
their grant-date fair values and our estimates of forfeitures. We recognize the grant-date fair value of outstanding awards as a
charge to operations over the vesting period. Our share of payroll taxes incurred in connection with the vesting or exercise of our
share-based incentive awards are recorded as a component of share-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements
of operations.

    We use the straight-line method to recognize share-based compensation expense for our outstanding share awards that do not
contain a performance condition and the accelerated expense attribution method for our outstanding share awards that contain a
performance condition and vest on a graded basis.

    The grant date fair values for options, share appreciation rights (SARs) and performance-based share appreciation rights
(PSARs) are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the grant date fair values for restricted share units
(RSUs) and performance-based restricted share units (PSUs) are based upon the closing share price of Liberty Global ordinary
shares on the date of grant. We consider historical exercise trends in our calculation of the expected life of options and SARs
granted by Liberty Global to employees. The expected volatility for options and SARs related to our ordinary shares is generally
based on a combination of (i) historical volatilities for a period equal to the expected average life of the awards and (ii) volatilities
implied from publicly-traded options for our shares.



                                                                 II-81

    We generally issue new Liberty Global ordinary shares when Liberty Global options or SARs are exercised and when RSUs
and PSUs vest. Although we repurchase Liberty Global ordinary shares from time to time, the parameters of our share purchase
and redemption activities are not established with reference to the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation plans.

     For additional information regarding our share-based compensation, see note 14.

  Litigation Costs

     Legal fees and related litigation costs are expensed as incurred.

  Earnings or Loss per Share

    Basic earnings or loss per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect, if any, on a per share basis of potential shares (e.g., options,
SARs, RSUs and PSUs) as if they had been exercised, vested or converted at the beginning of the periods presented.

    The details of our net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Liberty Global shareholders are set forth
below:

     We reported losses from continuing operations attributable to Liberty Global shareholders during 2018 and 2017. Therefore,
the potentially dilutive effect at December 31, 2018 and 2017 of the following items was not included in the computation of diluted
loss from continuing operations attributable to Liberty Global shareholders per share because their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive to the computation or, in the case of certain PSUs, because such awards had not yet met the applicable performance
criteria, including (i) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options, SARs and RSUs of 58.7 million
and 53.7 million, respectively, and (ii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to PSUs of 9.2 million and 6.2 million,

(4)    Revenue Recognition and Related Costs

  Contract Balances

     If we transfer goods or services to a customer but do not have an unconditional right to payment, we record a contract asset.
Contract assets typically arise from the uniform recognition of introductory promotional discounts over the contract period and
accrued revenue for handset sales. Our contract assets were $44.3 million and $26.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and January
1, 2018, respectively. The current and long-term portions of our contract asset balance at December 31, 2018 are included within
other current assets and other assets, net, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.

     We record deferred revenue when we receive payment prior to transferring goods or services to a customer. We primarily
defer revenue for (i) installation and other upfront services and (ii) other services that are invoiced prior to when services are
provided. Our deferred revenue balances were $877.9 million and $999.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018,
respectively. The decrease in deferred revenue during 2018 is primarily due to $901.4 million of revenue recognized that was
included in our deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2018, partially offset by advanced billings in certain markets. The current
and long-term portions of our deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2018 are included within deferred revenue and other
long-term liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.

  Contract Costs

    Our aggregate assets associated with incremental costs to obtain and fulfill our contracts were $73.0 million and $68.1 million
at December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively. The current and long-term portions of our assets related to contract costs
at December 31, 2018 are included within other current assets and other assets, net, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.
We amortized $99.8 million to operating costs and expenses during 2018 related to these assets.

  Unsatisfied Performance Obligations

    A large portion of our revenue is derived from customers who are not subject to contracts. Revenue from customers who are
subject to contracts is generally recognized over the term of such contracts, which is typically 12 months for our residential service
contracts, one to three years for our mobile service contracts and one to five years for our B2B service contracts.

(5)         Acquisitions

  2017 Acquisition

    SFR BeLux. On June 19, 2017, Telenet acquired Coditel Brabant sprl, operating under the SFR brand (SFR BeLux), for a
cash and debt free purchase price of €369.0 million ($410.3 million at the applicable rates) (the SFR BeLux Acquisition) after
post-closing adjustments. SFR BeLux provides cable and mobile services to households and businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg
and offers mobile services in Belgium through a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with BASE, as defined and
described below. The SFR BeLux Acquisition was funded through a combination of €210.0 million ($234.3 million at the transaction
date) of borrowings under the Telenet Credit Facility (as defined and described in note 11) and existing liquidity of Telenet.

  2016 Acquisitions

     BASE. On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired Telenet Group BVBA, formerly known as BASE Company NV (BASE), for
a cash purchase price of €1,318.9 million ($1,494.3 million at the transaction date) (the BASE Acquisition). At the time, BASE
was the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium. Telenet completed the BASE Acquisition in order to gain cost-effective
long-term mobile access to effectively compete for future growth opportunities in the Belgium mobile market. The BASE
Acquisition was funded through €1.0 billion ($1.1 billion at the transaction date) of new debt facilities and existing liquidity of
Telenet. The acquisition was approved by the European Commission subject to Telenet’s agreement to divest both the JIM Mobile
prepaid customer base and BASE’s 50% stake in Viking Co NV (Viking). In February 2016, Telenet completed the sale of its
stake in Viking, and in October 2017, Telenet completed the sale of the JIM Mobile customer base.

     We have accounted for the BASE Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price
was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of BASE based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of the purchase
price and the opening balance sheet of BASE at the February 11, 2016 acquisition date is presented in the following table. The
opening balance sheet presented below reflects our final purchase price allocation (in millions):

(a)      The goodwill recognized in connection with the BASE Acquisition was primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take
         advantage of BASE’s existing mobile network to gain immediate access to potential customers and (ii) estimated synergy
         benefits through the integration of BASE with Telenet.

(b)      As of February 11, 2016, the weighted average useful life of BASE’s mobile spectrum, customer relationships and trademarks
         was approximately 11 years, seven years and 20 years, respectively.

(c)      Excludes direct acquisition costs of $17.1 million, including $7.1 million incurred during 2016, which is included in
         impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statement of operations.

     C&W. On May 16, 2016, we acquired C&W for shares of Liberty Global (the C&W Acquisition). Under the terms of the
transaction, C&W shareholders received in the aggregate: 31,607,008 Class A Liberty Global Shares, 77,379,774 Class C Liberty
Global Shares, 3,648,513 Class A LiLAC Shares and 8,939,316 Class C LiLAC Shares (the terms “Liberty Global Shares” and
“LiLAC Shares” as defined in note 13). Further, immediately prior to the acquisition, C&W declared a special cash dividend (the
Special Dividend) to its shareholders in the amount of £0.03 ($0.04 at the transaction date) per C&W share. C&W was attributed
to the LiLAC Group and, accordingly, as a result of the Split-off Transaction (as defined and described in note 6), is included
within discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for 2017 and 2016.

    For accounting purposes, the C&W Acquisition was treated as the acquisition of C&W by Liberty Global. In this regard, the
equity and cash consideration paid to acquire C&W is set forth below (in millions):

Class A Liberty Global Shares (a) ........................................................................................................................ $                        1,167.2
Class C Liberty Global Shares (a)........................................................................................................................                           2,803.5
Class A LiLAC Shares (a) ....................................................................................................................................                         144.1
Class C LiLAC Shares (a) ....................................................................................................................................                         375.3
Special Dividend (b).............................................................................................................................................                     193.8
   Total................................................................................................................................................................. $         4,683.9
_______________

(a)      Represents the fair value of the 31,607,008 Class A Liberty Global Shares, 77,379,774 Class C Liberty Global Shares,
         3,648,513 Class A LiLAC Shares and 8,939,316 Class C LiLAC Shares issued to C&W shareholders in connection with
         the C&W Acquisition. These amounts are based on the market price per share at closing on May 16, 2016 of $36.93, $36.23,
         $39.50 and $41.98, respectively.

(b)      The Special Dividend amount is based on 4,433,222,313 outstanding shares of C&W on May 16, 2016.

     Due to the fact that C&W was attributed to the LiLAC Group, the use of Liberty Global Shares as partial consideration for
the C&W Acquisition created an inter-group interest in the LiLAC Group representing the fair value (as determined by our board
of directors) of the Liberty Global Shares issued as part of the purchase consideration. On July 1, 2016, we distributed (as a bonus
issue) 117,430,965 LiLAC Shares to shareholders of Liberty Global Shares on a pro-rata basis (the LiLAC Distribution), thereby
eliminating this inter-group interest. The LiLAC Distribution was accounted for prospectively effective July 1, 2016.

  Pro Forma Information

     The following unaudited pro forma consolidated operating results give effect to the BASE Acquisition as if it had been
completed as of January 1, 2016. No effect has been given to the SFR BeLux Acquisition since it would not have had a significant
impact on our results of operations during 2017 or 2016. These pro forma amounts, which relate only to our continuing operations,
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if this transaction had occurred on such date. The
pro forma adjustments are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
                                                                                                                                                                               Year ended

(6)      Dispositions and the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction

  Pending and Completed Dispositions

      Vodafone Disposal Group

     On May 9, 2018, we reached an agreement (the Vodafone Agreement) to sell our operations in Germany, Hungary, the Czech
Republic and Romania to Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone). The cash proceeds that we receive from the transaction will be calculated
on the basis of the agreed enterprise value adjusted for the net debt and working capital of such businesses as of the closing date
of the transaction, as well as other post-closing adjustments. Based on the net debt and working capital of such businesses as of
December 31, 2017, the cash proceeds would be approximately €10.6 billion ($12.1 billion). The operations of Germany, Romania,
Hungary and the Czech Republic are collectively referred to herein as the “Vodafone Disposal Group.”

     Closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including regulatory approval, which we expect will be obtained
in mid-2019. The Vodafone Agreement contains certain termination rights for both our company and Vodafone, including if closing
has not occurred by November 9, 2019, or May 9, 2020 in certain limited circumstances. If the Vodafone Agreement terminates
because the condition to obtain antitrust approval is not met, Vodafone has agreed to pay us a compensatory payment of €250.0
million ($286.3 million). Pursuant to the Vodafone Agreement, our company will retain all cash generated from the Vodafone
Disposal Group through the closing of the transaction.

    In connection with the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services for a
period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions. The annual
charges will depend on the actual level of services required by Vodafone.

      UPC Austria

      On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our Austrian operations, “UPC Austria,” to Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche
Telekom). After considering debt, working capital and noncontrolling interest adjustments and $35.5 million (equivalent at the
transaction date) of cash paid by our company to settle centrally-held vendor financing obligations associated with UPC Austria,
we received net cash proceeds of $2,058.2 million (equivalent at the applicable rates). A portion of the net proceeds were used to
repay or redeem an aggregate $1.5 billion (equivalent at the applicable dates) principal amount of our outstanding debt, including
(i) the repayment of $913.4 million (equivalent at the repayment date) principal amount under the UPC Holding Bank Facility,
(ii) the redemption of $69.6 million (equivalent at the redemption date) principal amount of the UPCB SPE Notes and (iii) the
redemption of $515.5 million (equivalent at the redemption date) principal amount of the VM Notes. The remaining net proceeds
from the sale of UPC Austria were made available for general corporate purposes, including an additional $500.0 million of share
repurchases, as further described in note 13.

     In connection with the sale of UPC Austria, we recognized a gain of $1,098.1 million that includes cumulative foreign currency
translation gains of $79.5 million. No income taxes were required to be provided on this gain, which is included in gain on disposal
of discontinued operations, net of taxes, in our consolidated statement of operations.

     In connection with the sale of UPC Austria, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Deutsche Telekom for
a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions. The annual
charges will depend on the actual level of services required by Deutsche Telekom. During 2018, we recorded revenue of $17.9
million associated with these transitional services.

      UPC DTH

    On December 21, 2018, we reached an agreement (the UPC DTH Agreement) to sell the operations of UPC DTH to M7
Group (M7) for an enterprise value of approximately €180 million ($206 million), subject to customary debt and working capital
adjustments at completion. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, which is expected in the first half of 2019.
The proceeds from the sale of UPC DTH are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include leverage
reduction for the remaining UPC Holding borrowing group, re-investment into our business and support for our share repurchase
program.


                                                               II-86

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


    In connection with the sale of UPC DTH, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to M7 for a period of up to
two years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions. The annual charges will
depend on the actual level of services required by the purchaser.

    Subsequent event

     Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our operations in Switzerland. For additional
information, see note 21.

  Split-off Transaction

     On December 29, 2017, in order to effect the split-off of the LiLAC Group (the Split-off Transaction), we distributed 100%
of the common shares (the Distribution) of Liberty Latin America Ltd. (Liberty Latin America) to the holders of our then
outstanding LiLAC Shares. Just prior to the completion of the Split-off Transaction, all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of
the LiLAC Group were transferred to Liberty Latin America, which was then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global.
Following the Distribution, the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (which had virtually no economic rights) and
Liberty Latin America became an independent publicly-traded company that is no longer consolidated by Liberty Global. No gain
or loss was recognized in connection with the Split-off Transaction.

    In connection with the Split-off Transaction, we entered into several agreements that govern certain transactions and other
matters between our company and Liberty Latin America (the Split-off Agreements). The following summarizes the material
agreements:

    •    a reorganization agreement (the Reorganization Agreement), which provides for, among other things, the principal
         corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Split-off Transaction, certain conditions
         to the Split-off Transaction and provisions governing the relationship between Liberty Global and Liberty Latin America
         with respect to and resulting from the Split-off Transaction;

    •    a tax sharing agreement (the Tax Sharing Agreement), which governs the parties’ respective rights, responsibilities and
         obligations with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax matters;

    •    a services agreement (the Services Agreement), pursuant to which, for up to two years following the Split-off Transaction,
         with the option to renew for a one-year period, Liberty Global will provide Liberty Latin America with specified services,
         including access to Liberty Global’s procurement team and tools to leverage scale and take advantage of joint purchasing
         opportunities, certain management services, other services to support Liberty Latin America’s legal, tax, accounting and
         finance departments, and certain technical and information technology services (including software development services
         associated with Horizon TV, our next generation multimedia home gateway, management information systems, computer,
         data storage, and network and telecommunications services);

    •    a sublease agreement (the Sublease Agreement), pursuant to which Liberty Latin America will sublease office space
         from Liberty Global in Denver, Colorado until May 31, 2031, subject to customary termination and notice provisions;
         and

    •    a facilities sharing agreement (the Facilities Sharing Agreement), pursuant to which, for as long as the Sublease
         Agreement remains in effect, Liberty Latin America will pay a fee for the usage of certain facilities at the office space
         in Denver, Colorado.

    During 2018, the impacts of the Split-off Agreements and other normal recurring transactions between our company and
Liberty Latin America were not material.

  Presentation of Discontinued Operations

    The operations of the Vodafone Disposal Group, UPC Austria and UPC DTH are presented as discontinued operations in our
consolidated financial statements for all periods. In connection with the signing of each respective sale agreement, we ceased to
depreciate or amortize the long-lived assets of (i) UPC Austria on December 22, 2017, (ii) the Vodafone Disposal Group on May

                                                                II-87

9, 2018 and (iii) UPC DTH on December 21, 2018. Our operations in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic and the operations
of UPC DTH are held through UPC Holding, as was UPC Austria prior to its sale on July 31, 2018. No debt, interest expense or
derivative instruments of the UPC Holding borrowing group, other than with respect to certain borrowings that are direct obligations
of the entities to be disposed, has been allocated to discontinued operations. Conversely, all of Unitymedia’s debt, interest expense
and derivative instruments are included in discontinued operations as its debt and derivative instruments are direct obligations of
entities within the Vodafone Disposal Group. As discussed above, a portion of the proceeds from the disposition of UPC Austria
was used to reduce the outstanding debt of the UPC Holding borrowing group, and we expect that a portion of the proceeds from
the pending disposition of the Vodafone Disposal Group will be used to further reduce the outstanding debt of the UPC Holding
borrowing group.

    In addition, the entities comprising the LiLAC Group are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements
of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

    The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the Vodafone Disposal Group and UPC DTH as of
December 31, 2018 are summarized below. These amounts exclude intercompany assets and liabilities that are eliminated within
our consolidated balance sheet.

  VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction

      On December 31, 2016, pursuant to a Contribution and Transfer Agreement with Vodafone and one of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, we and Liberty Global Europe Holding B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary, contributed VodafoneZiggo Holding and
its subsidiaries (including Liberty Global Netherlands Content B.V., referred to herein as “Ziggo Sport”) to VodafoneZiggo Group
Holding B.V., a 50:50 joint venture (referred to herein as the “VodafoneZiggo JV”). Ziggo Sport, which became a subsidiary of
VodafoneZiggo Holding during the fourth quarter of 2016, operates premium sports channels in the Netherlands. The
VodafoneZiggo JV combined VodafoneZiggo Holding with Vodafone’s mobile businesses in the Netherlands to create a national
unified communications provider in the Netherlands with complementary strengths across video, broadband internet, fixed-line
telephony, mobile and B2B services (the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction). As a result of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction,
effective December 31, 2016, we no longer consolidate VodafoneZiggo Holding. For additional information regarding our
investment in the VodafoneZiggo JV, see note 7.

     On January 4, 2017, in connection with the completion of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, our company received cash of
€2.2 billion ($2.4 billion at the transaction date) comprising (i) our 50% share of the €2.8 billion ($2.9 billion at the transaction
date) of net proceeds from the various debt financing arrangements entered into by certain subsidiaries of VodafoneZiggo Holding
during the third quarter of 2016, which proceeds were held in escrow through December 31, 2016, and (ii) an equalization payment
from Vodafone of €802.9 million ($840.8 million at the transaction date) that was subject to post-closing adjustments. During the
second quarter of 2017, the equalization payment amount was finalized, resulting in the receipt of an additional €3.9 million ($4.5
million at the transaction date) from Vodafone.

     In connection with the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain during 2016 of $520.8 million, net of
the recognition of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $714.5 million. This gain, which was calculated by deducting
the carrying value of VodafoneZiggo Holding (including the related foreign currency translation loss) from the sum of (i) the fair
value assigned to our 50% interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV and (ii) the cash received pursuant to the equalization payment,
includes $260.4 million related to the remeasurement of our retained investment in VodafoneZiggo Holding. In connection with
the aforementioned finalization of the equalization payment, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $4.5 million during the
second quarter of 2017. For information regarding our approach to the valuation of our interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV, see note
9.

   Our consolidated statement of operations for 2016 includes an aggregate loss before income taxes attributable to
VodafoneZiggo Holding and Ziggo Sport of $276.4 million.

(b)      Amounts include a related-party euro-denominated note receivable (the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable) with a principal
         amount of $916.1 million and $1,081.9 million, respectively, due from a subsidiary of the VodafoneZiggo JV to a subsidiary
         of Liberty Global. The VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable bears interest at 5.55% and required €100.0 million ($114.5 million)
         of principal to be paid annually through December 31, 2019. In this regard, in December 2018, we received a €100.0 million
         ($114.5 million at the transaction date) principal payment on the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable. In 2018, the agreement
         was amended to (i) eliminate the requirement to pay an annual principal payment of €100.0 million in 2019 and (ii) extend
         the final maturity date from January 16, 2027 to January 16, 2028. The accrued interest on the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable
         will be payable in a manner mutually agreed upon by Liberty Global and the VodafoneZiggo JV. During 2018, interest
         accrued on the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable was $59.6 million, all of which was cash settled. For information regarding
         the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our accumulated deficit and our investment in the VodafoneZiggo JV, see
         note 2.

(c)      Amounts include our equity method investment in a media production company that we refer to as “All3Media”, for which
         summarized financial information has been provided below. All3Media is a joint venture in which we own a 50% interest.

(d)      At December 31, 2017, we owned 45,652,175 shares of Sumitomo common stock, representing less than 5% of the then
         outstanding common stock. During 2018, we used all of these shares to settle the outstanding amounts under certain related
         borrowings.

(e)      As a result of the January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU 2016-01, all of our cost investments have been reclassified to fair value
         investments.

_______________

(a)      Amounts include the net effect of (i) 100% of the interest income earned on the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivable, (ii) 100%
         of the share-based compensation expense associated with Liberty Global awards held by VodafoneZiggo JV employees
         who were formerly employees of Liberty Global, as these awards remain our responsibility, and (iii) our 50% share of the
         remaining results of operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV.

     VodafoneZiggo JV. Each of Liberty Global and Vodafone (each a “Shareholder”) holds 50% of the issued share capital of
the VodafoneZiggo JV. The Shareholders intend for the VodafoneZiggo JV to be funded solely from its net cash flow from operations
and third-party financing. We account for our 50% interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV as an equity method investment. We consider
the VodafoneZiggo JV to be a related party. For additional information regarding the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, see note
6.

     In connection with the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, the Shareholders entered into a shareholders agreement (the
Shareholders Agreement). The Shareholders Agreement contains customary provisions for the governance of a 50:50 joint venture
that result in Liberty Global and Vodafone having joint control over decision making with respect to the VodafoneZiggo JV.

     The Shareholders Agreement also provides (i) for a dividend policy that requires the VodafoneZiggo JV to distribute all
unrestricted cash to the Shareholders every two months (subject to the VodafoneZiggo JV maintaining a minimum amount of cash
and complying with the terms of its financing arrangements) and (ii) that the VodafoneZiggo JV will be managed with a leverage
ratio of between 4.5 and 5.0 times EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to its existing financing arrangements) with the VodafoneZiggo
JV undertaking periodic recapitalizations and/or refinancings accordingly.

    Each Shareholder has the right to initiate an initial public offering (IPO) of the VodafoneZiggo JV after December 31, 2019,
with the opportunity for the other Shareholder to sell shares in the IPO on a pro rata basis. Subject to certain exceptions, the
Shareholders Agreement prohibits transfers of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV to third parties until December 31, 2020. After
December 31, 2020, each Shareholder will be able to initiate a sale of all of its interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV to a third party
and, under certain circumstances, initiate a sale of the entire VodafoneZiggo JV, subject, in each case, to a right of first offer in
favor of the other Shareholder.

      During the first quarter of 2017, we paid $162.6 million of VAT on behalf of the VodafoneZiggo JV associated with the
termination of a services agreement with Ziggo Group Holding B.V. that was in effect prior to the closing of the VodafoneZiggo
JV Transaction. This advance was repaid during the first quarter of 2017. In addition, during 2018 and 2017, we received dividend
distributions from the VodafoneZiggo JV of $232.5 million and $252.8 million, respectively, which were accounted for as returns
on capital for purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows.

     Pursuant to an agreement entered into in connection with the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, (the Framework
Agreement), Liberty Global provides certain services to the VodafoneZiggo JV on a transitional or ongoing basis (collectively,
the JV Services). The JV Services provided by Liberty Global consist primarily of (i) technology and other services and (ii) capital-
related expenditures for assets that will be used by, or will otherwise benefit, the VodafoneZiggo JV. Liberty Global charges both
fixed and usage-based fees to the VodafoneZiggo JV for the JV Services provided during the term of the Framework Agreement.
During 2018 and 2017, we recorded revenue from the VodafoneZiggo JV of $189.1 million and $132.4 million, respectively,
primarily related to (a) the JV Services and (b) during 2018, sales of customer premises equipment at a mark-up. In addition,
during 2018 and 2017, we purchased certain assets on the VodafoneZiggo JV’s behalf with an aggregate cost of $13.1 million and
                                                                 II-93

$144.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $24.4 million and $33.3 million, respectively, were due from the
VodafoneZiggo JV, primarily related to the aforementioned and certain other transactions. These amounts due from the
VodafoneZiggo JV, which are periodically cash settled, are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

       The VodafoneZiggo JV is experiencing significant competition. In particular, the mobile operations of the VodafoneZiggo
JV continue to experience competitive pressure on pricing, characterized by aggressive promotion campaigns, heavy marketing
efforts and increasing or unlimited data bundles. In light of this competition, as well as regulatory and economic factors, we could
conclude in future periods that our investment in the VodafoneZiggo JV is impaired or management of the VodafoneZiggo JV
could conclude that an impairment of the VodafoneZiggo JV goodwill and, to a lesser extent, long-lived assets, is required. Any
such impairment of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s goodwill or our investment in the VodafoneZiggo JV would be reflected as a component
of share of results of affiliates, net, in our consolidated statement of operations. Our share of any such impairment charges could
be significant.

      The summarized results of operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV are set forth below:
                                                                                                                                                     Year ended December 31,

  Fair Value Investments

     ITV. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned 398,515,510 shares of ITV, a commercial broadcaster in the U.K. Our ITV
shares represented less than 10.0% of the total outstanding shares of ITV as of June 30, 2018, the most current publicly-available
information. The aggregate purchase price paid to acquire our investment in ITV was financed through borrowings under secured
borrowing agreements (the ITV Collar Loan). All of the ITV shares we hold are subject to a share collar (the ITV Collar) and
pledged as collateral under the ITV Collar Loan. Under the terms of the ITV Collar, the counterparty has the right to re-use all of
the pledged ITV shares. For additional information regarding the ITV Collar, see note 8.

    ITI Neovision. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned a 17.0% interest in ITI Neovision, a privately-held DTH operator
in Poland.

     Lionsgate. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned 2.5 million voting and 2.5 million non-voting shares of Lionsgate
common stock, originally purchased at a price of $39.02 per share, for an investment of $195.1 million. The aggregate purchase
price of the Lionsgate shares was financed using working capital, including $70.9 million of cash received pursuant to a variable
prepaid forward transaction with respect to 1.25 million of our voting and 1.25 million of our non-voting Lionsgate shares (the
Lionsgate Forward). At December 31, 2018, our Lionsgate shares represented less than 5% of the total outstanding shares of
Lionsgate. For additional information regarding the Lionsgate Forward, see note 8.

     Casa. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned 3,005,307 and 4,432,870 shares, respectively, of Casa common stock. Casa
is a U.S.-based provider of fixed, mobile, optical and Wi-Fi network software solutions for ultra-broadband services. Our Casa
shares represented less than 5.5% of the total outstanding shares of Casa as of October 31, 2018, the most current publicly-available
information.

(8)          Derivative Instruments

      In general, we enter into derivative instruments to protect against (i) increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt,
(ii) foreign currency movements, particularly with respect to borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency of the borrowing entity, and (iii) decreases in the market prices of certain publicly traded securities that we own. In this
regard, through our subsidiaries, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and foreign
currency exposure primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar ($), the euro (€), the British pound sterling (£), the Swiss franc (CHF),
the Czech koruna (CZK), the Hungarian forint (HUF), the Polish zloty (PLN) and the Romanian lei (RON). With the exception
of a limited number of our foreign currency forward contracts, we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.
Accordingly, changes in the fair values of most of our derivative instruments are recorded in realized and unrealized gains or losses
on derivative instruments, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.

_______________

(a)     Our current derivative liabilities, long-term derivative assets and long-term derivative liabilities are included in other current
        and accrued liabilities, other assets, net, and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.

(b)     We consider credit risk relating to our and our counterparties’ nonperformance in the fair value assessment of our derivative
        instruments. In all cases, the adjustments take into account offsetting liability or asset positions within each of our subsidiary
        borrowing groups (as defined and described in note 11). The changes in the credit risk valuation adjustments associated with
        our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts resulted in a net gains (losses) of ($71.1 million), $168.4 million
        and ($26.5 million) during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are included in realized and unrealized gains
        (losses) on derivative instruments, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. For further information regarding our
        fair value measurements, see note 9.

(c)     Our equity-related derivative instruments primarily include the fair value of (i) the ITV Collar , (ii) the Lionsgate Forward,
        and (iii) at December 31, 2017, the share collar (the Sumitomo Collar) with respect to a portion of the shares of Sumitomo
        held by our company. On May 22, 2018, we settled the final tranche of the Sumitomo Collar and related borrowings with a
        portion of the existing Sumitomo shares held by our company. The aggregate market value of these shares on the transaction
        date was $159.3 million. The fair values of the ITV Collar, the Sumitomo Collar and the Lionsgate Forward do not include
        credit risk valuation adjustments as we assume that any losses incurred by our company in the event of nonperformance by
        the respective counterparty would be, subject to relevant insolvency laws, fully offset against amounts we owe to such
        counterparty pursuant to the related secured borrowing arrangements.

     The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or financing activity
in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument and the classification of the applicable
underlying cash flows. For derivative contracts that are terminated prior to maturity, the cash paid or received upon termination
that relates to future periods is classified as a financing activity. The following table sets forth the classification of the net cash

  Counterparty Credit Risk

     We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default
on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and
concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is
spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. With the exception of a limited number of
instances where we have required a counterparty to post collateral, neither party has posted collateral under the derivative instruments
of our subsidiary borrowing groups. At December 31, 2018, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with
an aggregate fair value of $617.3 million.

     Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each
counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such
derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements are limited to the derivative instruments and derivative-related debt
instruments, governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar
arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups.

    Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early
termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination.
However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its
insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination

                                                                                              II-97
                                                                LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                                Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                                            December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly,
it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially
or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though
it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so
will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured
creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we
have obtained from that counterparty.

     In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may
be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without
any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty
or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

Details of our Derivative Instruments

  Cross-currency Derivative Contracts

     We generally match the denomination of our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the supporting operations
or, when it is more cost effective, we provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using
derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2018,
substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying
operations. The following table sets forth the total notional amounts and the related weighted average remaining contractual lives
of our cross-currency swap contracts at December 31, 2018:

_______________

(a)      Includes certain derivative instruments that do not involve the exchange of notional amounts at the inception and maturity
         of the instruments. Accordingly, the only cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are coupon-related payments
         and receipts. At December 31, 2018, the total U.S. dollar equivalents of the notional amount of these derivative instruments
         were $4.7 billion.

(b)      Includes certain derivative instruments that are “forward-starting,” such that the initial exchange occurs at a date subsequent
         to December 31, 2018. These instruments are typically entered into in order to extend existing hedges without the need to
         amend existing contracts.

  Interest Rate Swap Options

     We have entered into various interest rate swap options (swaptions), which give us the right, but not the obligation, to enter
into certain interest rate swap contracts at set dates in the future, with each such contract having a life of no more than three years.
At the transaction date, the strike rate of each of these contracts was above the corresponding market rate. The following table sets
forth certain information regarding our swaptions at December 31, 2018:

  Basis Swaps

     Our basis swaps involve the exchange of attributes used to calculate our floating interest rates, including (i) the benchmark
rate, (ii) the underlying currency and/or (iii) the borrowing period. We typically enter into these swaps to optimize our interest rate
profile based on our current evaluations of yield curves, our risk management policies and other factors. The following table sets

  Interest Rate Caps and Collars

    We enter into interest rate cap and collar agreements that lock in a maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow
our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from declines in market rates. At December 31, 2018, the total
U.S. dollar equivalents of the notional amounts of our interest rate caps and collars were $254.9 million and $649.9 million,
respectively.

  Equity-related Derivative Instruments

     ITV Collar and Secured Borrowing. The ITV Collar comprises (i) purchased put options exercisable by our company and (ii)
written call options exercisable by the counterparty. The ITV Collar effectively hedges the value of our investment in ITV shares
from losses due to market price decreases below the put option price while retaining a portion of the gains from market price
increases up to the call option price. The fair value of the ITV Collar as of December 31, 2018 was a net asset of $704.0 million.
The ITV Collar has settlement dates ranging from 2020 to 2022.

     The ITV Collar and related agreements also provide our company with the ability to borrow against the value of its ITV shares.
At December 31, 2018, borrowings under the ITV Collar Loan were secured by all 398,515,510 of our ITV shares, which have
been placed into a custody account. The ITV Collar Loan, which has maturity dates consistent with the ITV Collar and contains
no financial covenants, provides for customary representations and warranties, events of default and certain adjustment and
termination events. Under the terms of the ITV Collar, the counterparty has the right to re-use the pledged ITV shares held in the
custody account, but we have the right to recall the shares that are re-used by the counterparty subject to certain costs. In addition,
the counterparty retains dividends on the ITV shares that the counterparty would need to borrow from the custody account to hedge
its exposure under the ITV Collar (an estimated 400 million shares at December 31, 2018).

     Lionsgate Forward and Secured Borrowing. The Lionsgate Forward has economic characteristics similar to a collar plus a loan
that is collateralized by a pledge of 1.25 million of our voting and 1.25 million of our non-voting Lionsgate shares (the Lionsgate
Loan). Under the terms of the Lionsgate Forward, the counterparty does not have the right to re-use the pledged Lionsgate shares
without permission from Liberty Global. The Lionsgate Forward effectively hedges the value of our pledged Lionsgate shares from
losses due to market price decreases below the put option price while retaining a portion of the gains from market price increases
up to the call option price. The fair value of the Lionsgate Forward as of December 31, 2018 was a net asset of $42.2 million. The
Lionsgate Forward has settlement dates ranging from July 2019 through March 2022.

      For additional information regarding our investments in ITV and Lionsgate see note 7.

(9)       Fair Value Measurements

     We use the fair value method to account for (i) certain of our investments, (ii) our derivative instruments and (iii) certain
instruments that we classify as debt. The reported fair values of these investments and instruments as of December 31, 2018 are
unlikely to represent the value that will be paid or received upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of these assets and liabilities.

     U.S. GAAP provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting
entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability. We record transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during
which the transfer occurred. During 2018, no material transfers were made.

     All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures, swap rates and certain of the inputs for our weighted average cost of capital
calculations) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These
inputs, or interpolations or extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves,
forward interest and currency rates and weighted average cost of capital rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market
value assessments from the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal
valuations and investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values
of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our internal valuations.

     For our investments in publicly-traded companies, the recurring fair value measurements are based on the quoted closing price
of the respective shares at each reporting date. Accordingly, the valuations of these investments fall under Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy. Our other investments that we account for at fair value are privately-held companies, and therefore, quoted market prices
are unavailable. The valuation technique we use for such investments is a combination of an income approach (discounted cash
flow model based on forecasts) and a market approach (market multiples of similar businesses). With the exception of certain
inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used to value these
investments are based on unobservable inputs derived from our assumptions. Therefore, the valuation of our privately-held

                                                                 II-101

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


investments falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Any reasonably foreseeable changes in assumed levels of unobservable
inputs for the valuations of our Level 3 investments would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

     The recurring fair value measurement of our equity-related derivative instruments are based on standard option pricing models,
which require the input of observable and unobservable variables such as exchange-traded equity prices, risk-free interest rates,
dividend forecasts and forecasted volatilities of the underlying equity securities. The valuations of our equity-related derivative
instruments are based on a combination of Level 1 inputs (exchange-traded equity prices), Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures and
swap rates) and Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities). As changes in volatilities could have a significant impact on the overall
valuations over the terms of the derivative instruments, we have determined that these valuations fall under Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. At December 31, 2018, our equity-related derivatives were not significantly impacted by forecasted volatilities.

     In order to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk, we have entered into (i) various derivative instruments
and (ii) certain instruments that we classify as debt, as further described in notes 8 and 11, respectively. The recurring fair value
measurements of these instruments are determined using discounted cash flow models. With the exception of the inputs for certain
swaptions, most of the inputs to these discounted cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable Level 2 data for
substantially the full term of these instruments. This observable data mostly includes currency rates, interest rate futures and swap
rates, which are retrieved or derived from available market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we do not
otherwise alter this data in performing our valuations. We use a Monte Carlo based approach to incorporate a credit risk valuation
adjustment in our fair value measurements to estimate the impact of both our own nonperformance risk and the nonperformance
risk of our counterparties. The inputs used for our credit risk valuations, including our and our counterparties’ credit spreads,
represent our most significant Level 3 inputs, and these inputs are used to derive the credit risk valuation adjustments with respect
to these instruments. As we would not expect these parameters to have a significant impact on the valuations of these instruments,
we have determined that these valuations (other than the valuations of the aforementioned swaptions) fall under Level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy. Due to the lack of Level 2 inputs for the swaption valuations, we believe these valuations fall under Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps are
quantified and further explained in note 8.

     Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with acquisition
accounting and impairment assessments. The nonrecurring valuations associated with acquisition accounting primarily include
the valuation of reporting units, customer relationship and other intangible assets and property and equipment. Unless a reporting
unit has a readily determinable fair value, the valuation of reporting units is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses.
With the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculations that are derived from
pricing services, the inputs used in our discounted cash flow analyses, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our
assumptions. The valuation of customer relationships is primarily based on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a
discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the
customer relationship, considering such factors as estimated customer life, the revenue expected to be generated over the life of
the customer relationship, contributory asset charges and other factors. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement
or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment
and economic obsolescence. Most of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not perform significant nonrecurring fair value measurements during 2018 or 2017.

     If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory
or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future
periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other
long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


      or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, our weighted average interest rate
      on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness was 4.31% at December 31, 2018. For information regarding our
      derivative instruments, see note 8.

(b)   Unused borrowing capacity represents the maximum availability under the applicable facility at December 31, 2018 without
      regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. At December 31, 2018, based on
      the most restrictive applicable leverage covenants, the full amount of unused borrowing capacity was available to be borrowed
      under each of the respective subsidiary facilities, and based on the most restrictive applicable leverage-based restricted
      payment tests, there were no restrictions on the respective subsidiary's ability to make loans or distributions from this
      availability to Liberty Global or its subsidiaries or other equity holders. Upon completion of the relevant December 31,
      2018 compliance reporting requirements, we expect that the full amount of unused borrowing capacity will continue to be
      available and that there will be no restrictions with respect to loans or distributions. Our above expectations do not consider
      any actual or potential changes to our borrowing levels or any amounts loaned or distributed subsequent to December 31,
      2018.

(c)   Amounts include £41.9 million ($53.4 million) and £43.6 million ($55.6 million) at December 31, 2018 and 2017,
      respectively, of borrowings pursuant to excess cash facilities under the VM Credit Facilities. These borrowings are owed
      to certain non-consolidated special purpose financing entities that have issued notes to finance the purchase of receivables
      due from Virgin Media to certain other third parties for amounts that Virgin Media and its subsidiaries have vendor financed.
      To the extent that the proceeds from these notes exceed the amount of vendor financed receivables available to be purchased,
      the excess proceeds are used to fund these excess cash facilities.

(d)   Unused borrowing capacity under the VM Credit Facilities relates to multi-currency revolving facilities with an aggregate
      maximum borrowing capacity equivalent to £675.0 million ($860.3 million). During 2018, the VM Revolving Facility was
      amended and split into two revolving facilities. As of December 31, 2018, VM Revolving Facility A was a multi-currency
      revolving facility maturing on December 31, 2021 with a maximum borrowing capacity equivalent to £50.0 million ($63.7
      million), and VM Revolving Facility B was a multi-currency revolving facility maturing on January 15, 2024 with a maximum
      borrowing capacity equivalent to £625.0 million ($796.6 million). All other terms from the previously existing VM Revolving
      Facility continue to apply to the new revolving facilities.

(e)   Unused borrowing capacity under the Telenet Credit Facility comprises (i) €400.0 million ($458.1 million) under Telenet
      Facility AG, (ii) €25.0 million ($28.6 million) under the Telenet Overdraft Facility and (iii) €20.0 million ($22.9 million)
      under the Telenet Revolving Facility, each of which were undrawn at December 31, 2018.

(f)   Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our operations in Switzerland. For information
      regarding the potential impact on the outstanding debt of the UPC Holding borrowing group, see note 21.

(g)   Represents amounts owed pursuant to interest-bearing vendor financing arrangements that are used to finance certain of
      our property and equipment additions and, to a lesser extent, certain of our operating expenses. These obligations are
      generally due within one year and include VAT that was paid on our behalf by the vendor. Repayments of vendor financing
      obligations are included in repayments and repurchases of debt and capital lease obligations in our consolidated statements
      of cash flows.

(h)   Represents amounts associated with certain derivative-related borrowing instruments, including $248.6 million and $304.9
      million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, carried at fair value. These instruments mature at various dates through
      January 2025. For information regarding fair value hierarchies, see note 9.

(i)   In August 2018, we settled the outstanding amount under the Sumitomo Share Loan with the remaining shares of Sumitomo
      that were held by our company.

(j)   Amounts include $225.9 million and $160.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of debt collateralized
      by certain trade receivables of Virgin Media.

(k)   As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our debt had an estimated fair value of $28.5 billion and $32.7 billion, respectively.
      The estimated fair values of our debt instruments are generally determined using the average of applicable bid and ask prices

                                                              II-109

          (mostly Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy) or, when quoted market prices are unavailable or not considered indicative of
          fair value, discounted cash flow models (mostly Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The discount rates used in the cash
          flow models are based on the market interest rates and estimated credit spreads of the applicable entity, to the extent available,
          and other relevant factors. For additional information regarding fair value hierarchies, see note 9.

          _______________

          (1)      At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Telenet’s capital lease obligations included €390.6 million ($447.3 million) and
                   €361.8 million ($414.3 million), respectively, associated with Telenet’s lease of the broadband communications
                   network of the four associations of municipalities in Belgium, which we refer to as the pure intercommunalues or
                   the “PICs.” All capital expenditures associated with the PICs network are initiated by Telenet, but are executed and
                   financed by the PICs through additions to this lease that are repaid over a 15-year term. These amounts do not include
                   Telenet’s commitment related to certain operating costs associated with the PICs network. For additional information
                   regarding this commitment, see note 18.

  General Information

    At December 31, 2018, most of our outstanding debt had been incurred by one of our three subsidiary “borrowing groups.”
References to these borrowing groups, which comprise Virgin Media, UPC Holding and Telenet, include their respective restricted
parent and subsidiary entities.

     Credit Facilities. Each of our borrowing groups has entered into one or more credit facility agreements with certain financial
institutions. Each of these credit facilities contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

      •     Our credit facilities contain certain consolidated net leverage ratios, as specified in the relevant credit facility, which are
            required to be complied with (i) on an incurrence basis and/or (ii) when the associated revolving credit facilities have
            been drawn beyond a specified percentage of the total available revolving credit commitments, on a maintenance basis;

      •     Subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions, our credit facilities contain certain restrictions which, among other
            things, restrict the ability of the members of the relevant borrowing group to, (i) incur or guarantee certain financial
            indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets and (iv)
            make certain restricted payments to their direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to Liberty Global) through
            dividends, loans or other distributions;

      •     Our credit facilities require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums
            payable under the relevant credit facility and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their
            shares or, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable
            thereunder;

      •     In addition to certain mandatory prepayment events, our credit facilities provide that the instructing group of lenders
            under the relevant credit facility, under certain circumstances, may cancel the group’s commitments thereunder and declare


                                                                                            II-110
                                                  LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC
                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


         the loan(s) thereunder due and payable after the applicable notice period following the occurrence of a change of control
         (as specified in the relevant credit facility);

    •    Our credit facilities contain certain customary events of default, the occurrence of which, subject to certain exceptions,
         materiality qualifications and cure rights, would allow the instructing group of lenders to (i) cancel the total commitments,
         (ii) declare that all or part of the loans be payable on demand and/or (iii) accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate
         their commitments thereunder;

    •    Our credit facilities require members of the relevant borrowing group to observe certain affirmative and negative
         undertakings and covenants, which are subject to certain materiality qualifications and other customary and agreed
         exceptions; and

    •    In addition to customary default provisions, our credit facilities generally include certain cross-default and cross-
         acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness of members of the relevant borrowing group, subject to agreed
         minimum thresholds and other customary and agreed exceptions.

     Senior and Senior Secured Notes. Certain of our borrowing groups have issued senior and/or senior secured notes. In general,
our senior and senior secured notes (i) are senior obligations of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group that
rank equally with all of the existing and future senior debt of such issuer and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt
of such issuer within the relevant borrowing group, (ii) contain, in most instances, certain guarantees from other members of the
relevant borrowing group (as specified in the applicable indenture) and (iii) with respect to our senior secured notes, are secured
by certain pledges or liens over the assets and/or shares of certain members of the relevant borrowing group. In addition, the
indentures governing our senior and senior secured notes contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

    •    Our notes contain certain customary incurrence-based covenants. In addition, our notes provide that any failure to pay
         principal prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period, or any acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of
         the issuer or certain subsidiaries over agreed minimum thresholds (as specified under the applicable indenture), is an
         event of default under the respective notes;

    •    Subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions, our notes contain certain restrictions that, among other things, restrict
         the ability of the members of the relevant borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii)
         make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets and (iv) make certain
         restricted payments to its direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to Liberty Global) through dividends,
         loans or other distributions;

    •    If the relevant issuer or certain of its subsidiaries (as specified in the applicable indenture) sell certain assets, such issuer
         must, subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions, offer to repurchase the applicable notes at par, or if a change
         of control (as specified in the applicable indenture) occurs, such issuer must offer to repurchase all of the relevant notes
         at a redemption price of 101%;

    •    Our senior secured notes contain certain early redemption provisions including, for certain senior secured notes, the ability
         to, during each 12-month period commencing on the issue date for such notes until the applicable call date, redeem up
         to 10% of the principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes to
         be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest; and

    •    Certain of our notes are non-callable. The remainder of our notes are non-callable prior to their respective call date (as
         specified under the applicable indenture). At any time prior to the applicable call date, we may redeem some or all of the
         applicable notes by paying a “make-whole” premium, which is the present value of all remaining scheduled interest
         payments to the applicable call date using the discount rate as of the redemption date plus a premium (as specified in the
         applicable indenture). After the applicable call date, we may redeem some or all of these notes at various redemption
         prices plus accrued interest and additional amounts (as specified in the applicable indenture), if any, to the applicable
         redemption date.




                                                                 II-111

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


     SPE Notes. From time to time, we create special purpose financing entities (SPEs), most of which are 100% owned by third
parties, for the primary purpose of facilitating the offering of senior and senior secured notes, which we collectively refer to as the
“SPE Notes.”

     The SPEs used the proceeds from the issuance of SPE Notes to fund term loan facilities under the credit facilities made
available to their respective borrowing group (as further described below), each a “Funded Facility” and collectively the “Funded
Facilities.” Each SPE is dependent on payments from the relevant borrowing entity under the applicable Funded Facility in order
to service its payment obligations under each respective SPE Note. Each of the Funded Facility term loans creates a variable
interest in the respective SPE for which the relevant borrowing entity is the primary beneficiary and are consolidated by the relevant
parent entities, including Liberty Global. As a result, the amounts outstanding under the Funded Facilities are eliminated in the
respective borrowing group’s and Liberty Global’s consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding
SPE Notes issued by entities consolidated by (i) UPC Holding, collectively the “UPCB SPEs” and (ii) Telenet, collectively the
“Telenet SPEs”.

     Pursuant to the respective indentures for the SPE Notes (the SPE Indentures) and the respective accession agreements for
the Funded Facilities, the call provisions, maturity and applicable interest rate for each Funded Facility are the same as those of
the related SPE Notes. The SPEs, as lenders under the relevant Funded Facility for the relevant borrowing group, are treated the
same as the other lenders under the respective credit facility, with benefits, rights and protections similar to those afforded to the
other lenders. Through the covenants in the applicable SPE Indentures and the applicable security interests over (i) all of the issued
shares of the relevant SPE and (ii) the relevant SPE’s rights under the applicable Funded Facility granted to secure the relevant
SPE’s obligations under the relevant SPE Notes, the holders of the SPE Notes are provided indirectly with the benefits, rights,
protections and covenants granted to the SPEs as lenders under the applicable Funded Facility. The SPEs are prohibited from
incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions under the SPE Indentures.

     The SPE Notes are non-callable prior to their respective call date (as specified under the applicable SPE Indenture). If, however,
at any time prior to the applicable SPE Notes call date, all or a portion of the loans under the related Funded Facility are voluntarily
prepaid (a SPE Early Redemption Event), then the SPE will be required to redeem an aggregate principal amount of its respective
SPE Notes equal to the aggregate principal amount of the loans prepaid under the relevant Funded Facility. In general, the redemption
price payable will equal 100% of the principal amount of the applicable SPE Notes to be redeemed and a “make-whole” premium,
which is the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments to the applicable SPE Notes call date using the discount
rate (as specified in the applicable SPE Indenture) as of the redemption date plus a premium (as specified in the applicable SPE
Indenture).

     Upon the occurrence of a SPE Early Redemption Event on or after the applicable SPE Notes call date, the SPE will redeem
an aggregate principal amount of its respective SPE Notes equal to the principal amount of the related Funded Facility prepaid at
a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts
(as specified in the applicable SPE Indenture), if any, to the applicable redemption date.

  Virgin Media - 2018 Financing Transactions

     In August 2018, Virgin Media redeemed (i) $190.0 million of the $530.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.375%
2023 VM Dollar Senior Notes and (ii) in full the £250.0 million ($318.6 million) outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% 2023
VM Sterling Senior Notes. These transactions were funded with a portion of the proceeds received by another Liberty Global
subsidiary in connection with the sale of UPC Austria, as described in note 6. In October 2018, we used existing cash to redeem
in full the $340.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.375% 2023 VM Dollar Senior Notes. In connection with these
transactions, Virgin Media recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of $36.4 million related to (a) the payment
of $28.2 million of redemption premiums and (b) the write-off of $8.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts.

turn, UPCB Finance IV used such proceeds to redeem €60.0 million of the €600.0 million outstanding principal amount of the
UPCB Finance IV Euro Notes, whose terms are consistent with UPC Facility AK. These transactions were funded with a portion
of the proceeds received by another Liberty Global subsidiary in connection with the sale of UPC Austria, as described in note 6.
In connection with these transactions, UPC Holding recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of $8.9 million
related to (a) the write-off of $6.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts and (b) the payment of $2.0
million of redemption premiums.

  Telenet - 2018 Financing Transactions

     In March 2018, Telenet used existing cash to prepay 10% of the €530.0 million ($607.0 million) outstanding principal amount
under Telenet Facility AB, which matures on July 15, 2027 and bears interest at a rate of 4.875%, together with accrued and unpaid
interest and the related prepayment premiums, which was owed to Telenet Finance VI and, in turn, Telenet Finance VI used such
proceeds to redeem 10% of the €530.0 million outstanding principal amount of the Telenet Finance VI Notes, whose terms are
consistent with Telenet Facility AB. In connection with this transaction, Telenet recognized a loss on debt modification and
extinguishment of $2.6 million related to (i) the payment of $2.0 million of redemption premiums and (ii) the write-off of $0.6
million of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts.

     In March 2018, commitments under Telenet Facility AL, which matures on March 1, 2026, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR
+ 2.50% and is subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.0%, were increased by $300.0 million (the Telenet Facility AL Add-on) with terms
consistent to those of Telenet Facility AL. In April 2018, Telenet drew the full $300.0 million of the Telenet Facility AL Add-on

(a)     The statutory or “expected” tax rates are the U.K. rates of 19% for 2018, 19.25% for 2017 and 20.00% for 2016. The 2017
        statutory rate represents the blended rate that was in effect for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the 20.0%
        statutory rate that was in effect for the first quarter of 2017 and the 19.0% statutory rate that was in effect for the remainder
        of 2017.

(b)     As further discussed below, the liability we have recorded for the Mandatory Repatriation Tax (as defined and described
        below) is significantly lower than the amount included in our income tax expense due in part to the expected use of
        carryforward attributes in the U.S., all of which were subject to valuation allowances prior to the initial recognition of the
        Mandatory Repatriation Tax during the first quarter of 2018.

(c)     These amounts reflect the net impact of differences in the treatment of income and loss items between financial reporting
        and tax accounting related to investments in subsidiaries and affiliates including the effects of foreign earnings.

(d)     On December 18, 2018, reductions in the corporate income tax rate in the Netherlands were enacted. The rate will be reduced
        from the current rate of 25.0% to 22.5% in 2020 and 20.5% in 2021. Substantially all of the impacts of these rate changes
        in the Netherlands on our deferred tax balances were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2017, a Belgian income
        tax rate reduction was signed into law. The Belgian statutory tax rate decreased from 33.9% to 29.58% beginning in 2018,
        and in 2020, this rate will further decrease to 25.0%. Also in 2017, the U.S. corporate income tax rate was reduced from
        35.0% to 21.0% effective beginning in 2018. Substantially all of the impacts of the tax rate changes in Belgium and the
        U.S. on our deferred tax balances were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, the
        U.K. enacted legislation that will reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 to 17.0%. Substantially all of the impact
        of this rate change on our deferred tax balances was recorded during the third quarter of 2016.

(e)     Amounts reflect adjustments (either a benefit or expense) to the “expected” tax benefit (expense) for statutory rates in
        jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the U.K.

     Our deferred income tax valuation allowance decreased $150.0 million in 2018. This decrease reflects the net effect of (i)
foreign currency translation adjustments, (ii) decreases associated with reductions in deferred tax assets, (iii) the effect of enacted
tax law and rate changes, (iv) the net tax expense of $34.9 million and (v) other individually insignificant items.

     Virgin Media had property and equipment on which future U.K. tax deductions can be claimed of $18.1 billion and $19.4
billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The maximum amount of these “capital allowances” that can be claimed in
any one year is 18% of the remaining balance, after additions, disposals and prior claims. The tax effects of the excess of these
capital allowances over the related financial reporting bases are included in the 2018 and 2017 deferred tax assets related to property
and equipment, net, in the above table.

     Our tax loss carryforwards within each jurisdiction combine all companies’ tax losses (both capital and ordinary losses) in
that jurisdiction, however, certain tax jurisdictions limit the ability to offset taxable income of a separate company or different tax
group with the tax losses associated with another separate company or group. Further, tax jurisdictions restrict the type of taxable
income that the above losses are able to offset. The majority of the tax losses shown in the above table are not expected to be
realized, including certain losses that are limited in use due to change in control or same business tests.

     We have taxable outside basis differences on certain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. For this purpose, the outside basis
difference is any difference between the aggregate tax basis in the equity of a consolidated subsidiary and the corresponding amount
of the subsidiary’s net equity, including cumulative translation adjustments, as determined for financial reporting purposes. This
outside basis difference does not include unremitted earnings. At December 31, 2018, we have not provided deferred tax liabilities
on an estimated $5.9 billion of cumulative temporary differences on the outside bases of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

     Through our subsidiaries, we maintain a presence in many countries. Many of these countries maintain highly complex tax
regimes that differ significantly from the system of income taxation used in the U.K. and the U.S. We have accounted for the effect
of these taxes based on what we believe is reasonably expected to apply to us and our subsidiaries based on tax laws currently in
effect and reasonable interpretations of these laws.

     The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 U.S. Tax Act) was signed into U.S. law on December 22, 2017. Significant changes to
the U.S. income tax regime include the imposition of taxes on a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of earnings and profits
of foreign corporations (the Mandatory Repatriation Tax) and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (the GILTI
Tax).

     The Mandatory Repatriation Tax requires that the aggregate post-1986 earnings and profits of our foreign corporations be
included in our U.S. taxable income. The one-time repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits is then taxed at a rate
of 15.5% for cash earnings and 8% for non-cash earnings, both as defined in the 2017 U.S. Tax Act, and is payable, interest free,
over an eight year period according to a prescribed payment schedule with 45% of the tax due in the last two years. At December 31,
2018, we have recorded a liability for the Mandatory Repatriation Tax of $293.3 million after considering the expected use of
carryforward tax attributes and other filing positions.

     The GILTI Tax will require our U.S. subsidiaries that are shareholders in foreign corporations to include in their taxable income
for each year beginning after December 31, 2018, their pro rata share of global intangible low-taxed income. The GILTI Tax is
calculated as the excess of the net foreign corporation income over a deemed return. The GILTI Tax is reported as a period cost
when it is incurred.

    We and our subsidiaries file consolidated and standalone income tax returns in various jurisdictions. In the normal course of
business, our income tax filings are subject to review by various taxing authorities. In connection with such reviews, disputes
could arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain income tax rules related to our business in

                                                                                           II-120

that tax jurisdiction. Such disputes may result in future tax and interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities. The
ultimate resolution of tax contingencies will take place upon the earlier of (i) the settlement date with the applicable taxing authorities
in either cash or agreement of income tax positions or (ii) the date when the tax authorities are statutorily prohibited from adjusting
the company’s tax computations.

     In general, tax returns filed by our company or our subsidiaries for years prior to 2009 are no longer subject to examination
by tax authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently involved in income tax examinations in various jurisdictions in which
we operate, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and the U.S. Except as noted below, any adjustments that might arise from the
foregoing examinations are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In the U.S., we have received notices of adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to our 2010 and 2009 income
tax returns, and have entered into the appeals process with respect to the 2010 and 2009 matters. While we believe that the ultimate
resolution of these proposed adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows, no assurance can be given that this will be the case given the amounts involved and the complex nature of the related
issues.

     The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits are summarized below:

     No assurance can be given that any of these tax benefits will be recognized or realized.

    As of December 31, 2018, our unrecognized tax benefits included $759.8 million of tax benefits that would have a favorable
impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by
valuation allowances and other factors.

     During 2019, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of ongoing examinations by tax authorities, as well as expiration of
statutes of limitation, could result in reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken as of December 31,
2018. The amount of any such reductions could range up to $225 million, all of which would have a positive impact on our effective
tax rate. Other than the potential impacts of these ongoing examinations and the expected expiration of certain statutes of limitation,
we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2019. No assurance can be given as to the nature
or impact of any changes in our unrecognized tax positions during 2019.

    During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the income tax benefit (expense) of our continuing operations includes net income tax benefit
(expense) of ($58.9 million), ($5.5 million) and $30.9 million, respectively, representing the net benefit (accrual) of interest and
penalties during the period. Our other long-term liabilities include accrued interest and penalties of $94.0 million at December 31,
2018.

(13)        Equity

  Capitalization

     At December 31, 2018, our authorized share capital consisted of an aggregate nominal amount of $20.0 million, consisting
of any of the following: (i) ordinary shares (Class A, B or C), each with a nominal value of $0.01 per share, (ii) preference shares,
with a nominal value to be determined by the board of directors, the issuance of one or more classes or series of which may be
authorized by the board of directors, and (iii) any other shares of one or more classes as may be determined by the board of directors
or by the shareholders of Liberty Global. For the period beginning July 1, 2015 through the December 29, 2017 completion of the
Split-off Transaction, our share capital included (a) our Class A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively
referred to herein as “Liberty Global Shares”) and (b) our LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares (collectively
referred to herein as “LiLAC Shares”). The LiLAC Shares were tracking shares intended to track the economic performance of
the LiLAC Group. Pursuant to the Split-off Transaction, the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (which had
virtually no economic rights), transferred to a third party and cancelled.

     Under Liberty Global’s Articles of Association, effective July 1, 2015, holders of Liberty Global Class A ordinary shares are
entitled to one vote for each such share held, and holders of Liberty Global Class B ordinary shares are entitled to 10 votes for
each such share held, on all matters submitted to a vote of Liberty Global shareholders at any general meeting (annual or special).
Holders of Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares are not entitled to any voting powers except as required by law.

     At the option of the holder, each Liberty Global Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Liberty Global Class A ordinary
share. One Liberty Global Class A ordinary share is reserved for issuance for each Liberty Global Class B ordinary share that is
issued (11,099,593 shares issued as of December 31, 2018). Additionally, at December 31, 2018, we have reserved the following
ordinary shares for the issuance of outstanding share-based compensation awards:

                                                                                                                                                  Class A (a)         Class C (a)

(a)      Includes share-based compensation awards held by former employees of Liberty Global that became employees of Liberty
         Latin America as a result of the Split-off Transaction. For additional information, see note 14.

     Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding class of our preference shares, the holders of our ordinary shares are
entitled to dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors from funds available therefore. Except with
respect to share distributions, whenever a dividend is paid in cash to the holder of one class of our ordinary shares, we shall also
pay to the holders of the other classes of our ordinary shares an equal per share dividend. There are currently no contractual
restrictions on our ability to pay dividends in cash or shares.

     In the event of our liquidation, dissolution and winding up, after payment or provision for payment of our debts and liabilities
and subject to the prior payment in full of any preferential amounts to which our preference shareholders, if any, may be entitled,
the holders of our ordinary shares will be entitled to receive their proportionate interests, expressed in liquidation units, in any
assets available for distribution to our ordinary shares.

        see note 6.

  Share Repurchase Programs

     As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our “Distributable
Reserves.” Distributable Reserves, which are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount, may be created through the earnings
of the U.K. parent company and, among other methods, through a reduction in share premium approved by the English Companies
Court. Based on the amounts set forth in our 2017 U.K. Companies Act Report dated May 1, 2018, which are our most recent
“Relevant Accounts” for the purposes of determining our Distributable Reserves under U.K. law, our Distributable Reserves were
$22.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. This amount does not reflect earnings, share repurchases or other activity that occurred in
2018, each of which impacts the amount of our Distributable Reserves.

     Our board of directors has approved share repurchase programs for our Liberty Global Shares. In addition, from November
2016 through the completion of the Split-off Transaction, we were authorized to repurchase our LiLAC Shares. Under these plans,
we receive authorization to acquire up to the specified amount (before direct acquisition costs) of Class A and Class C Liberty
Global Shares or LiLAC Shares, or other authorized securities, from time to time through open market or privately negotiated
transactions, which may include derivative transactions. The timing of the repurchase of shares or other securities pursuant to our
equity repurchase programs, which may be suspended or discontinued at any time, is dependent on a variety of factors, including
market conditions. In July 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $500.0 million of share repurchases through July
2019. At December 31, 2018, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was $566.2 million.

(a)     Includes direct acquisition costs, where applicable.

  Subsidiary Distributions

     From time to time, Telenet and certain other of our subsidiaries make cash distributions to their respective shareholders. Our
share of these distributions is eliminated in consolidation and the noncontrolling interest owners’ share of these distributions is
reflected as a charge against noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of equity. In this regard, in August 2018,
Telenet declared a €600.0 million dividend to its shareholders. Our share of this dividend, which was financed with additional
borrowings under the Telenet Credit Facility and paid on October 4, 2018, was €351.6 million ($404.8 million at the payment
date).

  Restricted Net Assets

     The ability of certain of our subsidiaries to distribute or loan all or a portion of their net assets to our company is limited by
the terms of applicable debt facilities. At December 31, 2018, substantially all of our net assets represented net assets of our
subsidiaries that were subject to such limitations.

(a)      Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i) PSUs, (ii) in 2016, a challenge performance award plan for certain
         executive officers and key employees (the Challenge Performance Awards) and (iii) through March 2017, the PGUs held
         by our Chief Executive Officer. The Challenge Performance Awards included PSARs and PSUs.

(b)      Represents annual incentive compensation and defined contribution plan liabilities that have been or are expected to be
         settled with Liberty Global ordinary shares. In the case of the annual incentive compensation, shares will be issued to senior
         management and key employees pursuant to a shareholding incentive program that was implemented in the fourth quarter
         of 2017. The shareholding incentive program allows these employees to elect to receive up to 100% of their annual incentive
         compensation in ordinary shares of Liberty Global in lieu of cash.

(c)      Represents the share-based compensation expense associated with Telenet’s share-based incentive awards, which, at
         December 31, 2018, included performance- and non-performance-based stock option awards with respect to 4,494,002
         Telenet shares. These stock option awards had a weighted average exercise price of €42.50 ($48.67).

   As of December 31, 2018, $246.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our Liberty Global share-based

  Performance Awards

    The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions with respect to our performance-based awards for certain
executive officers and key employees.

    Liberty Global PSUs

    In March 2015, our compensation committee approved the grant of PSUs to executive officers and key employees (the 2015
PSUs). The performance plan for the 2015 PSUs covered a two-year period that ended on December 31, 2016 and included a
performance target based on the achievement of a specified compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in a consolidated Adjusted
OIBDA metric (as defined in note 19). The performance target was adjusted for events such as acquisitions, dispositions and
changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect comparability (Adjusted OIBDA CAGR), and the participant’s annual
performance ratings during the two-year performance period. Participants earned 99.5% of their targeted awards under the 2015
PSUs, which vested 50% on each of April 1 and October 1 of 2017.

     In February 2016, our compensation committee approved the grant of PSUs to executive officers and key employees (the
2016 PSUs) pursuant to a performance plan that is based on the achievement of a specified Adjusted OIBDA CAGR during the
three-year period ending December 31, 2018. The 2016 PSUs, as adjusted through the 2017 Award Modification, require delivery
of compound annual growth rates of consolidated Adjusted OIBDA CAGR of 6.0% during the three-year performance period for
Liberty Global or Liberty Latin America depending on the respective class of shares underlying the award, with over- and under-
performance payout opportunities should the Adjusted OIBDA CAGR exceed or fail to meet the target, as applicable. The
performance payout may be adjusted at the compensation committee’s discretion for events that may affect comparability, such
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and accounting principles or policies. The 2016 PSUs will vest 50% on each of
April 1, 2019 and October 1, 2019.

    During 2018, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the grant of PSUs to executive officers and key
employees (the 2018 PSUs) pursuant to a performance plan that is based on the achievement of a specified Adjusted OIBDA
CAGR during the two-year period ending December 31, 2019. The 2018 PSUs include over- and under-performance payout
opportunities should the Adjusted OIBDA CAGR exceed or fail to meet the target, as applicable. A performance range of 50% to
125% of the target Adjusted OIBDA CAGR will generally result in award recipients earning 50% to 150% of their target 2018
PSUs, subject to reduction or forfeiture based on individual performance. The earned 2018 PSUs will vest 50% on April 1, 2020
and 50% on October 1, 2020. The target Adjusted OIBDA CAGR for the 2018 PSUs was determined on October 26, 2018 and,
accordingly, associated compensation expense has been recognized prospectively from that date.

    Liberty Global Performance Grant Award

     Effective April 30, 2014, our compensation committee authorized the grant of PGUs to our Chief Executive Officer, comprising
a total of one million PGUs with respect to our then outstanding Liberty Global Class A ordinary shares and one million PGUs
with respect to our then outstanding Liberty Global Class B ordinary shares. The PGUs, which were subject to a performance
condition that was achieved in 2014, vested in three equal annual installments beginning on March 15, 2015. Our Chief Executive
Officer also received 41,589 PGUs with respect to each Class A and Class B LiLAC Shares as a result of the LiLAC Distribution
in 2016 and 33,333 PGUs with respect to each Class A and Class B LiLAC Shares as a result of the impact of the July 1, 2015
distribution of LiLAC Shares in 2015. As of March 31, 2017, all PGUs were fully vested.

    Liberty Global Challenge Performance Awards

     Effective June 24, 2013, our compensation committee approved the Challenge Performance Awards, which consisted solely
of PSARs for our senior executive officers and a combination of PSARs and PSUs for our other executive officers and key
employees. Each PSU represented the right to receive one Liberty Global or LiLAC Class A or Class C ordinary share, as
applicable. The performance criteria for the Challenge Performance Awards was based on the participant’s performance and
achievement of individual goals in each of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. As a result of satisfying performance conditions, 100%
of the then outstanding Challenge Performance Awards vested and became fully exercisable on June 24, 2016. The PSARs have
a term of seven years and base prices equal to the respective market closing prices of the applicable class on the grant date.

     Our restructuring charges during 2018 included (i) $40.5 million of costs in Belgium attributed to the migration of Telenet’s
mobile subscribers from an MVNO arrangement to Telenet’s mobile network and (ii) employee severance and termination costs
related to certain reorganization and integration activities of $23.7 million in U.K./Ireland and $14.2 million in Central and

its mobile subscribers from an MVNO arrangement to the BASE mobile network. In March 2018, Telenet completed this migration
and recorded the costs associated with meeting its minimum guarantee commitment under the MVNO agreement as a restructuring
charge. Telenet’s MVNO agreement expired at the end of 2018.

(18)      Commitments and Contingencies

  Commitments

     In the normal course of business, we have entered into agreements that commit our company to make cash payments in future
periods with respect to network and connectivity commitments, programming contracts, purchases of customer premises and other
equipment and services, non-cancellable operating leases and other items. The following table sets forth the U.S. dollar equivalents
of such commitments as of December 31, 2018. The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are
included in our December 31, 2018 consolidated balance sheet.
                                                                                  Payments due during:
                                                      2019             2020        2021         2022           2023     Thereafter     Total
                                                                                             in millions


Network and connectivity
  commitments................................. $ 629.4             $    282.1    $     243.6   $    60.3   $     44.1   $   776.4    $ 2,035.9
Programming commitments .............                      858.0        558.7          286.2        52.1         14.2        44.9      1,814.1
Purchase commitments.....................                  742.8       243.9            88.5        31.9         20.4        45.5      1,173.0
Operating leases ...............................           123.9        85.4            66.6        54.3         46.8       178.6        555.6
Other commitments ..........................                27.0         3.2             0.5         0.3           —           —          31.0
   Total ............................................. $ 2,381.1   $ 1,173.3     $     685.4   $   198.9   $    125.5   $ 1,045.4    $ 5,609.6

     Network and connectivity commitments include (i) Telenet’s commitments for certain operating costs associated with its
leased network, (ii) commitments associated with our MVNO agreements, primarily in the U.K., and (iii) service commitments
associated with our network extension projects, primarily in the U.K. Telenet’s commitments for certain operating costs are subject
to adjustment based on changes in the network operating costs incurred by Telenet with respect to its own networks. These potential
adjustments are not subject to reasonable estimation and, therefore, are not included in the above table. The amounts reflected in
the above table with respect to certain of our MVNO commitments represent fixed minimum amounts payable under these
agreements and, therefore, may be significantly less than the actual amounts we ultimately pay in these periods.

     Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming, studio output and sports rights
contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual
number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose
of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. Programming commitments
do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not fixed.
Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we
expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented a significant
portion of our operating costs, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods. In this regard, our total
programming and copyright costs aggregated $1,671.4 million, $1,470.2 million and $1,783.4 million during 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively.

    Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) the purchase of customer premises
and other equipment and (ii) certain service-related commitments, including call center, information technology and maintenance
services.

     In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments
and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For
information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments
during 2018, 2017 and 2016, see note 8. For information regarding our defined benefit plans, see note 16.

     We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities and municipalities,
which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts or to upgrade, rebuild or extend
portions of our broadband communication systems. Such amounts are not included in the above table because they are not fixed
or determinable.

                                                                              II-135

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016



     Rental expense under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements amounted to $111.8 million, $104.5 million and $125.7
million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is expected that in the normal course of business, operating leases that expire
generally will be renewed or replaced by similar leases.

    We have established various defined contribution benefit plans for our and our subsidiaries’ employees. Our aggregate expense
for matching contributions under the various defined contribution employee benefit plans was $41.0 million, $34.7 million and
$67.6 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

  Guarantees and Other Credit Enhancements

     In the ordinary course of business, we may provide (i) indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain other parties
and (ii) performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors. Historically, these arrangements
have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments
in the future.

  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies

     Interkabel Acquisition. On November 26, 2007, Telenet and the PICs announced a non-binding agreement-in-principle to
transfer the analog and digital television activities of the PICs, including all existing subscribers, to Telenet. Subsequently, Telenet
and the PICs entered into a binding agreement (the 2008 PICs Agreement), which closed effective October 1, 2008. Beginning
in December 2007, Proximus NV/SA (Proximus), the incumbent telecommunications operator in Belgium, instituted several
proceedings seeking to block implementation of these agreements. Proximus lodged summary proceedings with the President of
the Court of First Instance of Antwerp to obtain a provisional injunction preventing the PICs from effecting the agreement-in-
principle and initiated a civil procedure on the merits claiming the annulment of the agreement-in-principle. In March 2008, the
President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of Proximus in the summary proceedings, which ruling was
overturned by the Court of Appeal of Antwerp in June 2008. Proximus brought this appeal judgment before the Cour de Cassation
(the Belgian Supreme Court), which confirmed the appeal judgment in September 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Court of First
Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of the PICs and Telenet in the civil procedure on the merits, dismissing Proximus’s request for
the rescission of the agreement-in-principle and the 2008 PICs Agreement. On June 12, 2009, Proximus appealed this judgment
with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. In this appeal, Proximus is now also seeking compensation for damages. While these
proceedings were suspended indefinitely, other proceedings were initiated, which resulted in a ruling by the Belgian Council of
State in May 2014 annulling (i) the decision of the PICs not to organize a public market consultation and (ii) the decision from
the PICs’ board of directors to approve the 2008 PICs Agreement. In December 2015, Proximus resumed the civil proceedings
pending with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp seeking to have the 2008 PICs Agreement annulled and claiming damages of €1.4
billion ($1.6 billion).

     In December 2017, the Court of Appeals of Antwerp issued a judgment rejecting Proximus’ claims. Proximus has the right
to appeal the Court of Appeals of Antwerp’s judgment with the Belgian Supreme Court, however Proximus has not done so to
date. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these or other proceedings. However, an unfavorable outcome of existing
or future proceedings could potentially lead to the annulment of the 2008 PICs Agreement and/or to an obligation of Telenet to
pay compensation for damages, subject to the relevant provisions of the 2008 PICs Agreement, which stipulate that Telenet is
responsible for damages in excess of €20.0 million ($22.9 million). We do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have
a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. No amounts have been accrued by us with respect
to this matter as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable.

     Telekom Deutschland Litigation. On December 28, 2012, Unitymedia filed a lawsuit against Telekom Deutschland GmbH
(Telekom Deutschland) in which Unitymedia asserts that it pays excessive prices for the co-use of Telekom Deutschland’s cable
ducts in Unitymedia’s footprint. The Federal Network Agency approved rates for the co-use of certain ducts of Telekom Deutschland
in March 2011. Based in part on these approved rates, Unitymedia sought a reduction of the annual lease fees (approximately €75
million ($86 million) for 2018) by approximately five-sixths. In addition, Unitymedia is seeking the return of similarly calculated
overpayments from 2009 through the ultimate settlement date, plus accrued interest. In October 2016, the first instance court
dismissed this action, and in March 2018, the court of appeal dismissed Unitymedia’s appeal of the first instance court’s decision
and did not grant permission to appeal further to the Federal Court of Justice. Unitymedia has filed a motion with the Federal
Court of Justice to grant permission to appeal. The resolution of this matter may take several years and no assurance can be given

                                                                II-136

                                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                              December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


that Unitymedia’s claims will be successful. Any recovery by Unitymedia will not be reflected in our consolidated financial
statements until such time as the final disposition of this matter has been reached. If this matter is settled subsequent to the
completion of the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group, we would only share in 50% of any amounts recovered, plus 50% of the
net present value of certain cost savings in future periods that are attributable to the favorable resolution of this matter, less 50%
of associated legal or other third-party fees paid post-completion of the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group.

     Belgium Regulatory Developments. In June 2018, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicatie and the regional
regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) adopted a new decision finding that Telenet has
significant market power in the wholesale broadband market (the 2018 Decision). The 2018 Decision imposes on Telenet the
obligations to (i) provide third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and
analog video) and (ii) make available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access (including fixed-line
telephony as an option). Unlike prior decisions, the 2018 Decision no longer applies “retail minus” pricing on Telenet; however,
as of August 1, 2018, this decision imposes a 17% reduction in monthly wholesale cable resale access prices for an interim period.
The Belgium Regulatory Authorities will replace these interim prices with “reasonable access tariffs” around mid-2019.

     The 2018 Decision aims to, and in its application, may strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to
Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in
developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (i) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet
to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (ii) adversely impact Telenet’s ability
to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the
extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access afforded to Telenet’s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such
access and other competitive factors or market developments. Telenet considers the 2018 Decision to be inconsistent with the
principle of technology-neutral regulation and the European Single Market Strategy to stimulate further investments in broadband
networks. Telenet has challenged the 2018 Decision in the Brussels Court of Appeal and has also initiated an action in the European
Court of Justice against the European Commission’s decision not to challenge the 2018 Decision. The timing and outcome of each
of these actions is uncertain.

     Virgin Media VAT Matters. Virgin Media’s application of VAT with respect to certain revenue generating activities has been
challenged by the U.K. tax authorities. Virgin Media has estimated its maximum exposure in the event of an unfavorable outcome
to be £47 million ($60 million) as of December 31, 2018. No portion of this exposure has been accrued by Virgin Media as the
likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. A court hearing was held at the end of September 2014 in relation to the U.K.
tax authorities’ challenge and a decision is expected in 2019.

     On March 19, 2014, the U.K. government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of VAT in connection
with prompt payment discounts such as those that we offer to our fixed-line telephony customers. This change, which took effect
on May 1, 2014, impacted our company and some of our competitors. The U.K. tax authority issued a decision in the fourth quarter
of 2015 challenging our application of the prompt payment discount rules prior to the May 1, 2014 change in legislation. We
appealed this decision. As part of the appeal process, we were required to make aggregate payments of £67.0 million ($99.1 million
at the respective transaction dates), comprising (i) the challenged amount of £63.7 million (which we paid during the fourth quarter
of 2015) and (ii) related interest of £3.3 million (which we paid during the first quarter of 2016). No provision was recorded by
our company at that time as the likelihood of loss was not considered to be probable. The aggregate amount paid does not include
penalties, which could be significant in the event that penalties were to be assessed. In September 2018, the court rejected our
appeal and ruled in favor of the U.K. tax authority. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a provision for
litigation of £63.7 million ($83.1 million at the average rate for the period) and related interest expense of £3.3 million ($4.4
million at the average rate for the period) in our consolidated statement of operations. We have submitted our grounds for appeal
to the Upper Tribunal and expect to receive approval to appeal the judgment during the first quarter of 2019; however, no assurance
can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter.

     Ziggo Acquisition Matter. In July 2015, KPN N.V. appealed the European Commission’s 2014 approval of the acquisition by
Liberty Global of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo). We were not a party to that case. In October 2017, the European Union (E.U.)
General Court annulled the European Commission’s approval on procedural grounds in that it found that the European Commission
had failed to adequately explain the reasons for elements of its decision. We re-notified our acquisition of Ziggo to the European
Commission for a new merger clearance, which was granted on May 30, 2018, and conditioned on remedies substantially similar
to the remedies upon which the 2014 merger clearance was based. We consider this matter to be closed.

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


     Other Regulatory Issues. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are
regulated in each of the countries in which we or our affiliates operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country,
although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the E.U.
Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on
us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the
number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition,
regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect
and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply
with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

     Effective April 1, 2017, the rateable value of our existing network and other assets in the U.K. increased significantly. This
increase affects the amount we pay for network infrastructure charges as the annual amount payable to the U.K. government is
calculated by applying a percentage multiplier to the rateable value of assets. This change has and will continue to significantly
increase our network infrastructure charges. As compared to 2018, we expect the aggregate amount of this increase will be £28
million ($36 million) in 2019. Beyond 2019, we expect further but declining increases to these charges through the first quarter
of 2022. We continue to believe that these increases are excessive and retain the right of appeal should more favorable agreements
be reached with other operators. The rateable value of network and other assets constructed under our network extension program
in the U.K. remains subject to review by the U.K. government.

     In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business
including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving VAT and wage, property, withholding and other tax issues and (iii) disputes
over interconnection, programming, copyright and channel carriage fees. While we generally expect that the amounts required to
satisfy these contingencies will not materially differ from any estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that
the resolution of one or more of these contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial position in any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack
of a clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows that might
result from any unfavorable outcomes.

(19)     Segment Reporting

    We generally identify our reportable segments as (i) those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more of our revenue,
Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets or (ii) those equity method affiliates where our investment or share of revenue
or Adjusted OIBDA represents 10% or more of our total assets, revenue or Adjusted OIBDA, respectively. In certain cases, we
may elect to include an operating segment in our segment disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable
segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial
measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. In addition, we review non-financial measures such as subscriber growth, as
appropriate.

     Adjusted OIBDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance
and is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii)
evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term,
“Adjusted OIBDA” is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions
and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating
items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful
and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other
acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers
believe Adjusted OIBDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance
that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical
comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different
countries in which we operate. A reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA from continuing operations to our earnings (loss) from
continuing operations before income taxes is presented below.

                                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
                                             December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016


    As of December 31, 2018, our reportable segments are as follows:

    Consolidated:

    •    U.K./Ireland
    •    Belgium
    •    Switzerland
    •    Central and Eastern Europe

    Nonconsolidated:

    •    VodafoneZiggo JV

    All of our reportable segments derive their revenue primarily from residential and B2B communications services, including
video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services.

     Segment information for all periods has been retrospectively revised to present (i) our operating segments in Austria, Germany,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania and (ii) UPC DTH, which was previously included in our Central and Eastern Europe
reportable segment, as discontinued operations. As a result, (a) our former Switzerland/Austria reportable segment now only
includes our operations in Switzerland and (b) our Central and Eastern Europe reportable segment now only includes our operations
in Poland and Slovakia. Our central and corporate functions (Central and Corporate) primarily include (1) revenue earned from
services provided to the VodafoneZiggo JV, (2) revenue from sales of customer premises equipment to the VodafoneZiggo JV, (3)
costs associated with certain centralized functions, including billing systems, network operations, technology, marketing, facilities,
finance and other administrative functions and (4) less significant consolidated operating segments that provide programming and
other services. On January 1, 2018, our wholesale handset program was transferred from Germany to an entity included in Central
and Corporate. In connection with our presentation of our operating segment in Germany as a discontinued operation, we have
retrospectively revised 2017 and 2016 to reflect this change.

     On December 31, 2016, we completed the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, whereby we contributed VodafoneZiggo Holding
(including Ziggo Sport) to the VodafoneZiggo JV. In our segment presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016,
VodafoneZiggo Holding (exclusive of Ziggo Sport, which became a subsidiary of VodafoneZiggo Holding in October 2016) is
separately reported as “The Netherlands” and Ziggo Sport is included in Central and Corporate. Effective January 1, 2017, following
the closing of the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, we have identified the VodafoneZiggo JV as a nonconsolidated reportable
segment. Accordingly, our results of operations for 2016 include the operations of VodafoneZiggo Holding and Ziggo Sport while
our results of operations for 2017 and 2018 and our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 exclude such
entities. For additional information regarding the VodafoneZiggo JV Transaction, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

      Performance Measures of Our Reportable Segments

     The amounts presented below represent 100% of each of our reportable segment’s revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. As we have
the ability to control Telenet, we consolidate 100% of Telenet’s revenue and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations
despite the fact that third parties own a significant interest. The noncontrolling owners’ interests in the operating results of Telenet
and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests
in our consolidated statements of operations. Similarly, despite only holding a 50% noncontrolling interest in the VodafoneZiggo
JV, we present 100% of its revenue and Adjusted OIBDA in the tables below. Our share of the VodafoneZiggo JV's operating
results is included in share of results of affiliates, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. For additional information,
see notes 1 and 5.

_______________

(a)     Residential cable subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential cable
        non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, channel carriage fees, late fees, and revenue from the sale of
        equipment. As described in note 2, we adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using the cumulative effect transition
        method. For periods subsequent to our adoption of ASU 2014-09, installation revenue is generally deferred and recognized
        over the contractual period as residential cable subscription revenue. For periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-09,
        installation revenue is included in residential cable non-subscription revenue.

(b)     Residential subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated
        proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone
        pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue
        categories from period to period.

(c)     Residential mobile subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential
        mobile non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, interconnect revenue and revenue from sales of mobile
        handsets and other devices.

(d)     B2B subscription revenue represents revenue from services to certain small or home office (SOHO) subscribers. SOHO
        subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony
        or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. B2B
        non-subscription revenue includes business broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony, mobile and data services offered
        to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators.

                                                                                    II-144

(e)     Other revenue includes, among other items, revenue earned from the JV Services, broadcasting revenue in Ireland and
        revenue from Central and Corporate’s wholesale handset program. In addition, the amount for 2018 includes revenue earned
        from (i) sales of customer premises equipment to the VodafoneZiggo JV and (ii) transitional and other services provided
        to Deutsche Telekom and Liberty Latin America.

(21)     Subsequent Event

     On February 27, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our operations in Switzerland, “UPC Switzerland,” to Sunrise
Communications Group AG (“Sunrise”) for a total enterprise value of CHF 6.3 billion ($6.3 billion at the February 27, 2019 rate).
Sunrise will acquire UPC Switzerland inclusive of the UPC Holding borrowing group’s existing senior and senior secured notes
and associated derivatives (together, the “UPC Holding Notes”) and certain other debt items, which have an aggregate value equal
to approximately CHF 3.7 billion ($3.7 billion at the February 27, 2019 rate) at December 31, 2018. The net cash proceeds are
expected to be CHF 2.6 billion ($2.6 billion at the February 27, 2019 rate), subject to customary other liabilities and working
capital adjustments at completion, and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.

     As the transaction is structured, a change of control will not be triggered under the UPC Holding Notes. UPC Facility AR
under the UPC Holding Bank Facility, which had an outstanding balance at December 31, 2018 of $1,645.0 million, is expected
to be repaid in full at or prior to closing.

    Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, which is expected prior to year-end 2019, and approval by Sunrise’s
shareholders with respect to an associated capital increase.

     In connection with the sale of UPC Switzerland, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Sunrise for a period
of up to five years following completion. Such transitional services principally comprise network and information technology-
related functions. The annual charges for such transitional services will depend on the actual level of transitional services required
by Sunrise.
