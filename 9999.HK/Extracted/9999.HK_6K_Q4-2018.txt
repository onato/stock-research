contribution from newer mobile games such as Night Falls: Survival and Ancient Nocturne. The year-over-
year increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from

year-over-year decrease in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and

higher margins.

and 61.4% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games and
licensed games, which have relatively lower profit margins than self-developed PC-client games. The year-
over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue while certain costs related to
the Company’s online games segment were fixed.

the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year

advertising services gross profit margin was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase
expenditures.

Gross loss margin for innovative businesses and others for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 5.2%, compared to
gross loss margin of 3.3% each for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross loss margin were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution
from certain online platform businesses which have relatively higher gross profit margins.

compared to RMB5,440.1 million and RMB4,317.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2017, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased staff-
related costs, research and development investments and shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling
costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB572.5 million
(US$83.3 million), compared to RMB385.5 million and RMB393.3 million for the preceding quarter and the
fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB919.7 million (US$133.8 million) for the fourth
quarter of 2018, compared to RMB843.8 million and RMB290.4 million for the preceding quarter and the

to 34.2% and 18.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The higher

experienced higher operating losses compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1,697.7
million (US$246.9 million), compared to RMB1,596.3 million and RMB1,285.6 million for the preceding

shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2,359.6 million (US$343.2 million), compared to

million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB56.1 million and a net foreign exchange loss of
RMB159.1 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The changes in
foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to foreign currency transactions and unrealized exchange
gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan
balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors

** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the
convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience
of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8755 on December 31, 2018 as set
forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB
amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on December 31, 2018, or at any other
certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective as of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the
financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from
e-commerce to the Company’s total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the
results of NetEase’s two e-commerce platforms, Kaola and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015
and April 2016, respectively. In addition, effective as of December 31, 2018, the Company renamed its “e-
mail and others” segment to “innovative businesses and others” to better articulate the businesses included in
this segment. The changes in segment reporting align with the manner in which the Company’s chief operating
decision maker (“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate
the performance of reporting segments. The changes in segment presentation do not affect consolidated
balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company
retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation. The
Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services and
innovative businesses and others.

Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the
modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately
RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as
a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the
Company’s operating results for fiscal year 2018 and comparable periods.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-
10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, and reclassified RMB38.2
million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company’s available-for-sale equity securities
that existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company
recorded net investment losses of RMB215.8 million related to the equity investments with readily
determinable fair value for fiscal year 2018. Given that there were no material observable price changes in
orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record
any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value for fiscal year
2018.




                                                       9
The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18 “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash” starting
from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash increased by an aggregate of RMB393.8 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to the amounts
presented under previous guidance.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial
statements and related notes to be included in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
December 31, 2018 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been
completed, the Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the
end of fiscal year 2018.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these
forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by
a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to
grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for
example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not
become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile
internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a
positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase’s affiliates will not be able to continue
operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls™, Heroes
of the Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible
governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline;
competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and
services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased
advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online
services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its online game and e-commerce
businesses; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in
NetEase’s existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the
effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive
and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the
Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase’s business and financial results; and
other risks outlined in NetEase’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not
undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable
law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the
non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability
may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.

*In 2018, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2016-18 issued by FASB in November 2016, which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash
equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, the Company included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period
and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows. Pursuant to the guidance, the Company retropsectively restated the statement of cash flows in the comparative periods.
