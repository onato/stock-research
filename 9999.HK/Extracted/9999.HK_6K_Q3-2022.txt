represented low single digits as a percentage of NetEase’s total net revenues and net income in 2021

Director of NetEase said, “Steady growth characterized our third quarter, generating total net revenues

gains. Beloved flagship titles such as our Fantasy Westward Journey sagas further grew in the third
quarter, impressing the industry with their strength and longevity. The successful launch of thrilling
new games such as Diablo® Immortal™ is a further testament to our robust R&D programs and ability
to captivate the attention of players in the international arena.”

“In addition to our games, we maintained our differentiated offerings with Youdao, Cloud Music and
Yanxuan businesses. As we move forward, we will continue to leverage our innovative content and
services to drive sustainable growth across each of our carefully cultivated businesses,” Mr. Ding
concluded.

games as well as other related or ancillary services to the games, were RMB18,699.1 million
(US$2,628.7 million) for the third quarter of 2022, compared with RMB18,139.8 million and

with RMB12,941.5 million and RMB11,810.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2021, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in games and related value-added services gross
profit were primarily due to increased net revenues from online games, including the Fantasy
Westward Journey Online series and Infinite Lagrange, and certain newly launched titles.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in Youdao gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in
net revenues from improved economies of scale for its learning services as well as increased sales
volume of its smart devices.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music gross profit were primarily due
to increased net revenues from its social entertainment services, as well as continuously improved cost
control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in innovative businesses and others gross profit
were primarily due to increased gross profit contribution from Yanxuan.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the third quarter of 2022 was 65.0%,
compared with 64.9% and 61.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively.
The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to changes in the revenue
contribution from different distribution channels.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2022 was 54.2%, compared with 42.8% and
56.6% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
increase was primarily attributable to the factors enumerated above. The year-over-year decrease



                                                  4
mainly resulted from a decline in economies of scale due to the decreased net revenues from its learning
services.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music was 14.2% for the third quarter of 2022, compared with 13.0%
and 2.2% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2022 was 25.5%,
compared with 25.8% and 27.2% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively.
The year-over-year fluctuations were mainly due to changes in gross profit margin from advertising
services.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2022 were RMB9,002.1 million (US$1,265.5 million),
compared with RMB7,995.2 million and RMB8,035.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due
to increased marketing expenditures related to games and related value-added services and Youdao, as
well as higher staff-related costs.

Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment income/ (loss), interest income, exchange gains/
(losses) and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to
investment income arising from the disposal of certain equity investments and net unrealized exchange
gains arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and loans balances as the
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated in the third quarter of 2022.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,586.7 million (US$223.1 million) for the
third quarter of 2022, compared with RMB1,259.3 million and RMB807.6 million for the preceding
quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022
was 19.3%, compared with 22.0% and 19.6% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021,
respectively. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax
obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

million) for the third quarter of 2022, compared with RMB5,291.5 million and RMB3,181.8 million
for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively. Net income attributable to the

billion) for the third quarter of 2022, compared with RMB6.6 billion and RMB6.3 billion for the
preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2021, respectively.




Change in Segment Reporting

Effective as of the second quarter of 2022, the Company implemented certain changes to align its
segment financial reporting more closely with the manner in which the Company’s management
currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance
of reporting segments. The Company renamed its “online game services” segment as “games and
related value-added services,” and transferred certain business lines that are related or ancillary to its
games from “innovative businesses and others” to “games and related value-added services,” including
the NetEase CC live streaming service (a platform offering various live streaming content with a
primary focus on game broadcasting) and other value-added services. The Company retrospectively
recast prior periods’ segment information to conform to current period presentation. These changes
had no impact on NetEase’s previously reported consolidated net revenues, net income or net income
per share.




Share Repurchase/ Purchase Program

On February 25, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share
repurchase program of up to US$2.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs and ordinary shares

such program to increase the total authorized repurchase amount to US$3.0 billion. As of September
30, 2022, approximately 27.0 million ADSs had been repurchased under this program for a total cost
of US$2.5 billion.

The Company also announced today that its board of directors has approved a new share repurchase
program of up to US$5.0 billion of the Company’s ADSs and ordinary shares in open market
transactions. This new share repurchase program will be in effect for a period not to exceed 36 months,
commencing upon the expiration of the Company’s existing share repurchase program or, if earlier,
the date on which the Company has repurchased the maximum amount authorized under the existing
program.

On August 31, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share purchase
program of up to US$50.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 36 months
beginning on September 2, 2021. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao’s
ADSs in open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. As of September 30, 2022,
approximately 2.3 million ADSs had been purchased under this program for a total cost of US$20.7
million.

                                                    7

                                                   9
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted
net income from continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing
and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders
excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating
results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial
measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable
to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore
their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure,
all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited
Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase
encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial
measure.
