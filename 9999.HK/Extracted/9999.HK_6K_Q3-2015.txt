                    NetEase Reports Third Quarter 2015 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing – November 11, 2015) – NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES), one of China’s leading Internet and online
game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September
30, 2015.

“We are honored to be a leading developer and operator of some of the country’s most popular games as
China’s online game industry is on track to become the world’s largest gaming market,” said Mr. William
Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Our third quarter financial results reflect our success
at innovation with total net revenues increasing by 114.1% compared with the third quarter of last year. We
grew our top-line net revenues across our three business segments both sequentially and year-over-year, with
year-over-year increases of 124.5% in online games, 10.5% in advertising services and 162.2% in e-mail, e-
commerce and others.”

“Our self-developed and licensed PC-client games maintain a healthy appeal to our users, while our mobile
games are driving new growth. During the third quarter of this year, we launched our Westward Journey
Online mobile game, which together with our Fantasy Westward Journey mobile game, are now the top two
grossing games in the iOS China app store. Players’ appetite for our new self-developed PC-client game
Revelation, a 3D oriental fantasy MMORPG, was also strong in the third quarter, and we saw continued
interest in Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls™ and Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™. A
number of new expansion packs for our PC-client games were warmly received during the third quarter as
well, including Fantasy Westward Journey II and a new version of Ghost II, named New Ghost. Additionally,
we have entered into collaboration between New Ghost and an urban TV show, which is based on a renowned
youth romance novel. This cooperation represents the initiation of our strategy to utilize innovative marketing
models for our games that further extend our brand.”

“Today, our mobile portfolio stands strong with more than 50 titles, and we plan to grow this position with
self-developed and licensed games that continue to delight our players. These include games that we have
launched since July of this year that have gained immediate traction such as Fairy Tales: The World of the
Brave, Kari-ri-sei Million Arthur, Lunar Flowers, The Beautiful Dream and Chrono Blade. In addition, we are

	                                                    1	  
planning for the exciting introduction of our highly-anticipated Kung Fu Panda mobile game in late
November, as well as The X-World, Fantasy Westward Journey: Warriors and Raven in the coming months.
For our PC-client games, the new expansion pack for Kung Fu Master II, which we released in October, is
being well received. We also look forward to bringing our PC-client players thrilling new experiences with
expansion packs planned for Tianxia III, Heroes of Tang Dynasty Zero, and the new release of Hegemon-King
of Western Chu.”

“Advertisers are continuing the transition from PC to mobile, a platform where our foothold is particularly
strong. Supported by the popularity of our Mobile News App, we are seeing continued growth in our
advertising revenues from mobile platforms. During the third quarter, our advertising services’ net revenues
growth was led by the automobile, Internet services and food and beverage sectors. Our cross-border e-
commerce platform Kaola.com also continued to grow rapidly during the third quarter and we are seeing
sustained strong momentum from our e-commerce business.”

“Our portfolio of PC-client and mobile games is robust and growing. In addition to the domestic popularity of
our mobile initiatives that span games, apps, advertising services and e-commerce, we have now launched
several new games for overseas audiences to a positive reception. Along with our rapid mobile growth, our
focus remains on superior quality and innovation, particularly where there is an opportunity to enhance our
offerings with IP and data sharing between our PC-client and mobile games, and other product and service
offerings across our business lines,” Mr. Ding concluded.

Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were RMB6,671.8 million (US$1,049.7 million), compared to
RMB4,567.9 million and RMB3,116.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB5,212.9 million (US$820.2 million) for the third quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB3,657.1 million and RMB2,322.0 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2014, respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB454.9 million (US$71.6 million) for the third quarter of
2015, compared to RMB427.7 million and RMB411.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2014, respectively.

Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB1,004.0 million (US$158.0 million) for the third
quarter of 2015, compared to RMB483.0 million and RMB383.0 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2014, respectively.




	                                                   2	  
Gross Profit

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2015 was RMB3,849.3 million (US$605.6 million), compared to
RMB2,845.6 million and RMB2,258.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014,
respectively.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in online games gross profit were primarily driven by
revenue contribution from mobile games such as the Fantasy Westward Journey mobile game and licensed
games such as Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls™ and Hearthstone®: Heroes of
Warcraft™, as well as NetEase’s new self-developed PC-client games such as Revelation.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily
attributable to strong demand from the automobile, Internet services and food and beverage sectors, and
NetEase’s monetization efforts for its mobile applications, primarily its Mobile News App.

The year-over-year decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to the temporary
suspension of higher margin e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products since late February
2015, which was partially offset by increased revenue contribution from NetEase’s other e-commerce
platforms, which have relatively lower gross profit margins. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily
due to the one-off recognition of expenses related to certain copyrights in the third quarter of 2015.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the third quarter of 2015 was 67.9%, compared to 69.3%
and 77.2% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margin were mainly due to increased revenue contribution from
mobile games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online
games revenues.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the third quarter of 2015 was 67.6%, compared to
68.2% and 65.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014, respectively.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the third quarter of 2015 was 0.1%,
compared to 4.2% and 51.6% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-
over-year decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the temporary suspension of higher
margin e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products discussed above, as well as increased
revenue contribution from NetEase’s other e-commerce platforms, which have relatively lower gross profit
margins. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to the one-off recognition of expenses related to
certain copyrights in the third quarter of 2015.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were RMB1,761.2 million (US$277.1 million),
compared to RMB1,395.2 million and RMB1,059.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of


	                                                    3	  
2014, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly
due to increased selling and marketing expenses for mobile and PC-client games, advertising services and
other mobile products, and higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average
compensation.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB399.2 million (US$62.8 million) for the third quarter
of 2015, compared to RMB145.9 million and RMB197.3 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was 17.1%, compared to
9.2% and 14.4% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year
increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were
approved as Key Software Enterprises and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2014. Those
subsidiaries were subject to a tax rate of 15% in 2015. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the effective tax
rate was mainly due to the fact that the Company recognized certain tax credits in the second quarter of 2015
related to annual tax filing benefits, most of which comprised extra tax deductions for research and
development expenses approved by the tax authorities.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the third quarter of 2015 totaled RMB1.9 billion
(US$296.1 million), compared to RMB1.4 billion and RMB1.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2014, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders
[1]
    for the third quarter of 2015 totaled RMB2.1 billion (US$322.6 million), compared to RMB1.6 billion and
RMB1.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB66.5 million (US$10.5
million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB21.7 million and a net foreign exchange gain of
RMB2.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains/(losses) were mainly due to unrealized exchange
gains/(losses) arising from the Company’s foreign currency-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan
balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.25 and US$2.24, respectively, for the third
quarter of 2015. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.70 and US$1.69,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.40 and US$1.39,
respectively, for the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were	  US$2.45 and
US$2.44,	   respectively, for the third quarter of 2015, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per
ADS of US$1.90 and US$1.89, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and US$1.51 each for the third quarter
of 2014.

expenses. See "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release.

Quarterly Dividend

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.39 per ADS for the first quarter of 2015 on June 5, 2015, and US$0.44 per
ADS for the second quarter of 2015 on September 4, 2015.

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.56 per ADS for the third quarter of 2015, which is
expected to be paid on December 4, 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November
27, 2015. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any
particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the
Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Other Information

As of September 30, 2015, the Company’s total cash and current and non-current time deposits balance was
RMB20.4 billion (US$3.2 billion), compared to RMB21.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. Cash flow
generated from operating activities was RMB2.2 billion (US$346.5 million) for the third quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB835.9 million and RMB1.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2014,
respectively.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, NetEase made a reclassification of certain revenue and cost of revenue
items from its advertising services segment to its e-mail, e-commerce and others segment. The segments
reclassification reflects changes in the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its
operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Share Repurchase Program

On September 1, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase
program of up to US$500 million of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months.
NetEase plans to fund repurchases made under this program from available working capital. Under the terms
of the approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market
transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions
will be subject to Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected
that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. As of
September 30, 2015, the Company has repurchased approximately 0.19 million ADSs for about US$20.7
million under this program.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures we use may differ from the non-
GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may
be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the

end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
