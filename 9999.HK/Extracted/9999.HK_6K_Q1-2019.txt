The quarter-over-quarter increase in e-commerce gross profit was primarily due to seasonality with larger-
scale promotions and certain sales discounts in the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in e-

contribution based on the evolving competitive macro-environment, and increased expenses related to staff
and content purchases.

seasonality with lower revenues generated from Cloud Music and NetEase CC, a live video streaming platform,
as well as higher copyright costs. The year-over-year increase in innovative businesses and others gross loss
was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have
relatively higher gross margins, and partially offset by improving economies of scale of Cloud Music.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were RMB4,681.6 million (US$697.6 million),
compared to RMB5,412.3 million and RMB4,746.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,269.0 million (US$189.1 million) for the first
quarter of 2019, compared to RMB919.7 million and RMB282.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first
quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 34.0%, compared to 34.0%

million), compared to net foreign exchange losses of RMB27.1 million and RMB375.1 million for the

mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank
deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over
the periods, as well as certain foreign currency transactions.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.77 and US$2.75, respectively, for the first
quarter of 2019. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.98 and US$1.96,

convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience
of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.7112 on March 29, 2019 as set forth

amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on March 29, 2019, or at any other

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective as of December 31, 2018, the Company renamed its “e-mail and others” segment to “innovative
businesses and others” to better articulate the businesses included in this segment, there’s no change to the
business mix included in this segment. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game
services, e-commerce, advertising services and innovative businesses and others, and retrospectively revised
prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.

Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncement

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases” as amended, which generally requires lessees to
recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet
and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified
retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately
RMB861.5 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its
consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The Company recognized RMB747.4 million and
RMB763.2 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases
on its consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term
assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables
respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the
Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the net assets of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those

grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for
example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not
become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile
internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a
positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase’s affiliates will not be able to continue
operating Minecraft or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible
governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline;
competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and
services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased
advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the
non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability
may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
