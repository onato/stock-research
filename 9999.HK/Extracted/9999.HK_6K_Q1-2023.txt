based compensation expenses. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at

First Quarter 2023 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the first quarter of 2023 were RMB25,046.3 million (US$3,647.0 million), compared
with RMB25,354.1 million and RMB23,555.8 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2022, respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB20,065.6 million (US$2,921.8
million) for the first quarter of 2023, compared with RMB19,085.7 million and RMB18,641.8 million
for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively. Net revenues from the operation
of online games accounted for approximately 92.7% of the segment’s net revenues for the first quarter
of 2023, compared with 91.8% and 92.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022,
respectively. Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 72.3% of net revenues
from the operation of online games for the first quarter of 2023, compared with 66.4% and 66.9% for
the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1,163.3 million (US$169.4 million) for the first quarter of 2023,
compared with RMB1,454.0 million and RMB1,200.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first
quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from Cloud Music were RMB1,959.8 million (US$285.4 million) for the first quarter of
2023, compared with RMB2,376.3 million and RMB2,067.2 million for the preceding quarter and the
first quarter of 2022, respectively. In the first quarter of 2023, Cloud Music introduced a number of
measures to its live streaming services to enhance the listening experience of more dedicated music
fans and reinforce its risk controls. These included reducing the in-app exposure of certain live
streaming functions and lowering broadcasters’ and agencies’ revenue sharing ratio. These measures
led to a decrease in net revenues from Cloud Music’s social entertainment services in the first quarter.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1,857.6 million (US$270.5 million) for
the first quarter of 2023, compared with RMB2,438.2 million and RMB1,646.3 million for the

                                                   3
Gross Profit

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2023 was RMB14,896.5 million (US$2,169.1 million), compared
with RMB13,244.4 million and RMB12,836.4 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2022, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in games and related value-added services’ gross profit was primarily
due to increased net revenues from the operation of online games such as Eggy Party, as well as the
one-off recognition of royalty fees related to certain licensed games recorded under cost of revenues
in the preceding quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from
the operation of online games such as Eggy Party, which was launched in May 2022.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao’s gross profit primarily resulted from decreased net
revenues from smart devices due to seasonality, as well as the adverse impact from the pandemic in
the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from decreased net revenues
from learning services.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music’s gross profit primarily resulted
from continued improvement in cost control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in innovative businesses and others’ gross profit was primarily due
to decreased e-commerce net revenues from Yanxuan and advertising services resulting from
seasonality. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased e-commerce net revenues from
Yanxuan.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the first quarter of 2023 was 66.7%,
compared with 59.1% and 62.2% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to the one-off recognition of royalty fees
related to certain licensed games recorded under cost of revenues in the preceding quarter, as well as
changes in the revenue mix of NetEase’s self-developed, co-developed and licensed games. The year-
over-year increase was attributable to changes in the revenue mix.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the first quarter of 2023 was 51.7%, compared with 53.3% and
53.1% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease was mainly due to the reduction in net revenues from smart devices, while the year-over-year
decrease was mainly due to decreased net revenues from learning services, as enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music was 22.4% for the first quarter of 2023, compared with 17.8%
and 12.2% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the improvement in cost control
measures.



                                                  4
Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the first quarter of 2023 was 25.4%,
compared with 31.5% and 21.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year fluctuations were mainly due to the factors enumerated
above.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were RMB7,676.5 million (US$1,117.8 million),
compared with RMB8,810.9 million and RMB7,329.3 million for the preceding quarter and the first
quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased
marketing and research and development expenditures related to games and related value-added
services. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher staff-related costs.

Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment (loss)/ income, interest income, exchange losses and
others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in other income were mainly due to
higher investment income from fair value changes of equity investments with readily determinable fair
value.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,628.6 million (US$237.1 million) for the
first quarter of 2023, compared with RMB966.6 million and RMB1,219.3 million for the preceding
quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023
was 19.5%, compared with 20.2% and 22.0% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022,
respectively. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax
obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB6,754.6 million (US$983.6
million) for the first quarter of 2023, compared with RMB3,952.7 million and RMB4,394.0 million
for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.

NetEase reported basic net income of US$0.31 per share (US$1.53 per ADS) for the first quarter of
2023, compared with US$0.18 per share (US$0.89 per ADS) and US$0.20 per share (US$0.98 per
ADS) for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.

Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB7,566.2 million
(US$1,101.7 million) for the first quarter of 2023, compared with RMB4,811.4 million and
RMB5,117.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.

identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. In addition, statements

in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted

such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in government
regulation that could adversely affect the industry and geographical markets in which NetEase operates,

                                                    8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its
financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
