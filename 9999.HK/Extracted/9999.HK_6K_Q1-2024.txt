First Quarter 2024 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were RMB26.9 billion (US$3.7 billion), compared with
RMB27.1 billion and RMB25.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023,
respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB21.5 billion (US$3.0 billion) for
the first quarter of 2024, compared with RMB20.9 billion and RMB20.1 billion for the preceding
quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. Net revenues from the operation of online games
accounted for approximately 95.2% of the segment’s net revenues for the first quarter of 2024,
compared with 93.4% and 92.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.
Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 78.6% of net revenues from the
operation of online games for the first quarter of 2024, compared with 76.7% and 72.3% for the
preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.

compared with RMB1.5 billion and RMB1.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2023, respectively.

                                                  3
Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB2.0 billion (US$272.8 million) for the
first quarter of 2024, compared with RMB2.8 billion and RMB1.9 billion for the preceding quarter
and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was RMB17.0 billion (US$2.4 billion), compared with
RMB16.8 billion and RMB14.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023,
respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in games and related value-added services’
gross profit were primarily due to increased net revenues from mobile games such as Eggy Party and
certain newly launched titles.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao’s gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue
contribution from its learning services and sales of smart devices. The year-over-year increase was
primarily due to increased revenue contribution from its online marketing services.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music’s gross profit primarily resulted
from the one-off adjustment of certain copyright costs, increased net revenues from sales of
membership subscriptions and continued improvement in cost control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in innovative businesses and others’ gross profit was primarily due
to decreased e-commerce net revenues from Yanxuan and advertising services resulting from
seasonality. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased gross profit from Yanxuan and
several other businesses included within the segment.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the first quarter of 2024 was 69.5%,
compared with 69.5% and 66.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.
The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to changes in revenue contribution from different
platforms and self-developed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the first quarter of 2024 was 49.0%, compared with 49.9% and
51.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to increased revenue contribution from its online
marketing services, which have a lower gross profit margin compared to its other products and services.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music for the first quarter of 2024 was 38.0%, compared with 30.3%
and 22.4% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above. The one-
off adjustment of certain copyright costs mentioned above increased the gross profit margin in the first
quarter of 2024 by approximately five percentage points.



                                                   4
Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the first quarter of 2024 was 33.4%,
compared with 34.4% and 25.4% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased revenue contribution from advertising
services. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to improved gross profit margins from Yanxuan
and several other businesses included within the segment.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were RMB9.4 billion (US$1.3 billion), compared
with RMB10.0 billion and RMB7.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023,
respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased research and
development investments related to games and related value-added services and marketing
expenditures, as well as lower staff-related costs. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to
increased marketing expenditures and higher staff-related costs.

Other Income/(Expenses)

Other income/(expenses) consisted of investment income/(loss), interest income, exchange (losses)/
gains and others. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to net exchange gains in the first
quarter of 2024 compared with net exchange losses recorded in the prior quarter. The year-over-year
increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income resulting from the improved net cash
position and net exchange gains in the first quarter of 2024, compared with net exchange losses
recorded in the first quarter of 2023.

Income Tax

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1.5 billion (US$205.8 million) for the first
quarter of 2024, compared with RMB1.1 billion and RMB1.6 billion for the preceding quarter and the
first quarter of 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 16.0%,
compared with 13.8% and 19.5% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.
The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits
applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB7.6 billion (US$1.1 billion) for
the first quarter of 2024, compared with RMB6.6 billion and RMB6.8 billion for the preceding quarter
and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.

NetEase reported basic net income of US$0.33 per share (US$1.65 per ADS) for the first quarter of
2024, compared with US$0.28 per share (US$1.42 per ADS) and US$0.29 per share (US$1.45 per

that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its
expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management
in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online games market will not
continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in government
regulation that could adversely affect the industry and geographical markets in which NetEase
operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online

related to economic uncertainty and capital market disruption; risks related to the expansion of

                                                    8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provide useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See the unaudited reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
