          NetEase Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing – February 9, 2015) – NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES), one of China’s leading Internet and online
game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended December 31, 2014.

“In 2014 we made exciting strides across our three business lines. With considerable advancements among our
traditional online and mobile games portfolios, and portal and e-commerce offerings, our total revenues for
2014 grew by 27.7% year-over-year,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of
NetEase. “We completed the year with a 42.5% increase in fourth quarter revenues compared to the fourth
quarter of 2013, led by a 35.7% increase in online game services, a 22.7% increase in advertising services and
a 224.2% increase from our expanding e-mail, e-commerce and others business.”

“Our fourth quarter online game services revenues grew by 16.4% compared to the preceding quarter, with
standout performances from both our self-developed and licensed online games. Following the launch of a
new item-based version in August, New Westward Journey Online II achieved record user statistics in the
fourth quarter. Our newly-launched mobile games demonstrated strong traction with users as well, especially
our self-developed mobile battle arena game, Battle to the West, and mobile 3-D action adventure, The World
HD, which was adapted from our online game Tianxia III. Both of these games have become highly ranked in
the China mobile game market. The November launch of the fifth expansion set to Blizzard Entertainment’s
World of Warcraft®, Warlords of Draenor™ in mainland China was also met with great player enthusiasm.
Moreover, we saw solid performances from the games for which we introduced new expansion packs in the
fourth quarter, including Fantasy Westward Journey II, Tianxia III, Ghost II, and Heroes of Tang Dynasty
Zero.”

“At the beginning of 2015, we initiated the small-scale commercial launch of Revelation, our 3-D oriental
fantasy MMORPG, and beta testing for Hegemon-King of Western Chu, our 3-D warfare MMORPG. We are
pleased by the positive early feedback for these games. Additionally, in January, Blizzard’s free-to-play,
online team brawler, Heroes of the Storm™, began closed beta testing in China, and we continue to work
closely with Blizzard to bring this and other exciting game content to Chinese audiences.”

	                                                    1	  
“Mobile Internet is playing an increasing role in China’s expanding Internet market. In 2014 we succeeded in
releasing 12 self-developed and licensed mobile games, demonstrating our growing capabilities in mobile
game developing and publishing. We plan to introduce more mobile games this year. Our YiChat user base
also continues to grow, supported by the introduction of new functionalities and features in the fourth quarter.
We are expanding our reach with this popular networking site by introducing an enterprise version of YiChat
for small and medium-sized enterprises.”

“Our advertising business remains strong. In 2014, the growth of our advertising services was driven by
increased market demand, mainly from the automobile, communication services and foods and beverages
sectors, and greater monetization of our Mobile News Application. The 2014 FIFA World Cup also boosted
advertising revenues during the year. In the fourth quarter, the top-performing advertising verticals were
automobile, financial services and Internet services. We are optimistic about the growth for this business in
2015 and plan to focus on mobile advertising where we see significant interest from our customers.
Additionally, our e-commerce business expanded at a healthy pace in 2014.”

“We plan to introduce more mobile games in 2015, including mobile games adapted from or inspired by our
existing popular PC client games. We believe this will help to increase stickiness within our community by
offering innovative games and services on both traditional and mobile platforms. We recently launched a self-
operated cross-border e-commerce platform, Kaola, which we see as an opportunity to provide a new type of
service offering to our users. We will continue to strive to attract new users to support healthy growth across
our business lines in 2015 and beyond,” Mr. Ding concluded.

respectively.

Revenues from online games were RMB2,863.3 million (US$461.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2014,

Sales Taxes

Total sales taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 were RMB220.6 million (US$35.6 million), compared to
RMB209.2 million and RMB162.7 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013,
respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in sales tax were mainly due to the
increase in NetEase’s total revenues.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was RMB2,485.4 million (US$400.6 million), compared to
RMB2,258.4 million and RMB1,727.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenues from
certain self-developed games, such as Fantasy Westward Journey II and New Westward Journey Online II, and
various mobile game products. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online games gross profit was primarily
driven by increased revenue from certain self-developed online and mobile games, such as New Westward
Journey Online II and Battle to the West, as well as Warlords of Draenor, the fifth expansion set to Blizzard’s
World of Warcraft.

The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily the result of strong demand from
the financial services, communication services and real estate sectors, and NetEase’s monetization efforts for
its Mobile News Application and other mobile applications. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in advertising
services gross profit was mainly due to higher revenue related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in	   the preceding
quarter.

The year-over-year increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily attributable to an
increase in revenue from NetEase’s e-commerce business. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail, e-
commerce and others gross profit was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from the Company’s e-
commerce business in the fourth quarter.

Gross Profit (Loss) Margin

Gross profit margin for NetEase’s online games business for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 76.0%, compared
to a gross profit margin of 77.2% and 77.7% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013,
respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in gross profit margin were mainly due to
increased revenue contribution from mobile games and licensed games, which have relatively lower gross
profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online game revenues.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 66.8%, compared
to a gross profit margin of 66.3% and 57.8% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013,
respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to enhanced economies of
scale driven by revenue growth.



	                                                    3	  
Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 45.6%,
compared to a gross profit margin of 49.6% for the preceding quarter and gross loss margin of 4.0% for the
fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to
increased revenue from NetEase’s e-commerce business, which has a relatively higher gross profit margin.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 were RMB1,239.7 million (US$199.8 million),
compared to RMB1,059.2 million and RMB648.3 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2013, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and
marketing expenses for the promotion of NetEase’s online and mobile games and licensed Blizzard games,
promotions for NetEase’s e-commerce business and advertising services, as well as staff-related research and
development costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and average compensation. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased selling and marketing expenses for online games
and the Company’s e-commerce business.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB187.9 million (US$30.3 million) for the fourth quarter
of 2014, compared to net income tax charges of RMB197.3 million and RMB49.4 million for the preceding
quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was
12.8%, compared to 14.4% and 3.8% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013, respectively.
The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the
Company were approved as Key Software Enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2013. Accordingly, they became
subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years, and the resulting 2013 tax credit
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Net Income After Tax

Net profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled RMB1.3 billion (US$204.9 million), compared to RMB1.2
billion and RMB1.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB7.1 million (US$1.1
million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB2.2 million and a net foreign exchange loss of
RMB17.6 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year changes in foreign exchange gains/(losses) were mainly due to exchange
gains/(losses) arising from the Company’s foreign currency-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan
balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic earnings per ADS of US$1.57 and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.56 for the fourth
quarter of 2014. The Company reported basic earnings per ADS of US$1.43 and diluted earnings per ADS of
US$1.42 for the preceding quarter, and reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.53 each for the
fourth quarter of 2013.

Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results

Revenues

Total revenues for fiscal year 2014 were RMB12.5 billion (US$2.0 billion), compared to RMB9.8 billion for
the preceding fiscal year. Revenues from online games were RMB9.8 billion (US$1.6 billion) for fiscal year
2014, compared to RMB8.3 billion for the preceding fiscal year. Revenues from advertising services were
RMB1.6 billion (US$250.1 million) for fiscal year 2014, compared to RMB1.1 billion for the preceding fiscal
year. Revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB1.1 billion (US$179.5 million) for fiscal year
2014, compared to RMB368.0 million for the preceding fiscal year.

Gross Profit (Loss)

Gross profit for fiscal year 2014 was RMB8.5 billion (US$1.4 billion), compared to RMB6.7 billion for the
preceding fiscal year. The increase in gross profit for fiscal year 2014 was primarily driven by increased
revenues from online game services, advertising services and e-commerce business.

The increase in online game services gross profit in 2014 was primarily attributable to increased revenues
from the Company’s self-developed games such as Fantasy Westward Journey II, New Westward Journey
Online II and various mobile games, as well as from Blizzard’s Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™.

The increase in advertising services gross profit in 2014 was due to a rise in demand, mainly from the
automobile, communication services and foods and beverages sectors, as well as from the increased
monetization of the NetEase Mobile News Application and the impact of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

The improvement in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit in 2014 was primarily attributable to an
increase in revenue from NetEase’s e-commerce business.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2014 were RMB3.7 billion (US$594.1 million), compared to RMB2.4
billion for the preceding fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses in 2014 was primarily due to increased
marketing expenses as a result of marketing and promotional activities for NetEase’s online games, e-
commerce and advertising services businesses, mainly due to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and increased
research and development expenses resulting from increased headcount and average compensation.

Net Income After Tax

Net profit for fiscal year 2014 totaled RMB4.8 billion (US$766.6 million), compared to RMB4.4 billion for
the preceding fiscal year. For fiscal year 2014, the Company reported a net foreign exchange loss of RMB18.0
million (US$2.9 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB15.3 million for the preceding
fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss for 2014 was mainly due to exchange losses arising from the
Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposit and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over these periods. NetEase reported basic earnings per ADS of


	                                                     5	  
US$5.87 and diluted earnings per ADS of US$5.85 for fiscal year 2014. The Company reported basic earnings
per ADS of US$5.51 and diluted earnings per ADS of US$5.50 for the preceding fiscal year.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB662.7 million (US$106.8 million) and RMB530.6
million for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate was 12.1% for fiscal year 2014,
compared to 10.7% for fiscal year 2013. The change in the effective tax rate was mainly due to a one-off tax
benefit of RMB304.6 million that the Company recorded in 2013 due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the
Company were approved in 2013 as Key Software Enterprises with respect to fiscal years 2011 and 2012.

Quarterly Dividend

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.34 per ADS for the first quarter of 2014 on June 3, 2014, US$0.37 per ADS
for the second quarter of 2014 on September 5, 2014 and US$0.36 per ADS for the third quarter of 2014 on
December 5, 2014.

2015.

The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular
quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company’s
operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.
