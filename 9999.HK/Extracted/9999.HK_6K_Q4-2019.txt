“We saw strong growth across our primary businesses, increasing our total annual net revenues and net
income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders year-over-year by 16% and
60%, respectively, due to strong performances in our online game services as well as other business segments,”
said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Our online game services net
revenues continued to grow, propelled by the sustained and growing popularity of our existing titles, again
demonstrating the longevity of our game franchises. At the end of the year, we launched the long-anticipated
Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, which gave us a wonderful start to the first quarter. We will continue to bring
more masterpieces to both domestic and global players in 2020.

“Our online education and music businesses also performed remarkably well. Youdao is exploring new
approaches to grow its business, replicating successful course experiences to produce premium learning
content, products and scale with a positive impact to its margins. Our differentiation in music offerings is also
becoming more evident. We are helping hundreds of thousands of independent musicians create and promote
their work to Chinese music lovers with our platform’s specialized promotion and distribution capabilities in
independent music. We believe that NetEase’s orientation as a forerunner in these evolving markets positions
us well for growth and the ability to create additional value for our stakeholders. Finally, with respect to the
COVID-19 outbreak, we currently expect to see some impact to our business lines in the near-term, however,
the situation is evolving. NetEase is committed to providing support to affected communities and working
together as we move through this challenging time,” Mr. Ding concluded.

** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the
convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience
of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB 6.9618 on December 31, 2019 as set
forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB
amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on December 31, 2019, or at any other
certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed its segment disclosure to add the financial results
of its certain advertising services and Yanxuan into innovative businesses and others in light of the relatively
small revenue contribution from those businesses to the Company’s total consolidated net revenues in 2019.
The Company sold its Kaola e-commerce business in September 2019. In addition, the Company has
commenced separately reporting the results of its majority-controlled subsidiary Youdao, Inc. which
completed its initial public offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2019. As a result,
since the third quarter of 2019 the Company has reported the following segments: online game services,
Youdao and innovative businesses and others. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment
information to conform to current period presentation. This change in segment reporting aligns with the
manner in which the Company’s operating decision maker (“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial
information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments.


                                                       8
Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases” as amended, which generally requires lessees to
recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet
and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified
retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately
RMB577.0 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its
consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, excluding the impact from held-for-sale businesses. The
Company recognized RMB463.7 million and RMB471.4 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease
liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual
liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables, respectively based on payment terms on the
consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a
material impact on the net assets of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial
statements and related notes to be included in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
December 31, 2019 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been
completed, the Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the
end of fiscal year 2019.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could
result in significant differences between the Company’s audited financial statements and this preliminary
unaudited financial information.

services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the risk that
the e-commerce market or the internet advertising market in China will not grow and will remain subject to
intense competition; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods;
competition in NetEase’s existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible
changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of
NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the
value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase’s business and financial
results; and other risks outlined in NetEase’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase
does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the
applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from
continuing operations per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance
and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding
share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the
Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the
impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the
Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so
choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it
does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-
GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which
should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-
GAAP Results” at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in
its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Note: The Company has adjusted the related gain from disposal of Kaola e-commerce business in the third quarter of 2019 from continuing operations to discontinued operations. This resulted in a
decrease in “ Other, net ” and “ Income tax”, and an increase in “ Net (loss)/ income from discontinued operations ”, in the Company’s consolidated statements of income, amounting to RM B8,751.2
million for the third quarter of 2019. Accordingly, basic and diluted net income per ADS from continuing operations decreased by RM B67.82 and RM B67.23, respectively, and basic and diluted net
income per ADS from discontinued operations increased by the same amounts for the third quarter of 2019. There is no impact on “Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders”.
