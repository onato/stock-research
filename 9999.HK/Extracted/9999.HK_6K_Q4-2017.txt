extended reach and momentum to support our future long-term growth.

“Our business remains strong and our 2018 initiatives to bring exciting new titles to our robust and diverse
portfolio of self-developed games are well underway. To expand our reach, we will also seek partnerships
with other industry leaders to bring mobile and PC-client games to audiences worldwide. Our e-commerce
businesses and advertising services are also thriving, with e-commerce accounting for approximately 22% of
our total net revenues in 2017. We will continue to expand our Kaola.com and Yanxuan e-commerce
platforms in 2018 along with our other business segments where we see opportunities to generate value for
our shareholders, as well as serve and grow our community of users by providing best-in-class online content
and services,” Mr. Ding concluded.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective as of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the
financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from
e-commerce to the Company’s total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the
results of NetEase’s two e-commerce platforms, Kaola.com and Yanxuan, which were established in January
2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services,
e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the
manner in which the Company’s operating decision maker (“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial
information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment
presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated
statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform
to current period presentation.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB736.6 million (US$113.2 million) for the fourth quarter of

2017, compared to RMB1,067.2 million and RMB783.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth
quarter of 2016, respectively.

Gross Profit/ (Loss)

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB5,744.6 million (US$882.9 million), compared to
RMB5,947.6 million and RMB6,463.3 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016,
respectively.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in online game services gross profit were primarily due
to decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such as Onmyoji.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in e-commerce gross profit were primarily due to the
rapid development of Kaola.com and Yanxuan.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily due
to NetEase’s enhanced monetization efforts and better economies of scale.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in e-mail and others gross profit were primarily due to
decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher margins,
as well as the one-off recognition of expense related to certain copyrights in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gross Profit/ (Loss) Margin

Gross profit margin for online game services for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 61.4%, compared to 62.5%
and 60.7% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase
in gross profit margin was mainly due to the one-off recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed
games in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was partially offset by increased staff-related costs. The quarter-
over-quarter decrease in gross profit margins was mainly due to increased staff-related costs.

Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7.4%, compared to 11.5% and 12.5%
for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-
quarter decreases in e-commerce gross profit margin were primarily due to the larger-scale promotions and
certain sales discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017, such as Singles Day on November 11, 2017.

Gross profit margin for advertising services for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 71.2%, compared to 68.0% and
66.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-



	                                                     4
over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to NetEase’s enhanced monetization efforts and
better economies of scale.

Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.3%, compared to gross profit
margin of 13.1% and 46.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-
over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margin were primarily due to the decreased revenue
contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as
well as the one-off recognition of expense related to certain copyrights in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB4,317.8 million (US$663.6 million),
compared to RMB3,397.9 million and RMB2,596.6 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly
due to increased selling and marketing expenses and research and development investments, and higher staff-
related costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to NetEase’s e-commerce businesses. Shipping
and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB393.3
million (US$60.4 million), compared to RMB294.8 million and RMB177.2 million for the preceding quarter
and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB290.4 million (US$44.6 million) for the fourth
quarter of 2017, compared to RMB225.5 million and RMB882.0 million for the preceding quarter and the
fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.2%, compared
to 8.1% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The changes in the
effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key
Software Enterprises in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10%
for 2016. The Company recognized related tax credits in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017
accordingly.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.3 billion
(US$197.6 million), compared to RMB2.5 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth

(US$24.5 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB109.9 million and a net foreign exchange
gain of RMB90.5 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-

	                                                     5
exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term

On November 15, 2016, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase
program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months.
As of November 14, 2017, the last day of such program, the Company had repurchased approximately 1.1
million ADSs for approximately US$306.1 million under this program.

On November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors has approved a new share
repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12
months beginning on November 16, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, no ADS were repurchased under this
program.

Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in
open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase
transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is
also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.
The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market
conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase’s
management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial
statements and related notes to be included in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
December 31, 2017 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been
completed, the Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the
end of fiscal year 2017.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could
result in significant differences between the Company’s audited financial statements and this preliminary
unaudited financial information.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these
forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by
a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to
grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for
example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not
become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile
internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a
positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase’s affiliates will not be able to continue
operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls™, Heroes
of the Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible
governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline;
competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and
services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased
advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online
services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce
businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses
in future periods; competition in NetEase’s existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties
(including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates
and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general
competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi
with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase’s business and financial results; and other risks
outlined in NetEase’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any
obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term
investment of available-for-sale securities. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders
enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based


	                                                    10
compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities, which are
non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to
investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects
in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-
GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term
investment of available-for-sale securities have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are
not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In
addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by
other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.

           *In 2017, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2015-17 issued by FASB in November 2015, which requires entities to
           present deferred tax assets ("DTA") and deferred tax liabilities ("DTL") as non-current in the balance sheets. Pursuant to the
           guidance, the Company retrospectively reclassified current DTA and current DTL to non-current assets and to non-current
           liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
