year-over-year increase was primarily due to business development from its learning services.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share
and per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and
formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the
same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-
GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.



                                                    11
Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools.
One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of income / expense that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-
GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their
comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its
financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Note 3: The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit
of the financial statements and related notes to be included in the Company’s annual report to
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit
of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the Company makes no representation as to
the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the end of fiscal year 2021.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which
could result in significant differences between the Company’s audited financial statements and this
preliminary unaudited financial information.

Note 4: The financial information prepared and presented in this announcement might be different
from those published and to be published by NetEase’s listed subsidiaries to meet the disclosure
requirements under U.S. GAAP or different accounting standards requirement.
