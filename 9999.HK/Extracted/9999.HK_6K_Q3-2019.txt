NetEase Reports Third Quarter 2019 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing - November 20, 2019) - NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) (“NetEase” or the “Company”), one of
China’s leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results
for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.

Third Quarter 2019 Financial Highlights[1]
      •   Net revenues[2] were RMB14,635.7 million (US$2,047.6 million), an increase of 11.2% compared to
          the third quarter of 2018.
          •   Online game services net revenues were RMB11,534.8 million (US$1,613.8 million), an increase
              of 11.5% compared to the third quarter of 2018.

          •   Youdao net revenues were RMB345.9 million (US$48.4 million), an increase of 98.4% compared

[1]In September 2019, NetEase sold its Kaola e-commerce business, the principal terms of which were
previously announced. As a result, Kaola has been deconsolidated from the Company and its historical
financial results are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations
accordingly. The financial information and non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this press release is
presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise specifically stated.

[2] Effective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed its segment disclosure to add the financial
results of its certain advertising services and its private label e-commerce business Yanxuan into “innovative
businesses and others” in light of the relatively small revenue contribution from those businesses to the
Company’s total consolidated net revenues in 2019. In addition, the Company has commenced separately
reporting the results of Youdao. As a result, the Company now reports segments as online game services,
Youdao and innovative businesses and others. See “Change of segment reporting” in this press release.

[3]As used in this press release, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS

“During our eventful third quarter, we realized value for our shareholders across our business lines. On a year-
over-year basis, we achieved solid growth in net revenues of 11% and non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations of 74%. In recognition of this success, our board of directors has approved a dividend of US$7.59
per ADS for the third quarter,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Our
main areas of investment are online games, online education, music and private label e-commerce. With the
completion of Youdao’s IPO, we will continue to invest in knowledge tools, online courses and smart devices
to empower even more efficient learning in China.
“Online games remain the cornerstone of our business with steady growth from our existing titles and exciting
new titles in China and globally. Our flagship title Fantasy Westward Journey Online reached new record high
gross billings this quarter. We also advanced our international brand with more hit titles such as Knives Out,
Identity V and Life-After in Japan. Going forward, we will continue to focus on the growth of our robust online
games business worldwide, as well as create additional value among our evolving businesses rooted in
education, music and e-commerce,” Mr. Ding concluded.

                                                       3
The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net
revenues from certain PC-client games. The year-over-year increase in online game services gross profit was
primarily due to increased net revenues from mobile games such as Life-After, Invincible and Identity V.

The year-over-year increase in Youdao gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from its
learning services and products, which in turn was driven by an increased number of paid student enrollments.

The year-over-year decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased
net revenues from certain advertising services which were affected by the macro-environment and increased
expenses related to staff cost and content purchases.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2019 was 63.8%, compared to 63.1% and
65.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in
gross profit margin was mainly due to higher revenue contribution from mobile games with comparatively
lower margin.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2019 was 25.8%, compared to 32.9% and 23.3% for
the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao
gross profit margin was mainly driven by a lower gross margin for its online marketing services.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2019 was 15.2%, compared to
15.5% and 17.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased net revenues
from certain advertising services which were affected by the macro-environment and increased expenses
related to staff cost and content purchases.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were RMB4,535.6 million (US$634.6 million),
compared to RMB4,012.5 million and RMB4,688.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased
marketing expenditures related to online game services and Youdao, as well as increased staff-related costs.
The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to decreased marketing expenditures
related to online games.

Other Income

Other income consisted of investment (loss)/ income, interest income, foreign exchange gains and others. The
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in other income were mainly due to the gain from the
disposal of Kaola and investment income.




                                                      4
Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,116.7 million (US$156.2 million) for the third
quarter of 2019, compared to RMB683.8 million and RMB842.9 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 8.0%, compared to
16.7% and 28.8% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate
represents certain estimates by the Company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each
quarter, and the rate for the third quarter was affected by a number of factors including certain tax credits
received and recognized in the quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the third quarter of
2019 totaled RMB12,885.4 million (US$1,802.7 million), compared to RMB3,354.2 million and RMB2,062.7
million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively. Non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled
RMB4,726.0 million (US$661.2 million), compared to RMB3,921.1 million and RMB2,712.3 million for the
preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.

quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS were US$5.12

from continuing operations per ADS of US$4.26 and US$4.22, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and
non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per ADS of US$2.95 and US$2.94,
respectively, for the third quarter of 2018.

Quarterly Dividend

approved a dividend of US$7.59 per ADS for the third quarter of 2019. Such amount includes a regular

attributable to the Company’s shareholders), plus a special dividend of US$3.45 per ADS. The total dividend
of approximately US$1.0 billion is expected to be paid on December 13, 2019 to shareholders of record as of
the close of business on December 6, 2019.

                                                      5
Starting in the second quarter of 2019, the Company’s policy has been to set quarterly dividends at an amount
equivalent to approximately 20%-30% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any
particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the
Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Other Information

As of September 30, 2019, the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time
deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB61,431.7 million (US$8,594.6 million), compared to
RMB49,663.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Cash flow generated from continuing operating activities was
RMB3,846.3 million (US$538.1 million) for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RMB4,928.1 million and
RMB4,491.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2018, respectively.

Share Repurchase/ Purchase Program

On November 14, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase
program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on November 16, 2018. As of November 15, 2019, the last day of such program, approximately
1,000 ADSs had been repurchased under this program.

The Company also announced today that its board of directors has approved a share purchase program of up
to US$20.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on
November 25, 2019.

Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao’s ADSs in open-market transactions on the
New York Stock Exchange. It is expected that the timing and dollar amount of purchase transactions will be in
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements and such
purchases may be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The extent to which
NetEase purchases Youdao’s ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions. This
purchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

                                                      6
Change in Segment Reporting

Effective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed its segment disclosure to add the financial results
of its certain advertising services and Yanxuan into innovative businesses and others in light of the relatively
small revenue contribution from those businesses to the Company’s total consolidated net revenues in 2019.
The Company sold its Kaola e-commerce business in September 2019. In addition, the Company has
commenced separately reporting the results of its majority-controlled subsidiary Youdao, Inc. which
completed its initial public offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2019. As a result,
the Company now reports segments as online game services, Youdao and innovative businesses and others.
This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company’s operating decision maker
(“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the
performance of reporting segments. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to
conform to current period presentation.

Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncement

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases” as amended, which generally requires lessees to
recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet
and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified
retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately
RMB577.0 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its
consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, excluding the impact from disposal of Kaola. The Company
recognized RMB441.1 million and RMB449.8 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities,
respectively, for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. Right-of-use
assets are included in other long-term assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other
payables and other long-term payables, respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance
sheet. Other than the foregoing, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on
the net assets of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these
forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by
a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to
grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market within China or globally,
which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its
existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to effectively
market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the market for online games, education products and services
and e-commerce may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline; the risk that
NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be
able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the risk that the e-commerce market or the
internet advertising market in China will not grow and will remain subject to intense competition; the risk that
NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase’s existing and
potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable
to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from
continuing operations per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance
and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding
share-based compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus.
Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables
NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based
compensation expenses and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus, which are non-
cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance
and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of
this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it
does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
and net gain from disposal of business due to change in business focus have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase
uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and
therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which
should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-
GAAP Results” at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in
its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
