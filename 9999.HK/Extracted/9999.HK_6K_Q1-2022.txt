compared with RMB8,309.6 million and RMB6,777.1 million for the preceding quarter and the first

are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its

in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from

continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; the risk that COVID-19 or other health risks in China or globally could adversely affect the

strategies and its ability to implement such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its
operations and business; competition for, among other things, capital, technology and skilled
personnel; potential changes in government regulation that could adversely affect the industry and
geographical markets in which NetEase operates, including, among others, initiatives to enhance
supervision of companies listed on an overseas stock exchange and tighten scrutiny over data privacy
and data security, as well as the risk that NetEase’s ADSs could be barred from trading in the United

                                                    8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share and per ADS,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess
its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of income / expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its
financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
