compared with RMB20,524.5 million and RMB18,658.2 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2020, respectively.

2021, compared with 72.1% and 72.7% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2020,
respectively.

2021, compared with RMB1,293.4 million and RMB896.0 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2020, respectively.

for the third quarter of 2021, compared with RMB4,703.0 million and RMB3,900.1 million for the
preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2020, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2021 was RMB11,810.8 million (US$1,833.0 million), compared
with RMB11,189.6 million and RMB9,885.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2020, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in online game services gross profit were
primarily due to increased net revenues resulting from the launch of new games such as Naraka:

                                                  3
Bladepoint and Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, as well as from existing games such as Fantasy
Westward Journey Online and Westward Journey Online II.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Youdao gross profit were primarily
attributable to the significant increase in net revenues from improved economies of scale and faculty
compensation structure optimization for its learning services.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due
to decreased gross profit from NetEase CC and other services. The year-over-year increase was
primarily due to the increased net revenues from and improved cost control at NetEase Cloud Music.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2021 was 64.5%, compared with
66.1% and 63.6% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2020, respectively. Gross profit
margin for online game services generally fluctuates within a narrow band based on the revenue mix
of mobile and PC games, as well as NetEase’s self-developed and licensed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2021 was 56.6%, compared with 52.3% and
45.9% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2020, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year increases were primarily attributable to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2021 was 15.6%,
compared with 19.3% and 16.8% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2020, respectively.
The fluctuation of gross profit margin is influenced by revenue contributions of different businesses
and their respective gross profit margin.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were RMB8,035.6 million (US$1,247.1
million), compared with RMB7,431.5 million and RMB7,015.7 million for the preceding quarter and
the third quarter of 2020, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were
mainly due to higher staff-related costs and research and development investments.

Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) comprised investment income/ (loss), interest income, exchange (losses)/
gains and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes were mainly due to
investment income/ (loss) arising from fair value changes of equity investments with readily
determinable fair value and unrealized net exchange (losses)/ gains arising from the Company’s U.S.
dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S.
dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its

results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that
the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its

industries and geographical markets in which NetEase and its subsidiaries operate, including, among
others, recently announced government initiatives to enhance supervision of overseas-listed, China-
based companies and increase scrutiny of data security and cross-border data flow, as well as recent
guidelines restricting certain activities in China’s education market; the risk that COVID-19 or other
health risks in China or globally could adversely affect the Company’s operations or financial
results; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; the risk that NetEase may not be able

                                                    8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS
and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and
formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the
same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-
GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools.
One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-
GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their
comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its
financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
