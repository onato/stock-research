RMB16.5 billion and RMB16.8 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2023,
respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in games and related value-added services’
gross profit were primarily due to decreased net revenues from certain mobile games, partially offset
by increased net revenues from PC games, including certain licensed titles.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in Youdao’s gross profit were primarily due to
decreased net revenues from its learning services.

decreased net revenues from social entertainment services.

to increased gross profit from Yanxuan and advertising services. The year-over-year decrease was
primarily due to decreased gross profit from several businesses within the segment including
advertising services.

66.7%, compared with 68.8% and 69.5% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2023,

revenue contribution from licensed games which have comparatively lower gross profit margins.

49.9% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2023, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter

continued improvement in cost control measures.

compared with 37.8% and 34.4% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2023, respectively.

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were RMB8.5 billion (US$1.2 billion),
compared with RMB9.3 billion and RMB10.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter
of 2023, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to
decreased marketing expenditures related to games and related value-added services.

Other Income/(Expenses)

Other income/(expenses) consisted of investment (losses)/income, interest income, exchange
gains/(losses) and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to
net exchange gains in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with net exchange losses recorded in the
preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2023.

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1.4 billion (US$189.7 million) for the fourth

accounted for approximately 72.7% of net revenues from the operation of online games for fiscal year

contribution from its learning services, which was partially offset by increased revenue contribution

Forward Looking Statements

This announcement contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under
the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can
identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar expressions. In addition, statements
that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its
expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management
in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online games market will not
continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,

                                                    9
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in regulation
environment in the markets where NetEase operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to
continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow
in a timely manner, trends in the market; risks related to evolving economic cycles and geopolitical
events; risks related to the expansion of NetEase’s businesses and operations internationally; risks
associated with cybersecurity threats or incidents; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
that could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results. Further information regarding
these and other risks is included in NetEase’s filings with the SEC and announcements on the website
of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-
looking information, except as required under applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See the unaudited reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
