Gross Profit

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB13,244.4 million (US$1,920.3 million), compared
with RMB13,743.9 million and RMB12,917.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter
of 2021, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in games and related value-added services’
gross profit were primarily due to the one-off recognition of royalty fees related to certain licensed
games.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Youdao’s gross profit were primarily
attributable to increased revenue contribution from its smart devices and online marketing services.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music’s gross profit were primarily
due to increased net revenues from its online music services and its social entertainment services, as
well as continuously improved cost control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in innovative businesses and others’ gross profit
were primarily due to increased gross profit contribution from Yanxuan.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the fourth quarter of 2022 was
59.1%, compared with 65.0% and 60.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021,
respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were primarily attributable to the
one-off recognition of royalty fees related to certain licensed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 53.3%, compared with 54.2% and
50.7% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. The slight quarter-over-
quarter decrease was mainly due to higher revenue contribution from sales of smart devices, which
carry a lower gross profit margin than learning services. The year-over-year increase was mainly due
to improved gross margin from the sale of smart devices.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music was 17.8% for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with 14.2%
and 4.1% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above.

compared with 25.5% and 30.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to margin improvement from Yanxuan and
advertising services. The slight year-over-year increase was mainly due to margin improvement from
Yanxuan, which was partially offset by decreased margin from advertising services.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 were RMB8,810.9 million (US$1,277.5
million), compared with RMB9,002.1 million and RMB8,309.6 million for the preceding quarter and
the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased
marketing expenditures related to games and related value-added services and Youdao. The year-over-
year increase was mainly due to higher staff-related costs and marketing expenditures.

Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment income/ (loss), interest income, exchange (losses)/
gains and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in other income were mainly
due to lower investment income from equity investments and higher unrealized net exchange losses
from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and loans balances as the exchange rate
of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated during the periods.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB966.6 million (US$140.1 million) for the
fourth quarter of 2022, compared with RMB1,586.7 million and RMB934.0 million for the preceding
quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of
2022 was 20.2%, compared with 19.3% and 14.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2021, respectively. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax
obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

million) for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with RMB6,699.4 million and RMB5,694.2 million
for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.

2022, compared with US$0.30 per share (US$1.49 per ADS) and US$0.25 per share (US$1.26 per
ADS) for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.

games accounted for approximately 67.0% of net revenues from the operation of online games for
fiscal year 2022, compared with 70.4% for fiscal year 2021. The lower percentage contribution from
mobile games was mainly due to a higher proportion of net revenues generated by PC games such as
Fantasy Westward Journey Online and Naraka: Bladepoint, although the total amount of net revenues
from mobile games also increased in 2022 compared to the prior year.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB5,013.2 million (US$726.8 million) for fiscal year 2022,

to increased net revenues from the operation of online games, including PC games such as Fantasy
Westward Journey Online and Naraka: Bladepoint and mobile games such as certain newly launched
games and existing hit titles like Infinite Lagrange.

The year-over-year decrease in Youdao gross profit was mainly due to the conclusion of its after-school
tutoring services for academic subjects under China’s compulsory education system, which was
partially offset by increased revenue contribution from its new services and products.

The year-over-year increase in Cloud Music gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net
revenues, mainly from its social entertainment services, as well as improved cost control.

The slight year-over-year decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due
to decreased gross profit from the Company’s advertising business, which was partially offset by
increased gross profits from Yanxuan.

compared with RMB30,553.7 million for fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily
due to higher staff-related costs and marketing expenditures mainly for games and related value-added
services, as well as Cloud Music and Yanxuan.

changes of equity investments with readily determinable fair value, which was partially offset by higher
unrealized net exchange gains, interest income and others.

year 2022, compared with RMB4,128.3 million for fiscal year 2021. The effective tax rate was 20.7%

applicable law.


Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted
net income from continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing
and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders
excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating
results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial
measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable
to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore
their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure,
