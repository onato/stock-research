                    NetEase Reports Third Quarter 2016 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing - November 9, 2016) - NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) (“NetEase” or the “Company”), one of
China’s leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results
for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016.

“We maintained steady growth across each of our primary business lines in the third quarter with a continued
focus on providing first-rate games and products to the expanding online market, both domestically and
abroad,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Led by our online game
services segment, our total net revenues increased 38.1% year-over-year with growth of 26.0% in online
games services, 23.8% in advertising services, and 107.2% in our e-mail, e-commerce and others segment.”

“Ingenuity, quality and diversification have provided the cornerstones for our competitive edge. As the
internet technology industry expands, we will keep pushing the boundaries with new and improved products.
Our latest endeavors for our online game services include enhancing interactive communications among our
mobile users, establishing virtual and augmented reality interfaces, as well as exploring other innovative
gameplay options that offer exciting advances in how players experience and connect with our games.”

“There remains extensive opportunity in the thriving mobile game industry where we continue to introduce
chart-topping games. During the third quarter we released a number of new games to add to our mobile
portfolio that spans over 100 titles. Our latest mobile 3D game Onmyoji was an instant success, surpassing our
expectations. Onmyoji quickly became one of the top-grossing games in China’s iOS app store for both the
iPhone and iPad following its release in early September. Our Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward
Journey Online mobile games and the mobile version of New Ghost also remained popular in the third quarter.
Additionally, we launched mobile games such as Tianxia III mobile, OverOcean and Audition Mobile in the
third quarter, followed by HIT, a stunning new ARPG, in October, and are planning to bring our mobile
players exciting, original titles in the near-term with games such as Heroes of Tang Dynasty Mobile, Demon
Seals Mobile and Land of Glory.”




                                                      1
“Our classic PC-client games also maintained a steady presence in the third quarter with the launch of new
expansion packs for games including Fantasy Westward Journey Online (formerly named Fantasy Westward
Journey II), New Westward Journey Online II, New Westward Journey Online III, Heroes of Tang Dynasty
Zero, Revelation and New Ghost. New expansion packs for Kung Fu Master II and Demon Seals were also
recently released. In the coming months we plan to launch new expansion packs for games including Tianxia
III and Heroes of Tang Dynasty Zero.”

“Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch® and Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™ with its new adventure: One
Night in Karazhan™, continued to gain favor among Chinese audiences in the third quarter, demonstrating the
universal strength of these world renowned brands. Similarly, the latest expansion pack for Blizzard’s World
of Warcraft®, Legion™, has garnered considerable attention from players in China, surpassing our expectations
since its September 1 release in mainland China.”

“Supported by our industry leading Mobile News App and diversified mobile products, as well as high profile
events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics, we are creating attractive options for our advertising partners. In
the third quarter, our advertising services revenues grew sequentially and year-over-year with the automobile,
internet services and telecommunications sectors as our top performing verticals. Additionally, our Kaola.com
e-commerce offering continues to grow at a healthy pace. While our primary focus is on direct merchandise
sales, we also look forward to maximizing the value of complementary services that extend the reach of this
platform.”

 “We believe that there remain significant growth opportunities for NetEase. By utilizing the strength of our
experience as industry veterans and our strong R&D capabilities, our products and services continue to evolve
and help shape the market. With an eye toward innovation, we build this value across our businesses not only
for our players, but for all of our customers, partners and investors,” Mr. Ding concluded.

Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were RMB9,211.6 million (US$1,381.4 million), compared to
RMB8,952.8 million and RMB6,671.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB6,568.0 million (US$984.9 million) for the third quarter of 2016,
compared to RMB6,438.3 million and RMB5,212.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2015, respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB563.3 million (US$84.5 million) for the third quarter of
2016, compared to RMB531.1 million and RMB454.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2015, respectively.




                                                      2
Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB2,080.4 million (US$312.0 million) for the third
quarter of 2016, compared to RMB1,983.4 million and RMB1,004.0 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2015, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 was RMB5,333.6 million (US$799.8 million), compared to
RMB5,280.4 million and RMB3,849.3 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenue
contribution from mobile games such as the Westward Journey Online mobile game, the mobile version of
New Ghost and Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch and World of Warcraft.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily
attributable to strong demand from advertisers and NetEase’s monetization efforts for its mobile applications,
primarily its Mobile News App.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was
primarily due to increased revenue contribution from NetEase’s e-commerce business.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the third quarter of 2016 was 65.0%, compared to 66.2%
and 67.9% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in
gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games and licensed games,
which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online games revenues.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution
from licensed games.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the third quarter of 2016 was 65.3%, compared to
65.5% and 67.6% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase costs.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the third quarter of 2016 was 33.5%,
compared to 33.8% and 0.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-
over-year increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the business development and the gross
profit margin improvement of NetEase’s certain e-commerce businesses.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were RMB2,487.0 million (US$372.9 million),
compared to RMB2,232.5 million and RMB1,761.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2015, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly


                                                      3
due to higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount, average compensation, research and
development investments and selling and marketing expenses.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB427.2 million (US$64.1 million) for the third quarter
of 2016, compared to RMB262.7 million and RMB399.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 13.3%, compared to 8.6%
and 17.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the
Company were approved as Key Software Enterprises in the second quarter of 2016 and subject to a
preferential tax rate of 10% for 2015. The Company recognized the related tax credits in the second and third
quarters of 2016. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations
and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the third quarter of 2016 totaled RMB2.7 billion
(US$410.9 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and RMB1.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2015, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders[1] for the
third quarter of 2016 totaled RMB3.0 billion (US$452.5 million), compared to RMB3.2 billion and RMB2.1
billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB14.8 million (US$2.2
million), compared to net foreign exchange gains of RMB77.3 million and RMB66.5 million for the preceding
quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively. The net foreign exchange gains were mainly due to
unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and
short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.13 and US$3.11, respectively, for the third
quarter of 2016. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.11 and US$3.09,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.15 and US$2.13,
respectively, for the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$3.45 and
US$3.42, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per
ADS of US$3.68 and US$3.66, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted
earnings per ADS of US$2.34 and US$2.32, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015.

particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the
Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Other Information

(US$559.3 million) for the third quarter of 2016, compared to RMB3.3 billion and RMB2.2 billion for the
preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2015, respectively.

the last day of such program, the Company had repurchased approximately 1.5 million ADSs for
approximately US$205.3 million under this program.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on investment.
Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess
its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and impairment on
investment, which are non-cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP
financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s
current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose.
NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its
operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on investment have
been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP
net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures
NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies,
and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
