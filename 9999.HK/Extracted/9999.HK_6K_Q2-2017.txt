                                                                        1
Second Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights

•   Further expanded global footprint with Onmyoji, achieving record high downloads in Japan and Southeast
    Asia.
•   Launched new mobile titles including Land of Glory and Treasure Hunter, both of which were well
    received by players in China.
•   Many legacy titles continued to increase in popularity among players with PC-client game Fantasy
    Westward Journey Online and mobile game Invincible reaching record high quarterly revenues.


“Our total net revenues grew nearly 50% in the second quarter compared with last year as we continued to
invest in new content development that broadens our offering and engages our community across our business
lines,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Our online games,
advertising services and e-commerce divisions continue to grow. While e-commerce is becoming an
increasingly important revenue contributor, our self-developed mobile games remain our primary growth
engine. During the second quarter, many legacy titles maintained their popularity, while our instant hit title
Onmyoji had a natural ebb and flow. To bolster the power of this game’s IP, we recently commenced
dedicated brand expansion initiatives, and our international launch strategy is progressing well. ”

“Additional penetration in China’s mobile market, as well as overseas markets, offers considerable room for
NetEase’s ever-increasing portfolio, particularly as we introduce new gameplay options and genres that
diversify and strengthen our offering. We have an exciting pipeline of upcoming games, including the highly
anticipated sandbox game Minecraft, as well as Index and Forever 7, two stunning Japanese-themed RPGs.
From our time-honored online games and advertising services, to our flourishing Kaola.com and Yanxuan e-
commerce divisions, we will look to further strengthen our portfolio and top-quality internet services that
propel our business forward,” Mr. Ding concluded.



Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the second quarter of 2017 were RMB13,376.0 million (US$1,973.1 million), compared to
RMB13,640.5 million and RMB8,952.8 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB9,430.2 million (US$1,391.0 million) for the second quarter of
2017, compared to RMB10,735.5 million and RMB6,438.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second
quarter of 2016, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 72.4% of net revenues from online
games in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 73.3% and 61.3% for the preceding quarter and the second
quarter of 2016, respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB595.6 million (US$87.9 million) for the second quarter of
2017, compared to RMB445.2 million and RMB531.1 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter
of 2016, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the second quarter of 2017 were automobile,
internet services and real estate.

                                                      2
Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB3,350.3 million (US$494.2 million) for the
second quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2,459.9 million and RMB1,983.4 million for the preceding quarter
and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2017 was RMB6,736.9 million (US$993.7 million), compared to
RMB7,483.6 million and RMB5,280.4 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from
mobile games such as Onmyoji and the mobile version of New Ghost. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in
online games gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from mobile games.

The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to NetEase’s enhanced
monetization efforts. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due
to seasonality.

The year-over-year decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased
revenue contribution from certain e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the second quarter of 2017 was 63.1%, compared to
63.9% and 66.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games, which
have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online games net revenues.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the second quarter of 2017 was 67.6%, compared
to 57.3% and 65.5% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year
increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to NetEase’s enhanced monetization efforts. The quarter-over-
quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others businesses for the second quarter of 2017 was
11.3%, compared to 14.8% and 33.8% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.
The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in gross profit margin were primarily attributable to
changes in NetEase’s e-commerce business mix.




                                                      3
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2017 were RMB3,331.5 million (US$491.4 million),
compared to RMB2,711.7 million and RMB2,232.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly
due to higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation, increased
selling and marketing expenses mainly related to online games, and operating expenses related to NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB703.5 million (US$103.8 million) for the second
quarter of 2017, compared to RMB943.0 million and RMB262.7 million for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 19.0%,
compared to 19.0% and 8.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-
over-year increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company
were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the second quarter of 2016 and subject to a preferential tax
rate of 10% for 2015, and the Company recognized related tax credits in the second quarter of 2016. The
effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable
to it in each quarter.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.0 billion
(US$438.4 million), compared to RMB3.9 billion and RMB2.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for
the second quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.5 billion (US$512.2 million), compared to RMB4.3 billion and
RMB3.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2017, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB131.3 million
(US$19.4 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB48.5 million and a net foreign exchange
gain of RMB77.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-
over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to
unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and
short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.33 and US$3.31, respectively, for the second
quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.40 and US$4.36,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.06 and US$3.04,
respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$3.89
and US$3.86, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings
per ADS of US$4.86 and US$4.82, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted
earnings per ADS of US$3.62 and US$3.60, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016.



                                                       4

forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by
a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to
grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for
example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not
become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile
internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a
positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue
operating World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls™, Heroes of the
Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible
governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline;
competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and
services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased
advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online
services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce
businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses

obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and certain impairment on
investment. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s
management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation
expenses and certain impairment on investment, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the
Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if
they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and certain impairment on investment
have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures
NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies,
and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.

*In 2017, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2015-17 issued by FASB in November 2015, which requires entities to present
deferred tax assets ("DTA") and deferred tax liabilities ("DTL") as non-current in the balance sheets. Pursuant to the guidance, the
Company retrospectively reclassified current DTA and current DTL to non-current assets and to non-current liabilities, respectively,
in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
