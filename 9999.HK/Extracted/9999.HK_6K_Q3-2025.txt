Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2025 were RMB28.4 billion (US$4.0 billion), compared with
RMB27.9 billion and RMB26.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB23.3 billion (US$3.3 billion) for
the third quarter of 2025, compared with RMB22.8 billion and RMB20.9 billion for the preceding
quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Net revenues from the operation of online games
accounted for approximately 97.6% of the segment’s net revenues for the third quarter of 2025,
compared with 97.1% and 96.8% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in online games net revenues was due to higher net revenues from
self-developed games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online and Sword of Justice, as well as
certain licensed games. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net revenues from self-
developed games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online, Eggy Party and newly-launched Where
Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals, as well as certain licensed games.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1.6 billion (US$228.8 million) for the third quarter of 2025,
compared with RMB1.4 billion and RMB1.6 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of
2024. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due to increased net revenues from its smart devices and
online marketing services.

Net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music were RMB2.0 billion (US$275.9 million) for the third quarter
of 2025, compared with RMB2.0 billion each for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1.4 billion (US$202.1 million) for the
third quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.7 billion and RMB1.8 billion for the preceding quarter
and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Results from this segment were mainly driven by net
revenues from Yanxuan, advertising services and other value-added services, as well as certain inter-
segment transaction eliminations. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was led by decreased net revenues
from Yanxuan. The year-over-year decrease reflected an increase in certain inter-segment transaction
elimination and, to a lesser extent, decreased net revenues from Yanxuan and certain other businesses.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues for the third quarter of 2025 was RMB10.2 billion (US$1.4 billion), compared with
RMB9.8 billion and RMB9.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively. Staff-related costs, revenue sharing costs and royalties for licensed games increased
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.

compared with the same quarter of 2024.

This announcement contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under
the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can
identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar expressions. In addition, statements
that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its
expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management
in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online games market will not
continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in regulatory
environment in the markets where NetEase operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to

                                                    7
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See the unaudited reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
