                   NetEase Reports Second Quarter 2016 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing - August 17, 2016) - NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) (“NetEase” or the “Company”), one of
China’s leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results
for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.

“Our outstanding second quarter results reflect NetEase’s leadership in China’s dynamic online games
industry where we continue to introduce premium game content, innovative technology and effective
marketing strategies,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Our total
second quarter net revenues grew 96.0% compared with the second quarter of 2015, with each business
segment posting impressive year-over-year improvement, including increases of 76.0% in online game
services, 24.2% in advertising services, and 310.6% in our e-mail, e-commerce and others business.”

“As we focus on delivering the highest quality games and unmatched user experiences, we also move the
industry forward by exploring new technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality and developing
content for a variety of genres.”

“Our business and the overall online games industry are being driven by the popularity and demand for mobile
games. We are well positioned to exploit this trend with a mobile game portfolio that now includes more than
100 titles. In the second quarter, we launched the mobile version of New Ghost, which ranked as a top 10
grossing title on China’s iOS app store, and Fantasy Westward Journey: Warriors and Raven, Korea’s top
ARPG, also quickly attracted large audiences following their introductions in the second quarter. Two of our
best-selling mobile games, the Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey mobile games, maintained
their popularity on China’s iOS app store throughout the second quarter. Our other mobile games, such as
Invincible and Kai-ri-sei Million Arthur, also made solid contributions to our second quarter year-over-year
growth.”

“In addition to the launch of the well-received 3D Tianxia III mobile on July 29, our new mobile game
releases planned for the next several months include the 3D RPG Onmyoji, Audition Mobile, the mobile
version of a popular dancing game, and HIT, a breathtaking ARPG.”

	                                                   1	  
“We launched several new expansion packs and new versions for a number of our highly popular PC-client
games in the second quarter including New Ghost, Tianxia III, Demon Seals, Kung Fu Master II and
Revelation, which gained players’ attention. New expansion packs for Fantasy Westward Journey II, New
Westward Journey Online II, New Westward Journey Online III and Heroes of Tang Dynasty Zero were also
released more recently. The new expansion packs for Revelation and New Ghost will be released on August 18
and August 19, respectively. We also look forward to preparing for the first closed beta testing of our real-time
action tactic thriller War Rage. I am also pleased with the ongoing development of the Chinese version of
Minecraft. Our cooperation with Microsoft and Mojang AB, the creator of Minecraft, reflects NetEase’s deep
understanding of the Chinese market and ability to successfully launch the most renowned PC-client and
mobile games.”

“On May 24 we brought Blizzard Entertainment’s highly anticipated team-based first-person shooter game,
Overwatch®, to players in China in conjunction with its global launch. Following the release, Overwatch has
received unprecedented attention and praise from the online players’ community. It surpassed the sales record
established last year by Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls™ in the category of buy-to-play
PC-client games in China, with nearly 3 million copies sold by the end of June. In addition, Blizzard
Entertainment’s Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™ achieved new records for revenues and the number of
active players in the second quarter, following the April release of its third expansion pack, Whisper of the Old
Gods™.”

“Led by the automobile, internet services and real estate sectors, advertising revenue achieved another quarter
of solid growth. We continued to promote our Mobile News App live streaming services and further invested in
high quality content and simultaneously, we launched our NetEase Media Platform to broaden our
Professionally Generated Content (PGC) platform, all of which we hope will attract additional advertisers and
enlarge the user base. In addition, our cross-border e-commerce platform, Kaola.com, sustained its strong
revenue and gross profit margin growth through the second quarter and is creating exciting strategic
partnership opportunities.”


“China is now the world’s largest online game market, providing NetEase an opportunity to further expand its
loyal customer base, develop new strategic business partnerships and enhance its industry leadership position.
Our progress in the first half of 2016 clearly demonstrates that we have the resources and commitment to
continue the exceptional growth and success of each of our business segments,” Mr. Ding concluded.

Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were RMB8,952.8 million (US$1,347.1 million), compared to
RMB7,915.4 million and RMB4,567.9 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB6,438.3 million (US$968.8 million) for the second quarter of 2016,
compared to RMB6,015.1 million and RMB3,657.1 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2015, respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB531.1 million (US$79.9 million) for the second quarter of
2016, compared to RMB393.2 million and RMB427.7 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter
of 2015, respectively.

Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB1,983.4 million (US$298.4 million) for the
second quarter of 2016, compared to RMB1,507.1 million and RMB483.0 million for the preceding quarter
and the second quarter of 2015, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2016 was RMB5,280.4 million (US$794.5 million), compared to
RMB4,586.6 million and RMB2,845.6 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from
mobile games such as the Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey Online mobile games, Invincible,
and Blizzard Entertainment’s Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft and Overwatch. The quarter-over-quarter
increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from Blizzard
Entertainment’s Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft and Overwatch, as well as the Fantasy Westward Journey
mobile game.

The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily attributable to strong demand
from the automobile, internet services and real estate services sectors, and NetEase’s monetization efforts for
its mobile applications, primarily its Mobile News App. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising
services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was
primarily due to increased revenue contribution from NetEase’s e-commerce businesses such as Kaola.com
and other e-commerce products.




	                                                    3	  
Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the second quarter of 2016 was 66.2%, compared to
67.1% and 69.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games, which
have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online games revenues.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the second quarter of 2016 was 65.5%, compared
to 62.4% and 68.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in
headcount and average compensation. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due
to seasonality.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%,
compared to 20.4% and 4.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-
over-year and the quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the
gross profit margin growth from NetEase’s e-commerce businesses such as Kaola.com, as well as the
continued shift in business strategy from direct merchandise sales to focus on providing platform services for
certain e-commerce businesses.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were RMB2,232.5 million (US$335.9 million),
compared to RMB1,718.9 million and RMB1,395.2 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2015, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses was mainly
due to higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation, increased
research and development investments and selling and marketing expenses, as well as increased operating
expenses related to Kaola.com.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB262.7 million (US$39.5 million) for the second
quarter of 2016, compared to RMB530.7 million and RMB145.9 million for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 8.6%,
compared to 17.5% and 9.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The
quarter-over-quarter decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the
Company were approved as Key Software Enterprises in the second quarter of 2016 and subject to a
preferential tax rate of 10% for 2015, and the Company recognized related tax credits in this quarter. The
effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable
to it in each quarter.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the second quarter of 2016 totaled RMB2.7 billion
(US$409.4 million), compared to RMB2.5 billion and RMB1.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2015, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders[1] for
the second quarter of 2016 totaled RMB3.2 billion (US$484.6 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and
RMB1.6 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB77.3 million
(US$11.6 million), compared to net foreign exchange losses of RMB36.0 million and RMB21.7 million for
the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-
quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses
arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.12 and US$3.10, respectively, for the second
quarter of 2016. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.81 and US$2.79,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.63 and US$1.62,
respectively, for the second quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were	   US$3.70
and US$3.67,	  respectively, for the second quarter of 2016, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings
per ADS of US$3.05 and US$3.03, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted
earnings per ADS of US$1.82 and US$1.81, respectively, for the second quarter of 2015.

Quarterly Dividend

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.78 per ADS for the second quarter of 2016, which is
expected to be paid on September 9, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 31,
2016.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.73 per ADS for the first quarter of 2016 on June 3, 2016.

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any
particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the
Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to
grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for

become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile
internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a
positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue
operating World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™, Diablo III®: Reaper of
Souls™, Heroes of the Storm™, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently
due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in
China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for
NetEase’s e-commerce services may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline;

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on investment.
Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess
its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and impairment on
investment, which are non-cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP
financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s
current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose.
NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its
operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on investment have
been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP
net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures
NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies,
and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
