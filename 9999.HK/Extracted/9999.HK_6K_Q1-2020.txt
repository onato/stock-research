                                                      3
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to

revenues from NetEase Cloud Music.

63.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year increases were mainly due to the increase in net revenues while certain costs were relatively fixed.

related to online game services. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increased marketing
expenditures, higher research and development investments as well as higher staff-related costs.

Other Income

Other income consisted of investment income/ (loss), interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and
others. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to the fair value changes of equity investments with
readily determinable fair value, partially offset by unrealized exchange gains. The year-over-year increase was
mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and higher interest income, partially offset by fair value changes of
equity investments with readily determinable fair value.

Share Purchase / Repurchase Program

On November 20, 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share purchase
program of up to US$20.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on November 25, 2019. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao’s ADSs in
open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 134,000
ADSs had been purchased under this program for a total cost of US$2.1 million.

On February 26, 2020, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase
program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on March 2, 2020. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 1.1 million ADSs had been repurchased
under this program for a total cost of US$341.9 million. The Company today announced that its board of
directors has approved an amendment to such program to increase the total authorized repurchase amount to
US$2.0 billion. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in
open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

For both of the above-mentioned current programs, it is expected that the timing and dollar amount of
purchase transactions will be in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18
requirements and such purchases may be affected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.
The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs or purchases Youdao’s ADSs will depend upon a variety
of factors, including market conditions. These programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the
convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience
of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.0808 on March 31, 2020 as set forth
in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB
amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on March 31, 2020, or at any other
certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company has reported the following segments: online game services,
Youdao and innovative businesses and others, aligning with the manner in which the Company’s chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources
and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. The Company retrospectively revised prior period
segment information to conform to current period presentation.




                                                     6
Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)”, which
requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing
incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at
amortized cost. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective
basis and did not restate comparative periods. The impact of new standard was immaterial to the Company.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these
forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by
a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to
grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market within China or globally,
which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its
existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the risk that COVID-19 or other health
risks in China or globally could adversely affect the Company’s operations or financial results (including,
without limitation, the potential for significant short- and long-term global unemployment and economic
weakness and a resulting impact on global discretionary spending; the risk that steps taken by governments to
address COVID-19 in the markets where we operate may impact our workforce and operations and our users
and partners; and the risk that the impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in this
section); the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return
on its marketing expenditures; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the market for online
games, education products and services and e-commerce may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or
cause revenues to decline; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative
online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the
risk that the e-commerce market or the internet advertising market in China will not grow and will remain
subject to intense competition; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods;
competition in NetEase’s existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible
changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of
NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the
value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase’s business and financial
results; and other risks outlined in NetEase’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase
does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the
applicable law.




                                                       8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from
continuing operations per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance
and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding
share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the
Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the
impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the
Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so
choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it
does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-
GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which
should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-
GAAP Results” at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in
its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
