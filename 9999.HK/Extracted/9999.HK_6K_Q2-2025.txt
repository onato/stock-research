Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the second quarter of 2025 were RMB27.9 billion (US$3.9 billion), compared with
RMB28.8 billion and RMB25.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB22.8 billion (US$3.2 billion) for
the second quarter of 2025, compared with RMB24.0 billion and RMB20.1 billion for the preceding
quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Net revenues from the operation of online games
accounted for approximately 97.1% of the segment’s net revenues for the second quarter of 2025,
compared with 97.5% and 96.1% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in online games net revenues was due to certain self-developed and
licensed games. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net revenues from Identity V,
our newly launched games Where Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals and certain licensed games.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1.4 billion (US$197.9 million) for the second quarter of 2025,
compared with RMB1.3 billion each for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024. Net
revenues from its online marketing services and learning services increased quarter-over-quarter and
year-over-year, while net revenues from its smart devices decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year.

Net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music were RMB2.0 billion (US$274.8 million) for the second
quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.9 billion and RMB2.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the
same quarter of 2024, respectively. Net revenues from its online music services increased both quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, while net revenues from its social entertainment services and others
increased quarter-over-quarter but decreased year-over-year.




                                                  3
Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1.7 billion (US$237.2 million) for the
second quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.6 billion and RMB2.1 billion for the preceding quarter
and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase was led by increased net
revenues from Yanxuan. The year-over-year decrease was due to decreased net revenues from
Yanxuan, advertising services and certain other businesses in this segment.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues for the second quarter of 2025 was RMB9.8 billion (US$1.4 billion), compared with
RMB10.3 billion and RMB9.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively, with revenue sharing costs related to platforms and royalties for licensed games
decreasing quarter-over-quarter, while royalties for licensed games increased year-over-year.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2025 was RMB18.1 billion (US$2.5 billion), compared with
RMB18.5 billion and RMB16.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2025 were RMB9.0 billion (US$1.3 billion),
compared with RMB8.0 billion and RMB9.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of
2024, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to increased marketing
expenditures related to games and related value-added services.

Other Income/(Expenses)

Other income/(expenses) consisted of investment income, interest income, net exchange losses/(gains)
and others. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to fair value changes of equity security
investments, and the year-over-year increase was primarily due to net exchange gains in the second
quarter of 2025, compared with net exchange losses recorded in the same quarter of 2024.

Income Tax

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1.6 billion (US$217.9 million) for the second
quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.9 billion and RMB1.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the
same quarter of 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2025 was 14.7%,
compared with 15.3% and 16.0% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively.
The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits
applicable to it in each quarter.

                                                    5
Under the Company’s current dividend policy, the determination to make dividend distributions and
the amount of such distribution in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of its board of
directors and will be based upon the Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition
and other relevant factors.

repurchase program of up to US$5.0 billion of the Company’s ADSs and ordinary shares in open

identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar expressions. In addition, statements
that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its
expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management
in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online games market will not
continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in regulation
environment in the markets where NetEase operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to
continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow

                                                    7
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See the unaudited reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Note 5: Reconciliation between U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, which differ in certain respects from IFRS Accounting Standards. The effects of material
differences between the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information prepared under U.S.
GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards (“Reconciliation Statement”) are as follows in RMB (in
thousands).


                                                                                             13
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditor of the Company in Hong Kong, has performed a limited
assurance engagement on the Reconciliation Statement in accordance with International Standard on
Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) “Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of
Historical Financial Information”.

                                                14
Notes:
Basis of Preparation
The Company is responsible for preparation of the Reconciliation Statement in accordance with the
relevant requirements of the Hong Kong Listing Rules and relevant guidance in HKEX-GL111-22.
The Reconciliation Statement was prepared based on the Company’s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2025 prepared under U.S. GAAP,
with material adjustments made (if any) thereto in arriving at the unaudited financial information of
the Company prepared under IFRS Accounting Standards. The adjustments reflect the material
differences between the Company’s accounting policies under U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting
Standards.
Note a. Investments measured at fair value
Under U.S. GAAP, NetEase applied the measurement alternative to record the investments in equity
securities (including preferred shares and ordinary shares without significant influence) without readily
determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for
observable price changes recognized in the consolidated income statements.
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, these investments were classified as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through profit
or loss.
Note b. Redeemable noncontrolling interests
Under U.S. GAAP, SEC guidance provides for mezzanine-equity (temporary equity) category in
addition to the financial liability and permanent equity categories. The purpose of this “in-between”
category is to indicate that a security whose redemption is outside the control of the issuer may not be
classified as a permanent part of equity. NetEase classified the redeemable preferred shares issued by
certain subsidiaries as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the condensed consolidated balance
sheets and recorded them initially at fair value, net of issuance costs. NetEase recognized accretion to
the respective redemption value of the redeemable preferred shares over the period starting from
issuance date to the earliest redemption date.
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, there is no concept of mezzanine or temporary equity classification.
NetEase designated the redeemable preferred shares as financial liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss which are measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, the amounts of changes in
fair value that were attributed to changes in credit risk of the issuer were recognized in other
comprehensive income, and the remaining amounts of changes in fair value were recognized in the
profit or loss.
