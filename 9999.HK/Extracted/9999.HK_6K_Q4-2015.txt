          NetEase Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing - Feb 24, 2016) - NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) (“NetEase” or the “Company”), one of China's
leading Internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the
fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

“2015 marked a year of tremendous growth fueled by all-around achievement for our company,” said Mr.
William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Our total net revenues grew 94.7% for the
year and 128.2% for the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2014, with expanding
contributions from each of our three business segments. We saw year-over-year net revenue increases in the
fourth quarter of 103.2% from online games, 68.1% from advertising services and 355.5% from e-mail, e-
commerce and others.”

“PC-client games remain vital to China’s online game industry, while mobile games are driving rapid new
growth. The steps we have taken over the last year to enhance our mobile capabilities have secured our
position in the mobile arena. Our high-profile mobile portfolio now consists of over 80 diverse games,
including our Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey Online mobile games, which maintained
their positions as the top two grossing games in China’s iOS app store in the fourth quarter. Our other mobile
games, including licensed game Kai-ri-sei Million Arthur as well as a number of other new and exciting
games such as Invincible, the Kung Fu Panda mobile game and Chrono Blade also demonstrated strong
performances during the fourth quarter.”

“Offering thrilling gaming experiences to our existing and growing community of PC-client players remains
an integral part of our online games strategy. Our self-developed 3D oriental fantasy MMORPG Revelation
maintained strong traction in the fourth quarter, and in November we launched open beta testing for our 3D
warfare MMORPG Hegemon-King of Western Chu. During the fourth quarter we also released new expansion
packs for PC-client games including Tianxia III, Heroes of Tang Dynasty Zero and Kung Fu Master II, and
launched a promotional campaign for Demon Seals. In addition to our successful and growing portfolio of
self-developed online games, Blizzard Entertainment’s Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™ continued to
perform well and attract new players.”

	                                                    1	  
“We are taking a number of steps to broaden our game offerings with exciting new game-play for both our
PC-clients and mobile users. We recently released a trailer for War Rage, a real-time action tactical game for
PC-clients, which we expect to launch in 2016. We also plan to enhance the popularity of our established PC-
client titles with upcoming expansion packs for games including New Westward Journey Online II, Tianxia III,
Heroes of Tang Dynasty Zero, Demon Seals and Kung Fu Master II in the first half of 2016. We are
simultaneously expanding our robust mobile games pipeline with gripping new games. For example, in
January we released new mobile games such as Kung Fu Panda 3 and The X-World, which have quickly
gained traction with players. In addition, a number of other compelling new games including Raven, Fantasy
Westward Journey: Warriors, the mobile version of New Ghost, and a series of new game titles based on the
best-selling novels by Mr. Gu Long, a famous wuxia fiction writer, are scheduled to premiere in the coming
months.”

“Business is thriving across our game and Internet service offerings. In 2015 our advertising services revenues
continued to grow. Supported by the popularity of our Mobile News App and NetEase-hosted, high profile
events such as our NetEase Annual Economist Conference, our overall brand was further strengthened. The
automobile, Internet services and telecommunication services sectors were our top performing advertising
verticals in the fourth quarter. Our e-commerce platforms including Kaola.com also continue to grow at a
swift pace, and we plan to keep expanding this business where we see considerable growth opportunity.”

“We returned over $247.0 million to our investors in 2015 through share repurchases and our regular dividend
program. In 2016 we believe we are well-positioned to continue to create and return value to our shareholders
through diligently building and growing our business with a focus on providing the highest quality PC-client
and mobile games, Internet products and e-commerce services,” Mr. Ding concluded.

respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB5,502.9 million (US$849.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB5,212.9 million and RMB2,707.5 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of

	                                                    2	  
Gross Profit

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2015 was RMB4,219.7 million (US$651.4 million), compared to
RMB3,849.3 million and RMB2,485.4 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from
mobile games such as the Fantasy Westward Journey and the Westward Journey Online mobile games, and
licensed games such as Blizzard Entertainment’s Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft and Diablo® III: Reaper of
Souls™, as well as Kai-ri-sei Million Arthur and NetEase’s new self-developed PC-client games such as
Revelation. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue
contribution from mobile games such as the Westward Journey Online mobile game and Kai-ri-sei Million
Arthur, as well as Blizzard Entertainment’s Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily
attributable to strong demand from the automobile, Internet services and telecommunication sectors, and
NetEase’s monetization efforts for its mobile applications, primarily its Mobile News App.

The year-over-year decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to the temporary
suspension of higher margin e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products since February 2015.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses such as Kaola.com.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 67.2%, compared to
67.9% and 76.0% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margin were mainly due to increased revenue contribution
from mobile games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins as a percentage of NetEase’s total online
games revenues.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 68.1%, compared
to 67.6% and 65.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 6.0%,
compared to 0.1% and 48.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-
over-year decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the temporary suspension of higher
margin e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products discussed above, as well as increased
revenue contribution from NetEase’s other e-commerce platforms, which have relatively lower gross profit
margins. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross profit margin was mainly due to the revenue growth
from NetEase’s e-commerce businesses such as Kaola.com.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were RMB1,801.7 million (US$278.1 million),
compared to RMB1,761.2 million and RMB1,239.7 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and
marketing expenses related to online games and advertising services, higher research and development
investments and higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and marketing
expenses for mobile games.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB513.8 million (US$79.3 million) for the fourth
quarter of 2015, compared to RMB399.2 million and RMB187.9 million for the preceding quarter and the
fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 19.2%, compared
to 17.1% and 12.8% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year
increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were
approved as Key Software Enterprises and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2014. Those
subsidiaries were subject to a tax rate of 15% in 2015.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled RMB2.2 billion
(US$334.1 million), compared to RMB1.9 billion and RMB1.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth
quarter of 2014, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders [1] for the
fourth quarter of 2015 totaled RMB2.4 billion (US$363.5 million), compared to RMB2.1 billion and RMB1.4
billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB66.3 million
(US$10.2 million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB66.5 million and a net foreign exchange
loss of RMB7.1 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-
year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized
exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term
loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.54 and US$2.52, respectively, for the fourth
quarter of 2015. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.21 and US$2.20,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.50 and US$1.49,
respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were	   US$2.77
and US$2.74,	  respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings

expenses. See "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for fiscal year 2015 was RMB13.4 billion (US$2.1 billion), compared to RMB8.5 billion for the
preceding fiscal year.

The increase in online game services gross profit in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased revenue
contribution from the Company’s mobile games such as the Fantasy Westward Journey and the Westward
Journey Online mobile games and Battle to the West, and licensed games such as Blizzard Entertainment’s
Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, as well as NetEase’s self-developed PC-
client games such as Revelation.

The increase in advertising services gross profit in 2015 was due to a rise in demand, mainly from the
automobile, Internet services and real estate sectors, as well as NetEase’s monetization efforts for its mobile
applications, primarily its Mobile News App.

The decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit in 2015 was primarily attributable to temporary
suspension of higher margin e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products since February 2015.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2015 were RMB6.1 billion (US$946.5 million), compared to RMB3.7

million for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate was 15.7% for fiscal year 2015,
compared to 12.1% for fiscal year 2014. The change in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that
certain subsidiaries of the Company were approved as Key Software Enterprises and subject to a preferential
tax rate of 10% for 2014. Those subsidiaries were subject to a tax rate of 15% in 2015.

Net Income After Tax

billion), compared to RMB4.8 billion for the preceding fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the

million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB18.0 million for the preceding fiscal year. The net
foreign exchange changes for fiscal year 2015 and 2014 were mainly due to exchange gains and losses arising
from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate
of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over these periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$7.91 and US$7.86, respectively, for fiscal year
2015, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$5.62 and US$5.60, respectively, for the fiscal year 2014.

quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any
particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the

Other Information

As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time
deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB26.8 billion (US$4.1 billion), compared to RMB23.2
billion as of December 31, 2014. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB8.1 billion (US$1.2
billion) for fiscal year 2015, compared to RMB5.9 billion for the preceding fiscal year.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, NetEase made a reclassification of certain revenue and cost of revenue
items from its advertising services segment to its e-mail, e-commerce and others segment. The reclassification
of these segments reflects changes in the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages
its operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.

Share Repurchase Program

On September 1, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase
program of up to US$500 million of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months.
NetEase plans to fund repurchases made under this program from available working capital. Under the terms
of the approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market
transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions
will be subject to Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected
that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased approximately 0.19 million ADSs for approximately
US$20.7 million under this program.

	                                                      8

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
