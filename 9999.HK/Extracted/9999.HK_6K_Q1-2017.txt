innovative content to our massive audience,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of
NetEase. “During the period, we advanced our strategic initiatives by rolling out new mobile games and
expansion packs for our PC-client games, enhancing the monetization capabilities of our advertising services,
and expanding our growing e-commerce businesses. The Company continues to introduce popular games that
enrich the online game market in China, and initiated closed beta testing for Minecraft in April. We are also
actively expanding our international footprint by bringing hit titles such as Onmyoji and Land of Glory to
global audiences.”

“Ingenuity remains the cornerstone of our success across each of our core business lines where there are ample
opportunities for growth. We are devoting significant resources to our media business supported by our deep
expertise and R&D capabilities. Our e-commerce businesses such as Kaola.com and Yanxuan are also thriving
with promising growth trajectories. With these initiatives and our focus on creating premium content, we aim
not only to expand our business, but to grow our community and elevate users’ imaginations,” Mr. Ding
concluded.

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were RMB13,640.5 million (US$1,981.7 million), compared to
RMB12,099.0 million and RMB7,915.4 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB10,735.5 million (US$1,559.7 million) for the first quarter of 2017,
compared to RMB8,959.1 million and RMB6,015.1 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2016, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 73.3% of net revenues from online games in
the first quarter of 2017, compared to 64.4% and 63.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016,
respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB445.2 million (US$64.7 million) for the first quarter of 2017,
compared to RMB664.8 million and RMB393.2 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016,
respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the first quarter of 2017 were automobile, real estate
and telecommunication services.

Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB2,459.9 million (US$357.4 million) for the first
quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2,475.1 million and RMB1,507.1 million for the preceding quarter and the
first quarter of 2016, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was RMB7,483.6 million (US$1,087.2 million), compared to
RMB6,463.3 million and RMB4,586.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from
mobile games such as Onmyoji, the mobile version of New Ghost and Demon Seals mobile as well as Blizzard
Entertainment’s Overwatch® and World of Warcraft®. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online games gross
profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from mobile games such as Onmyoji, the mobile version
of New Ghost and Demon Seals mobile.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.

The year-over-year increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to increased
revenue contribution from NetEase’s e-commerce businesses such as Kaola.com. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution
from certain e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins.




                                                       3
Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the first quarter of 2017 was 63.9%, compared to 60.7%
and 67.1% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in
gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games, which have
relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online games net revenues. The
quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to decreased revenue contribution from
licensed games in the current quarter, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, and the one-off
recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter of 2016, and partially
offset by the increased revenue contribution from mobile games in the current quarter.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the first quarter of 2017 was 57.3%, compared to
66.5% and 62.4% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher staff-related and content purchase costs. The quarter-
over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others businesses for the first quarter of 2017 was 14.8%,
compared to 23.4% and 20.4% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-
over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margin were primarily attributable to decreased
revenue contribution from certain e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were RMB2,711.7 million (US$394.0 million),
compared to RMB2,596.6 million and RMB1,718.9 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and
marketing expenses related to online games, higher research and development investments, higher staff-related
costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation and operating expenses related to
Kaola.com. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher staff-related
costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB943.0 million (US$137.0 million) for the first quarter
of 2017, compared to RMB882.0 million and RMB530.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter
of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 19.0%, compared to 19.2% and
17.5% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The change in effective tax rate
represents the Company’s estimate of the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017.




                                                      4
Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the first quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.9 billion
(US$569.9 million), compared to RMB3.7 billion and RMB2.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the first
quarter of 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the first
quarter of 2017 totaled RMB4.3 billion (US$630.0 million), compared to RMB4.0 billion and RMB2.7 billion
for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively.

During the first quarter of 2017, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB48.5 million (US$7.0
million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB90.5 million and a net foreign exchange loss of
RMB36.0 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange
gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan
balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.33 and US$4.29, respectively, for the first
quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.08 and US$4.04,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.72 and US$2.70,
respectively, for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$4.79 and
US$4.75, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per
ADS of US$4.38 and US$4.34, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted
earnings per ADS of US$2.94 and US$2.92, respectively, for the first quarter of 2016.

Quarterly Dividend

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$1.08 per ADS for the first quarter of 2017, which is
expected to be paid on June 2, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2017.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$1.01 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2016 on March 10, 2017.

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any
particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the
Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Other Information

As of March 31, 2017, the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits
and short-term investments balance totaled RMB40.6 billion (US$5.9 billion), compared to RMB36.9 billion
as of December 31, 2016. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB4.0 billion (US$585.7
million) for the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB5.4 billion and RMB3.1 billion for the preceding
quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively.



                                                     5

forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by
a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to

example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not
become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile
internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a
positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue
operating World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls™, Heroes of the
Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible
governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline;
competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and
services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased
advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online
services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce
businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the
non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability
may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.

*In 2017, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2015-17 issued by FASB in November 2015, which requires entities to present
deferred tax assets ("DTA") and deferred tax liabilities ("DTL") as non-current in the balance sheets. Pursuant to the guidance, the
Company retrospectively reclassified current DTA and current DTL to non-current assets and to non-current liabilities, respectively, in
the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
