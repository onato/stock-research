                   NetEase Reports Second Quarter 2015 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing – August 12, 2015) – NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES), one of China’s leading Internet and online
game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30,
2015.

“The strong second quarter 2015 results reflect our recent successes on both PC and mobile platforms,” said
Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. “Each of our three business segments
achieved healthy revenue gains sequentially and year-over-year, led by a 64.8% increase in online games
revenues, a 22.8% increase in advertising services revenues, and a 123.3% increase in e-mail, e-commerce and
others revenues, compared with the same quarter in 2014.”

“Mobile games are driving additional growth both for our company and China’s online games industry as a
whole. With more than 30 high quality mobile games in our portfolio, we have offerings that appeal to a wide
audience, and we intend to continue to build on this success. Our Fantasy Westward Journey mobile game
reached a record peak concurrent user level of more than 2.0 million in May and has been ranked as the top
grossing app in the iOS China app store since its launch in March of this year. It also became the only mobile
game in China with its own customized download page in the iOS app store in July. For our PC-client games,
we were very pleased with the favorable feedback for Revelation, our 3D oriental fantasy MMORPG, and our
2.5D MMORPG Demon Seals, which was launched in the second quarter. Other new releases in the second
quarter included expansion packs for New Westward Journey Online II and Ghost II. During the second
quarter, we also conducted further beta testing for our 3D warfare MMORPG, Hegemon-King of Western
Chu.”

“Our licensed games also fared well in the second quarter. We were very excited to launch open beta testing
for Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls™ in China in April, through the joint effort of
Blizzard and NetEase and with the incredible support of passionate Chinese players. Additionally, the April
launch of the mobile phone version of Blizzard Entertainment’s Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™ helped
drive that game’s number of active users to a new high. Lastly, Heroes of the Storm™, Blizzard's brand-new
free-to-play online team brawler, began open beta testing in late May followed by the game’s official launch

	                                                    1	  
in early June, which had a promising performance. We continue to work closely with Blizzard to introduce
exciting new content to China and are thrilled to have licensed Overwatch™, Blizzard’s first-ever first-person
shooter game.”

“Our strong research and development program has produced a diverse pipeline of PC-client and mobile
games. In July, we released a new expansion pack for our popular title Tianxia III and are targeting a number
of new expansion packs later in the third quarter for our self-developed games, including Fantasy Westward
Journey II. Our mobile portfolio is also expanding with the release of several new titles in July, including
Fairy Tales: The World of the Brave, a licensed cartoon-style side-scrolling mobile game, which was well
received by our users. In the coming months, we plan to release more mobile games based on our acclaimed
self-developed franchises, including the Westward Journey Online mobile game, The X-World, an action-
packed mobile ARPG game from the Tianxia universe, and Fantasy Westward Journey: Warriors, an exciting
mobile action adventure game.”

“In addition, our strategy to expand our reach to international markets is underway, and we are making early
stage progress. We plan to use a number of channels to reach a broad market, including independent sales,
cross-country partnerships and licensing. We expect to launch Speedy Ninja, our first mobile game title in
North America, in late August, and have already licensed several of our mobile games in the Southeast Asia
market.”

“Our advertising services business continued to perform well in the second quarter, driven by overall market
demand and monetization efforts for our Mobile News App. The top performing advertising verticals in the
second quarter were the automobile, Internet services, and food and beverage sectors. Furthermore, our cross-
border e-commerce platform, Kaola.com, experienced rapid growth in the second quarter and continues to
gain user traction.”

“Our ability to grow with the mobile market and adapt our technology and creative resources to meet that
demand supports our strategy to expand and diversify our portfolio. We will continue to focus on creating
innovative new games, enhancing the synergy between PC-client and mobile games and expanding our loyal
user base. Our goal is to achieve balanced growth in all of our businesses by delivering the highest quality
products and services,” Mr. Ding concluded.

Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results

Revenues

Total revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB4,833.1 million (US$779.5 million), compared to
RMB3,885.2 million and RMB2,951.9 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014,
respectively.

Revenues from online games were RMB3,849.9 million (US$621.0 million) for the second quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB3,104.2 million and RMB2,336.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2014, respectively.



	                                                     2	  
Revenues from advertising services were RMB477.7 million (US$77.0 million) for the second quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB332.6 million and RMB389.1 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2014, respectively.

Revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB505.5 million (US$81.5 million) for the second
quarter of 2015, compared to RMB448.4 million and RMB226.3 million for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2014, respectively.

Sales Taxes

Total sales taxes for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB265.2 million (US$42.8 million), compared to
RMB225.0 million and RMB184.4 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014,
respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in sales taxes were mainly due to the
increases in NetEase’s total revenues.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB2,845.6 million (US$459.0 million), compared to
RMB2,489.1 million and RMB1,999.7 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014,
respectively.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in online games gross profit were primarily driven by
revenue contribution from mobile games such as the Fantasy Westward Journey mobile game, and licensed
games such as Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo III®, Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™ and Heroes of the
Storm™, as well as NetEase’s new self-developed PC-client games such as Revelation and Demon Seals.

The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily attributable to strong demand
from the automobile, Internet services and food and beverage sectors, and NetEase’s monetization efforts for
its mobile applications, primarily its Mobile News App. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising
services revenues and gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit were
primarily due to the temporary suspension of e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products since
late February 2015, which was partially offset by increased revenue contribution from NetEase’s cross-border
e-commerce platform Kaola.com and e-mail services, which have relatively lower gross profit margins.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the second quarter of 2015 was 69.3%, compared to
73.1% and 77.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margin were mainly due to increased revenue contribution
from mobile games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total
online games revenues.



	                                                    3	  
Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the second quarter of 2015 was 68.2%, compared
to 59.2% and 60.9% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to enhanced economies of scale
driven by revenue growth.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the second quarter of 2015 was 4.2%,
compared to 38.9% and 35.7% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014, respectively. The
year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margin were primarily attributable to the
temporary suspension of e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products discussed above, as well
as increased revenue contribution from Kaola.com and e-mail services, which have relatively lower gross
profit margins.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB1,395.2 million (US$225.0 million),
compared to RMB1,173.5 million and RMB823.7 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and
marketing expenses for mobile and PC-client games, and increased staff-related research and development
costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and share-based compensation. The quarter-over-
quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased promotional costs for online games, which
was partially offset by decreased promotional costs for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB145.9 million (US$23.5 million) for the second
quarter of 2015, compared to RMB214.5 million and RMB97.9 million for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 9.2%,
compared to 14.1% and 7.4% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014, respectively. The
quarter-over-quarter decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that the Company recognized
certain tax credits in the second quarter of 2015 related to annual tax filing benefits, most of which comprised
extra tax deductions for research and development expenses approved by the tax authorities.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the second quarter of 2015 totaled RMB1.4 billion
(US$229.7 million), compared to RMB1.3 billion and RMB1.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2014, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders[1] for
the second quarter of 2015 totaled RMB1.6 billion (US$256.4 million), compared to RMB1.4 billion and
RMB1.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB21.7 million
(US$3.5 million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB22.7 million and a net foreign exchange
loss of RMB20.2 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014, respectively. The quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year changes in foreign exchange gains/(losses) were mainly due to unrealized


	                                                     4	  
exchange gains/(losses) arising from the Company’s foreign currency-denominated bank deposits and short-
term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.75 and US$1.74, respectively, for the second
quarter of 2015. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.56 and US$1.55,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.48 each for the
second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were	   US$1.95 and US$1.94,	  
respectively, for the second quarter of 2015, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of
US$1.75 and US$1.74, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and US$1.57 each for the second quarter of
2014.


[1]    As used in this press release, non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is defined to exclude share-based compensation
       expenses. See "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release.


Quarterly Dividend

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.39 per ADS for the first quarter of 2015 on June 5, 2015.

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.44 per ADS for the second quarter of 2015, which is
expected to be paid on September 4, 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 28,
2015. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular
quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company’s
operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Other Information

As of June 30, 2015, the Company’s total cash and current and non-current time deposits balance was
RMB20.7 billion (US$3.3 billion), compared to RMB21.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. Cash flow
generated from operating activities was RMB835.9 million (US$134.8 million) for the second quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB1.9 billion and RMB1.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2014,
respectively.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, NetEase made a reclassification of certain revenue and cost of revenue
items from its advertising services segment to its e-mail, e-commerce and others segment. The segments
reclassification reflects changes in the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its
operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

operating World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®:Heroes of Warcraft™, Diablo III®: Reaper of
Souls™, Heroes of the Storm™ , Overwatch™ or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently
due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in
China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures we use may differ from the non-
GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may
be limited.


	                                                     7	  
NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
