with 64.6% and 63.8% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2020, respectively. Gross

45.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2020, respectively. The year-over-year

million), compared with RMB6,777.1 million and RMB5,622.3 million for the preceding quarter and

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment income, interest income, exchange gains/ (losses)
and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to unrealized

second quarter of 2021, compared with RMB1,273.4 million and RMB1,064.5 million for the

Update on PRC Regulatory Policy Related to Youdao

As previously announced by Youdao, its business, financial condition and corporate structure are
expected to be materially affected in future periods by the changing regulatory environment
primarily in China’s K-12 education industry, although the magnitude of the impact remains
uncertain at this time.

Share Repurchase/ Purchase Program

On February 25, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share
repurchase program of up to US$2.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs and ordinary shares
in open market transactions for a period not to exceed 24 months beginning on March 2, 2021. As of
June 30, 2021, approximately 4.6 million ADSs had been repurchased under this program for a total
cost of US$0.5 billion. The Company today announced that its board of directors has approved an
amendment to such program to increase the total authorized repurchase amount to US$3.0 billion.

The Company today also announced that its board of directors has approved a share purchase
program of up to US$50.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 36
months beginning on September 2, 2021. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase
Youdao’s ADSs in open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange.

The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs and its ordinary shares or purchases Youdao’s
ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions. These programs may be
suspended or discontinued at any time.

                                                    7
the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its
position in that market in China or globally; potential changes in government regulations, or changes
in the interpretation and implementation of government regulations, that could adversely affect the
industries and geographical markets in which NetEase and its subsidiaries operate, including, among
others, recently announced government initiatives to enhance supervision of overseas-listed, China-
based companies and increase scrutiny of data security and cross-border data flow, as well as recent
guidelines restricting certain activities in China’s education market; the risk that COVID-19 or other
health risks in China or globally could adversely affect the Company’s operations or financial
results; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; the risk that NetEase may not be able
to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or

and other risks is included in NetEase’s filings with the SEC and announcements on the website of
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-
looking information, except as required under the applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS
and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and
formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the
same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-
GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools.
One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s

                                                   8
shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-
GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their
comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its
financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
