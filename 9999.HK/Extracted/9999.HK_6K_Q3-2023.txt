Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were RMB27,270.4 million (US$3,737.7 million), compared
with RMB24,011.3 million and RMB24,426.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB21,779.9 million (US$2,985.2
million) for the third quarter of 2023, compared with RMB18,798.6 million and RMB18,699.1 million
for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively. Net revenues from the operation
of online games accounted for approximately 93.7% of the segment’s net revenues for the third quarter
of 2023, compared with 91.7% and 92.9% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022,
respectively. Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 77.6% of net revenues
from the operation of online games for the third quarter of 2023, compared with 73.6% and 68.6% for
the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1,538.8 million (US$210.9 million) for the third quarter of 2023,
compared with RMB1,206.6 million and RMB1,402.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from Cloud Music were RMB1,973.1 million (US$270.4 million) for the third quarter of
2023, compared with RMB1,948.5 million and RMB2,357.2 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1,978.7 million (US$271.2 million) for
the third quarter of 2023, compared with RMB2,057.5 million and RMB1,968.0 million for the
preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2023 was RMB16,966.3 million (US$2,325.4 million), compared
with RMB14,375.4 million and RMB13,743.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2022, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in games and related value-added services’ gross profit was primarily
due to increased net revenues from newly launched games such as Justice mobile game and Racing
Master. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from the operation of
online games such as Eggy Party and those newly launched titles, as well as decreased royalty fees due
to the termination of certain licensed games.

                                                  3
The quarter-over-quarter increase in Youdao’s gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in
net revenues from its learning services. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from increased
revenue contribution from both its learning services and online marketing services.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music’s gross profit primarily resulted
from increased net revenues from sales of membership subscriptions and continued improvement in
cost control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in innovative businesses and others’ gross profit was primarily due
to decreased e-commerce gross profit from Yanxuan. The year-over-year increase was primarily due
to increased gross profit from Yanxuan and several other businesses included within the segment.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the third quarter of 2023 was 69.0%,
compared with 67.4% and 65.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to changes in the revenue mix of
NetEase’s self-developed, co-developed and licensed games, as well as the relative revenue
contribution from different channels. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to a higher
proportion of net revenues contributed by NetEase’s self-developed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2023 was 55.9%, compared with 47.0% and
54.2% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year increases were primarily attributable to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music for the third quarter of 2023 was 27.2%, compared with 27.0%
and 14.2% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2023 was 27.3%,
compared with 29.5% and 25.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year fluctuations were mainly due to changes in the product
mix within the segment.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were RMB9,408.4 million (US$1,289.5 million),
compared with RMB8,312.8 million and RMB9,002.1 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased marketing
expenditures and staff-related costs associated with games and related value-added services. The year-
over-year increase was mainly due to higher research and development investments.




                                                   4
Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment income, interest income, exchange gains/ (losses)
and others. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to net unrealized
exchange losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and loan balances
as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated in the third quarter of 2023.

Income Tax

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,290.4 million (US$176.9 million) for the
third quarter of 2023, compared with RMB712.1 million and RMB1,586.7 million for the preceding
quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023
was 14.2%, compared with 8.0% and 19.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022,
respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the preceding quarter was primarily due to tax benefits
recognized in that quarter. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the
tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB7,836.9 million (US$1,074.1
million) for the third quarter of 2023, compared with RMB8,242.8 million and RMB6,699.4 million
for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.

NetEase reported basic net income of US$0.33 per share (US$1.67 per ADS) for the third quarter of
2023, compared with US$0.35 per share (US$1.75 per ADS) and US$0.28 per share (US$1.41 per
ADS) for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.

Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled
RMB8,645.2 million (US$1,184.9 million) for the third quarter of 2023, compared with RMB9,017.5
million and RMB7,469.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2022, respectively.

NetEase reported non-GAAP basic net income from continuing operations of US$0.37 per share
(US$1.84 per ADS) for the third quarter of 2023, compared with US$0.38 per share (US$1.92 per
ADS) and US$0.31 per share (US$1.57 per ADS) for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2022, respectively.

in September 2023.

Under the Company’s current dividend policy, the determination to make dividend distributions and
the amount of such distribution in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of its board of
directors and will be based upon the Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition
and other relevant factors.

Share Repurchase Program

On November 17, 2022, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share
repurchase program of up to US$5.0 billion of the Company’s ADSs and ordinary shares in open
market transactions. This share repurchase program commenced on January 10, 2023 following the
completion of the prior program on January 9, 2023, and will be in effect for a period not to exceed 36
months from such date. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 6.6 million ADSs had been
repurchased under this program for a total cost of US$587.9 million.

The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs and its ordinary shares depends upon a variety of
factors, including market conditions. These programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from

among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in government
regulation that could adversely affect the industry and geographical markets in which NetEase

                                                    8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted
net income from continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing
and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders
excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating
results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial
measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable
to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore
their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure,
all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited
Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase
encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial
measure.
