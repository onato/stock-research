                                                      3
The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net
revenues from self-developed mobile games such as Invincible, Life-After and Knives Out. The year-over-year
increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from self-developed mobile games Fantasy Westward
Journey 3D, Invincible and Fantasy Westward Journey mobile game, as well as certain licensed games.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Youdao gross profit were primarily attributable to the
significant increase in net revenues, improved economies of scale and faculty compensation structure
optimization for its learning services and products.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to the
improvement in gross profit from advertising services, Yanxuan and NetEase Cloud Music. The year-over-
year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for online game services for the second quarter of 2020 was 63.8%, compared to 64.1%
and 63.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2019, respectively. Gross profit margin for
online game services was generally stable, fluctuating within a narrow band based on the revenue mix of
mobile and PC games, as well as self-developed and licensed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the second quarter of 2020 was 45.2%, compared to 43.5% and 32.9% for
the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter margin was
comparatively stable. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the second quarter of 2020 was 18.5%, compared
to 15.8% and 15.5% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter increase was primarily due to improvement in gross profit margin from advertising services, Yanxuan
and NetEase Cloud Music. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from
NetEase Cloud Music.

compared to RMB4,891.2 million and RMB4,012.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to increased
marketing expenditures related to online game services and Youdao, as well as higher staff-related costs and
research and development investments.

Other Income

Other income consisted of investment income/ (loss), interest income, exchange gains and others. The quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to the gains from fair value changes of equity
investments with readily determinable fair value and government incentives recognized.

particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the
Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Share Purchase / Repurchase Program

On November 20, 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share purchase
program of up to US$20.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on November 25, 2019. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao’s ADSs in
open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 198,000
ADSs had been purchased under this program for a total cost of US$3.4 million.

On February 26, 2020, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase
program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on March 2, 2020. On May 19, 2020, the Company announced that its board of directors had
approved an amendment to such program to increase the total authorized repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion.
Under the terms of this program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market

had been repurchased under this program for a total cost of US$755.7 million.

requirements and such purchases may be affected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.
The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs or purchases Youdao’s ADSs will depend upon a variety
of factors, including market conditions. These programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

                                                      6
Change in Segment Reporting

Effective in the third quarter of 2019, the Company has reported the following segments: online game services,
Youdao and innovative businesses and others, aligning with the manner in which the Company’s chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources
and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. The Company retrospectively revised prior period
segment information to conform to current period presentation.

Initial Public Offering in Hong Kong

In June, the Company successfully listed its ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange with a global offering of 197,202,000 ordinary shares. Gross proceeds from the global offering,
before any underwriting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately HK$24,255.8 million.

Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)”, which
requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing
incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at
amortized cost. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective
basis and did not restate comparative periods. The impact of new standard was immaterial to the Company.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from
continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating
performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding
share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the
Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the
impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the
Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so
choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it
does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of
non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which
should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
