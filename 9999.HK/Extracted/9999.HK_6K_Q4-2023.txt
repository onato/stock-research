Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB27.1 billion (US$3.8 billion), compared with
RMB27.3 billion and RMB25.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022,
respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB20.9 billion (US$2.9 billion) for
the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with RMB21.8 billion and RMB19.1 billion for the preceding
quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. Net revenues from the operation of online games
accounted for approximately 93.4% of the segment’s net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023,
compared with 93.7% and 91.8% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.
Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 76.7% of net revenues from the
operation of online games for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with 77.6% and 66.4% for the
preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1.5 billion (US$208.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023,
compared with RMB1.5 billion each for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022.

Net revenues from Cloud Music were RMB2.0 billion (US$279.7 million) for the fourth quarter of
2023, compared with RMB2.0 billion and RMB2.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth
quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB2.8 billion (US$387.7 million) for the
fourth quarter of 2023, compared with RMB2.0 billion and RMB2.4 billion for the preceding quarter
and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was RMB16.8 billion (US$2.4 billion), compared with
RMB17.0 billion and RMB13.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022,
respectively.

The slight quarter-over-quarter decrease in games and related value-added services’ gross profit was
primarily due to decreased net revenues from online games. The year-over-year increase was primarily


                                                 3
due to increased net revenues from online games such as Justice mobile game, which was launched in
2023, and Eggy Party, offset in part by the termination of certain licensed games.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao’s gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue
contribution from its learning services. The slight year-over-year decrease was primarily due to reduced
revenue contribution from its smart devices, which was partially offset by increased revenue
contribution from its online marketing services.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music’s gross profit primarily resulted
from increased net revenues from sales of membership subscriptions and continued improvement in
cost control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in innovative businesses and others’ gross profit
were primarily due to increased gross profit contribution from Yanxuan and advertising services.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the fourth quarter of 2023 was
69.5%, compared with 69.0% and 59.1% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022,
respectively. The slight quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to changes in the
revenue contribution from different channels. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to
a higher proportion of net revenues contributed by NetEase’s self-developed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 49.9%, compared with 55.9% and
53.3% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to decreased revenue contribution from its learning
services and decreased gross profit margin from its smart devices.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 30.3%, compared with 27.2%
and 17.8% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 34.4%,
compared with 27.3% and 31.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to improved gross profit margin from advertising
services. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to improved gross profit margin from Yanxuan
and advertising services.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB10.0 billion (US$1.4 billion),
compared with RMB9.4 billion and RMB8.8 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter
of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to
increased marketing expenditures and research and development investments associated with games
and related value-added services.

                                                   4
Other Income/(Expenses)

Other income/(expenses) consisted of investment (loss)/income, interest income, exchange (losses)/
gains and others. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to a net investment loss resulting
from fair value changes of equity investments with readily determinable fair value in the fourth quarter
of 2023, compared with a net investment income recorded in the prior quarter, as well as a higher net
exchange loss arising from the fluctuation of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB in
the fourth quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to higher interest
income resulting from the improved net cash position.

Income Tax

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1.1 billion (US$150.5 million) for the fourth
quarter of 2023, compared with RMB1.3 billion and RMB966.6 million for the preceding quarter and
the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 13.8%,
compared with 14.2% and 20.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.
The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits
applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB6.6 billion (US$927.1 million)
for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with RMB7.8 billion and RMB4.0 billion for the preceding
quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.

NetEase reported basic net income of US$0.29 per share (US$1.44 per ADS) for the fourth quarter of
2023, compared with US$0.34 per share (US$1.72 per ADS) and US$0.17 per share (US$0.86 per
ADS) for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.

Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled
RMB7.4 billion (US$1.0 billion) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with RMB8.6 billion and
RMB4.8 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.

NetEase reported non-GAAP basic net income from continuing operations of US$0.32 per share
(US$1.62 per ADS) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with US$0.38 per share (US$1.89 per
ADS) and US$0.21 per share (US$1.05 per ADS) for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2022, respectively.

                                                    5
Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB81.6 billion (US$11.5 billion)
for fiscal year 2023, compared with RMB74.6 billion for fiscal year 2022. Net revenues from the
operation of online games accounted for approximately 92.9% of the segment’s total net revenues for
fiscal year 2023, compared with 92.5% for fiscal year 2022. Net revenues from mobile games
accounted for approximately 75.2% of net revenues from the operation of online games for fiscal year
2023, compared with 67.0% for fiscal year 2022. The higher percentage contribution from mobile
games was mainly due to a higher proportion of net revenues generated by mobile games such as Eggy
Party and Justice mobile game.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB5.4 billion (US$759.1 million) for fiscal year 2023, compared
with RMB5.0 billion for fiscal year 2022.

Net revenues from Cloud Music were RMB7.9 billion (US$1.1 billion) for fiscal year 2023, compared
with RMB9.0 billion for fiscal year 2022.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB8.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) for fiscal
year 2023, compared with RMB7.9 billion for fiscal year 2022.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for fiscal year 2023 was RMB63.1 billion (US$8.9 billion), compared with RMB52.8
billion for fiscal year 2022.

The year-over-year increase in games and related value-added services gross profit was primarily due
to increased net revenues from the operation of online games, mainly from certain newly launched
mobile games.

The year-over-year increase in Youdao gross profit was mainly due to increased revenue contribution
from its online marketing services and learning services.

The year-over-year increase in Cloud Music gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net
revenues from sales of membership subscriptions and continued improvement in cost control measures.

The year-over-year increase in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to
increased gross profits from Yanxuan and several other businesses included within the segment.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2023 were RMB35.4 billion (US$5.0 billion), compared with
RMB33.1 billion for fiscal year 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher research
and development investments and marketing expenditures for games and related value-added services.




                                                  6
Other Income/(Expenses)

The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher interest income resulting from the Company’s
increased net cash position, and investment income arising from fair value changes of equity
investments with readily determinable fair value. The foregoing was partially offset by the fact that the
Company recorded a net exchange loss in fiscal year 2023, compared to a net exchange gain in fiscal
year 2022, mainly resulting from the fluctuation of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the
RMB during the years.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB4.7 billion (US$661.9 million) for fiscal year
2023, compared with RMB5.0 billion for fiscal year 2022. The effective tax rate was 13.8% for fiscal
year 2023, compared with 20.7% for fiscal year 2022. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023
was partially due to tax benefits recognized in the year.

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for fiscal year 2023 totaled RMB29.4 billion
(US$4.1 billion), compared with RMB20.3 billion for fiscal year 2022.

that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its

looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online games market will not
continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement

among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in government
regulation that could adversely affect the industry and geographical markets in which NetEase

related to economic uncertainty and capital market disruption; risks related to the expansion of

                                                    9
NetEase’s businesses and operations internationally; risks associated with cybersecurity threats or

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted
net income from continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing
and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders
excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating
results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that
this non-GAAP financial measure provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial
measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable
to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore
their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure,
all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See the unaudited
reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages
you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
