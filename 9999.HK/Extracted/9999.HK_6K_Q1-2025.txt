First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the first quarter of 2025 were RMB28.8 billion (US$4.0 billion), compared with
RMB26.7 billion and RMB26.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB24.0 billion (US$3.3 billion) for
the first quarter of 2025, compared with RMB21.2 billion and RMB21.5 billion for the preceding
quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Net revenues from the operation of online games
accounted for approximately 97.5% of the segment’s net revenues for the first quarter of 2025,
compared with 96.7% and 95.2% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to increased online games net revenues, such as
Identity V and certain newly launched titles including Where Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals. The year-
over-year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Identity V, several newly launched
titles, as well as certain licensed games.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1.3 billion (US$178.9 million) for the first quarter of 2025,
compared with RMB1.3 billion and RMB1.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of
2024, respectively. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from
its learning services as it continued to prioritize core services with strong long-term potential.

Net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music were RMB1.9 billion (US$256.1 million) for the first quarter
of 2025, compared with RMB1.9 billion and RMB2.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the same
quarter of 2024, respectively. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to decreased net revenues
from its social entertainment services.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1.6 billion (US$223.8 million) for the
first quarter of 2025, compared with RMB2.3 billion and RMB2.0 billion for the preceding quarter
and the same quarter of 2024, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases
were primarily due to decreased net revenues from Yanxuan, advertising services and certain other
businesses in this segment.




                                                  3
Gross Profit

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2025 was RMB18.5 billion (US$2.5 billion), compared with
RMB16.3 billion and RMB17.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were primarily due to increased
net revenues from online games as mentioned above.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2025 were RMB8.0 billion (US$1.1 billion), compared
with RMB8.5 billion and RMB9.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024,
respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased research and
development investments related to games and related value-added services and marketing
expenditures related to innovative businesses and others. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due
to decreased marketing expenditures related to games and related value-added services.

Other Income/(Expenses)

Other income/(expenses) consisted of investment income/(loss), interest income, net exchange gains
and others. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased net exchange gains. The
year-over-year increase was mainly due to lower investment impairment provisions incurred in the
first quarter of 2025.

Income Tax

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1.9 billion (US$262.5 million) for the first
quarter of 2025, compared with RMB1.4 billion and RMB1.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the
same quarter of 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was 15.3%,
compared with 13.4% and 16.0% for the preceding quarter and the same quarter of 2024, respectively.
The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits
applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB10.3 billion (US$1.4 billion) for
the first quarter of 2025, compared with RMB8.8 billion and RMB7.6 billion for the preceding quarter

current time deposits and restricted cash, as well as short-term investments balance, minus short-term
and long-term loans) totaled RMB137.0 billion (US$18.9 billion), compared with RMB131.5 billion

billion) for the first quarter of 2025, compared with RMB13.0 billion and RMB9.6 billion for the

This announcement contains statements of a forward-looking nature. These statements are made under
the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can
identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar expressions. In addition, statements
that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its
expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management
in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from

globally; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating strategies and its ability to implement
such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations and business; competition for,
among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes in regulation
environment in the markets where NetEase operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to

                                                    7
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share,
as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its
business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-
GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to
assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses.
NetEase believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in
understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same
manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP
financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does
not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the
presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be
considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See the unaudited reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
