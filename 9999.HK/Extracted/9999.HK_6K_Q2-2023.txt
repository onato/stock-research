second quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services were RMB18,798.6 million (US$2,592.5
million) for the second quarter of 2023, compared with RMB20,065.6 million and RMB18,139.8
million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively. Net revenues from the

quarter of 2022, respectively. Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 73.6% of

and 66.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB1,206.6 million (US$166.4 million) for the second quarter of

                                                 3
Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2023 was RMB14,375.4 million (US$1,982.5 million), compared
with RMB14,896.5 million and RMB12,941.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter
of 2022, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in games and related value-added services’ gross profit was
primarily due to decreased net revenues from the operation of online games as a result of seasonality.
The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from the operation of online
games such as Eggy Party, as well as decreased royalty fees due to the termination of certain licensed
games.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao’s gross profit primarily resulted from decreased revenue
contribution from its learning services. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from increased
revenue contribution from its online marketing services and learning services.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music’s gross profit primarily resulted
from increased net revenues from sales of membership subscriptions and continued improvement in
cost control measures.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in innovative businesses and others’ gross profit
were primarily due to increased e-commerce net revenues from Yanxuan.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the second quarter of 2023 was
67.4%, compared with 66.7% and 64.9% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022,
respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were primarily attributable to
changes in the revenue mix of NetEase’s self-developed, co-developed and licensed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the second quarter of 2023 was 47.0%, compared with 51.7% and
42.8% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease was mainly due to the reduction in revenue contribution from its learning services which have
a higher gross profit margin compared to its other products and services. The year-over-year increase
was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from its online marketing services and learning
services.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music for the second quarter of 2023 was 27.0%, compared with 22.4%
and 13.0% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the second quarter of 2023 was 29.5%,
compared with 25.4% and 25.8% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to margin improvement from
Yanxuan.

                                                  4
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 were RMB8,312.8 million (US$1,146.4
million), compared with RMB7,676.5 million and RMB7,995.2 million for the preceding quarter and
the second quarter of 2022, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased
marketing and research and development expenditures related to games and related value-added
services. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher staff-related costs.

Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment (loss)/ income, interest income, exchange gains/
(losses) and others. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to net unrealized exchange gains
arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and loans balances as the exchange
rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated in the second quarter of 2023. The year-over-year
increase was mainly due to higher investment income from fair value changes of equity investments
with readily determinable fair value, as well as higher net unrealized exchange gains.

Income Tax

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB712.1 million (US$98.2 million) for the
second quarter of 2023, compared with RMB1,628.6 million and RMB1,259.3 million for the
preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second
quarter of 2023 was 8.0%, compared with 19.5% and 22.0% for the preceding quarter and the second
quarter of 2022, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was primarily
due to tax benefits recognized in the quarter. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the
Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled RMB8,242.8 million (US$1,136.7
million) for the second quarter of 2023, compared with RMB6,754.6 million and RMB5,291.5 million
for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively.

NetEase reported basic net income of US$0.35 per share (US$1.77 per ADS) for the second quarter of
2023, compared with US$0.29 per share (US$1.45 per ADS) and US$0.22 per share (US$1.11 per
ADS) for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2022, respectively.




                                                   5

RMB9,017.5 million (US$1,243.6 million) for the second quarter of 2023, compared with

2022, respectively.

NetEase reported non-GAAP basic net income from continuing operations of US$0.39 per share
(US$1.93 per ADS) for the second quarter of 2023, compared with US$0.32 per share (US$1.62 per
ADS) and US$0.23 per share (US$1.14 per ADS) for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2022, respectively.

deposits and restricted cash, as well as short-term investments balance, minus short-term and long-term
loans, totaled RMB99.6 billion (US$13.7 billion), compared with RMB95.6 billion as of December 31,
2022. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB7.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) for the
second quarter of 2023, compared with RMB6.0 billion and RMB6.6 billion for the preceding quarter
and the second quarter of 2022, respectively.

June 2023.

                                                    8
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted
net income from continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing
and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders
excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating
results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial
measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable
to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore
their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure,
all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited
Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase
encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial
measure.
