                                                      3
game services gross profit was primarily due to increased net revenues from mobile games such as Life-After,
as well as certain PC-client games such as Justice and Fantasy Westward Journey Online.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in e-commerce gross profit were primarily due to the
increased sales volume of Kaola and Yanxuan, as well as continuously improved procurement and operation
processes.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality. The
year-over-year decrease in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue
contribution based on the evolving competitive macro-environment, and increased expenses related to staff

primarily due to increased net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music, NetEase CC and Youdao Online
Education, as well as better cost controls.

and 64.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter

67.0% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter

to gross loss margin of 13.1% and 7.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

                                                      4
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were RMB4,639.6 million (US$675.8 million),
compared to RMB4,681.6 million and RMB4,911.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a slight
decrease in staff-related costs, partially offset by increased marketing expenditures related to online game
services. The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to decreased marketing
expenditures related to NetEase’s online game services and e-commerce businesses, partially offset by
increased staff-related costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the
second quarter of 2019 were RMB388.2 million (US$56.6 million), compared to RMB404.6 million and
RMB386.6 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB685.2 million (US$99.8 million) for the second
quarter of 2019, compared to RMB1,269.0 million and RMB420.5 million for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 18.0%,
compared to 34.0% and 15.7% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The
lower effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the preceding quarter was mainly due to
reduced losses from certain subsidiaries as well as tax credits recognized for certain subsidiaries of the
Company.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the second quarter of 2019 totaled RMB3,071.4
million (US$447.4 million), compared to RMB2,382.1 million and RMB2,106.5 million for the preceding
quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders for the second quarter of 2019 totaled RMB3,645.4 million (US$531.0 million), compared to
RMB3,017.0 million and RMB2,724.9 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018,
respectively.

During the second quarter of 2019, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB24.0 million
(US$3.5 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB45.4 million and a net foreign exchange
gain of RMB232.8 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The changes
in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the
Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods, as well as certain foreign currency transactions.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.47 and US$3.44, respectively, for the second
quarter of 2019. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.71 and US$2.68,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.36 and US$2.35 for
the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$4.12 and US$4.09,
respectively, for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of


                                                     5
US$3.43 and US$3.40, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per
ADS of US$3.05 and US$3.04, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018.

Quarterly Dividend

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$1.04 per ADS for the second quarter of 2019, which is
expected to be paid on August 30, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 23,
2019.

dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 20%-30% of the Company’s anticipated net
income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of
such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be
based upon the Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

also expected that such repurchases will be affected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.
The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market
conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase’s
management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective as of December 31, 2018, the Company renamed its “e-mail and others” segment to “innovative
businesses and others” to better articulate the businesses included in this segment, there’s no change to the
business mix included in this segment. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game
services, e-commerce, advertising services and innovative businesses and others, and retrospectively revised
prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.

Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting Pronouncement

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases” as amended, which generally requires lessees to
recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet
and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified
retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately
RMB861.5 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its
consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The Company recognized RMB709.5 million and
RMB746.3 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases
on its consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term
assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables,
respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the
Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the net assets of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”

a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those

grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market within China or globally,
which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its
existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to effectively
market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that
changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-
commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline; the risk that
NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be
able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the risk that the e-commerce market or the
internet advertising market in China will not continue to grow and will remain subject to intense competition
and the risk that investments by us in our e-commerce platforms and related services or in our advertising
content and services may not increase the appeal of our websites, e-commerce platforms or mobile
applications among users or result in increased e-commerce or advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase will
not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase’s existing and potential markets;
governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its
subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the
non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability
may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
