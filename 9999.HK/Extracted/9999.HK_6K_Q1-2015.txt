                     NetEase Reports First Quarter 2015 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing – May 13, 2015) – NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES), one of China’s leading Internet and online
game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31,
2015.

“The introduction of new games and content for our community of online PC-client and mobile users drove
growth across our business during the first quarter of 2015,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer
and Director of NetEase. “Compared with the same period last year, revenues from our online games business
were up 44.0%.”

“Mobile games have become a major driving force in China’s online game industry, and we believe the high
quality and diversity of our mobile offerings are resonating with users. In the first quarter, a growing number
of users were particularly captivated by our self-developed mobile games, such as Battle to the West and The
World HD, which were launched in the prior quarter. Moreover, our flagship game, Fantasy Westward
Journey, continued to gain in popularity, with the mobile version of this game reaching No. 1 in the iOS China
app store, and setting a record peak concurrent user count of 1.6 million after its introduction in late March.”

“Our online PC-client games also continued to be well received in the first quarter as we introduced new
games and content. During the first quarter, users welcomed beta tests for Hegemon-King of Western Chu,
our 3D warfare MMORPG. We also saw solid performances from Fantasy Westward Journey II and New
Westward Journey Online II.”

“Our exciting pipeline planned for 2015 includes a number of new online PC-client and mobile games, as well
as new content for our existing games. In April, we commercially launched Demon Seals, a 2.5D MMORPG,
as well as expansion packs for New Westward Journey Online II and Ghost II. In addition, we are pleased
with the positive feedback from the closed beta testing of Revelation, our 3D oriental fantasy MMORPG,
which began in January, and we will launch its open beta testing in the near future. We also continue to work
closely with Blizzard Entertainment and have been delighted by the success of the open beta testing for the
Chinese version of Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls™. That game sold over one million copies within 10 days of

its launch in late April, setting the record for the fastest-selling PC game in China. We plan to begin open beta
testing for Blizzard’s Heroes of the Storm™ in late May. For mobile games, we now offer over 20 mobile
games of various genres, and we plan to deploy more new self-developed and licensed mobile titles in the
coming months to build on our positive momentum. Later this year, we will also expand our global footprint
with local partners to launch our games in other countries in Asia and North America.”

“Turning to our advertising services business, this segment remains strong	   benefiting from the continued
growth of our Mobile News Application and a growing online advertising market in China, with revenue from
this segment increasing by 35.9% compared with the same period last year. Automobile, Internet services and
food and beverage were the top performing advertising verticals in the first quarter. E-commerce is another
area where we see significant growth opportunity. While still in the early stages of operation, our self-operated
cross border e-commerce platform, Kaola, has performed well, and we are actively expanding our range of
product offerings.”

“Mobile games and content continue to be in high demand, further complementing our online PC-client games
and services. While we expect to see continued momentum from the mobile market, our strategy will remain
focused on diversity, excellence and international expansion to achieve healthy growth across all of our
Internet businesses,” Mr. Ding concluded.

First Quarter 2015 Financial Results

Revenues

Total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were RMB3,885.2 million (US$626.8 million), compared to
RMB3,683.6 million and RMB2,519.0 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014,
respectively.

Revenues from online games were RMB3,104.2 million (US$500.8 million) for the first quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB2,863.3 million and RMB2,155.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2014, respectively.

Revenues from advertising services were RMB332.6 million (US$53.7 million) for the first quarter of 2015,
compared to RMB404.5 million and RMB244.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014,
respectively.

Revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB448.4 million (US$72.3 million) for the first quarter
of 2015, compared to RMB415.8 million and RMB118.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter
of 2014, respectively.

Sales Taxes

Total sales taxes for the first quarter of 2015 were RMB225.0 million (US$36.3 million), compared to
RMB220.6 million and RMB153.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in sales taxes were mainly due to the increase in
NetEase’s total revenues.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was RMB2,489.1 million (US$401.5 million), compared to
RMB2,485.4 million and RMB1,707.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by the revenue contribution
from self-developed online games such as New Westward Journey Online II and Fantasy Westward Journey II,
and licensed games such as Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft®, as well as mobile games such as
Battle to the West, The World HD and the mobile version of Fantasy Westward Journey. The quarter-over-
quarter increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenue contribution from
NetEase’s mobile games Battle to the West, The World HD and the mobile version of Fantasy Westward
Journey.

The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to strong demand from the
automobile, Internet services and food and beverage sectors, and NetEase’s monetization efforts for its mobile
applications such as the Mobile News Application. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in advertising services
revenues and gross profit were primarily due to seasonality.

The year-over-year increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily attributable to an
increase from e-commerce services related to third-party lottery products. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in
e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily attributable to the temporary suspension of e-
commerce services related to third-party lottery products since late February 2015, which was partially offset
by an increase in revenues from NetEase's e-mail and other businesses in this segment.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the first quarter of 2015 was 73.1%, compared to 76.0%
and 78.5% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margin were mainly due to increased revenue contribution from
mobile games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online
games revenues.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the first quarter of 2015 was 59.2%, compared to
65.9% and 47.8% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-over-year
increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to enhanced economies of scale driven by revenue growth. The
quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the decrease of advertising services
revenues due to seasonality.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the first quarter of 2015 was 38.9%,
compared to 48.2% and 6.7% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively. The year-

over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue from e-commerce services
related to third-party lottery products, which has a relatively higher gross profit margin. The quarter-over-
quarter decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the fact that revenue from third-party
lottery products decreased as a percentage of total revenues for this segment due to the temporary suspension
discussed above.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2015 were RMB1,173.5 million (US$189.3 million),
compared to RMB1,239.7 million and RMB563.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of
2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and
marketing expenses for online PC-client and mobile games, promotions for the e-mail, e-commerce and others
business, as well as the advertising services business, and increased staff-related research and development
costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and average compensation. The quarter-over-
quarter decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to decreased promotional costs for online games and
advertising services.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB214.5 million (US$34.6 million) for the first quarter
of 2015, compared to RMB187.9 million and RMB179.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter
of 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 14.1%, compared to 12.8% and
13.8% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the first quarter of 2015 totaled RMB1.3 billion
(US$204.0 million), compared to RMB1.3 billion and RMB1.1 billion for the preceding quarter and the first
quarter of 2014, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholdersa for the first
quarter of 2015 totaled RMB1.4 billion (US$229.9 million), compared to RMB1.4 billion and RMB1.2 billion
for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively.

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB22.7 million (US$3.7
million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB7.1 million and a net foreign exchange gain of
RMB7.1 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2014, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year changes in foreign exchange gains/(losses) were mainly due to unrealized exchange
gains/(losses) arising from the Company’s foreign currency-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan
balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.56 and US$1.55, respectively, for the first
quarter of 2015. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.57 and US$1.56,

respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.39 each for the first
quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS was	  US$1.76 and US$1.74,	  respectively, for
the first quarter of 2015, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.72 and
US$1.71, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and US$1.46 each for the first quarter of 2014.

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.39 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2014 on March 6, 2015.

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.39 per ADS for the first quarter of 2015, which is
expected to be paid on June 5, 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 27, 2015. The
determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter
will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company’s operations and

Other Information

billion), compared to RMB21.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. Cash flow generated from operating
activities was RMB1.9 billion (US$310.6 million) for the first quarter of 2015, compared to RMB1.9 billion

Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, NetEase made a reclassification of certain revenue and cost of revenue
items from its advertising services segment to its e-mail, e-commerce and others segment. The segments
reclassification reflects changes in the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its
operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue

the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase’s

the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect
NetEase’s business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase’s filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information,

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results
without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure
facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be
incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures we use may differ from the non-
GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may
be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
