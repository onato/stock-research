Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were RMB23,159.1 million (US$3,457.6 million),
compared with RMB23,555.8 million and RMB20,524.5 million for the preceding quarter and the
second quarter of 2021, respectively.

Net revenues from games and related value-added services, which include both the operation of online
games as well as other related or ancillary services to the games, were RMB18,139.8 million
(US$2,708.2 million) for the second quarter of 2022, compared with RMB18,641.8 million and
RMB15,774.8 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively. Net
revenues from the operation of online games, which is the primary component of this segment,
accounted for approximately 92.8% of net revenues from games and related value-added services for
the second quarter of 2022, compared with 92.7% and 92.1% for the preceding quarter and the second
quarter of 2021, respectively. Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 66.1% of
net revenues from the operation of online games for the second quarter of 2022, compared with 66.9%
and 72.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB956.2 million (US$142.8 million) for the second quarter of 2022,
compared with RMB1,200.5 million and RMB1,293.4 million for the preceding quarter and the second
quarter of 2021, respectively.

Net revenues from Cloud Music were RMB2,191.5 million (US$327.2 million) for the second quarter
of 2022, compared with RMB2,067.2 million and RMB1,692.5 million for the preceding quarter and
the second quarter of 2021, respectively.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB1,871.5 million (US$279.4 million) for
the second quarter of 2022, compared with RMB1,646.3 million and RMB1,763.8 million for the
preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2022 was RMB12,941.5 million (US$1,932.1 million), compared
with RMB12,836.4 million and RMB11,189.6 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter
of 2021, respectively.

The year-over-year increase in games and related value-added services gross profit was primarily due
to increased net revenues from both mobile and PC games, including the newly launched Naraka:



                                                 3
Bladepoint and Harry Potter: Magic Awakened which were released in the third quarter of 2021 and
other existing games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in Youdao gross profit primarily resulted from a decline in economic
scale due to decreased learning services revenues in the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year
decrease was mainly due to the conclusion of its after-school tutoring services for academic subjects
under China’s compulsory education system.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Cloud Music gross profit were primarily due
to increased net revenues from its membership subscriptions and social entertainment services, as well
as improved cost control.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due
to increased gross profit contribution from Yanxuan and advertising services.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services for the second quarter of 2022 was
64.9%, compared with 62.2% and 63.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021,
respectively. Gross profit margin for games and related value-added services is generally stable,
fluctuating within a narrow band based on the revenue mix of NetEase’s mobile and PC games, self-
developed, co-developed and licensed games, as well as the relative revenue contribution from
different distribution channels.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the second quarter of 2022 was 42.8%, compared with 53.1% and
52.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year decreases were primarily attributable to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for Cloud Music was 13.0% for the second quarter of 2022, compared with 12.2%
and 4.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year improvements were mainly due to the factors enumerated above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the second quarter of 2022 was 25.8%,
compared with 21.7% and 27.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively.
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year fluctuations were mainly due to changes in the gross profit
margin from advertising services.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were RMB7,995.2 million (US$1,193.6
million), compared with RMB7,329.3 million and RMB7,431.5 million for the preceding quarter and
the second quarter of 2021, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were
mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to games and related value-added services, as
well as higher staff-related costs and research and development investments.

                                                  4
Other Income/ (Expenses)

Other income/ (expenses) consisted of investment income/ (loss), interest income, exchange gains/
(losses) and others. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to net unrealized exchange gains
arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and loans balances as the exchange
rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated in the second quarter of 2022.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB1,259.3 million (US$188.0 million) for the
second quarter of 2022, compared with RMB1,219.3 million and RMB1,113.2 million for the
preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second
quarter of 2022 was 22.0%, compared with 22.0% and 24.3% for the preceding quarter and the second
quarter of 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to
the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

Net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled
RMB4,666.6 million (US$696.7 million) for the second quarter of 2022, compared with RMB4,394.0
million and RMB3,541.8 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively.
Net income from discontinued operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled
RMB624.9 million (US$93.3 million), which was related to the disposal of the Kaola business.

Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders totaled
RMB5,409.8 million (US$807.7 million) for the second quarter of 2022, compared with RMB5,117.6
million and RMB4,227.9 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021, respectively.

NetEase reported basic net income from continuing operations of US$0.21 per share (US$1.07 per
ADS) for the second quarter of 2022, compared with US$0.20 per share (US$1.00 per ADS) and
US$0.16 per share (US$0.79 per ADS) for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2021,
respectively.

NetEase reported non-GAAP basic net income from continuing operations of US$0.25 per share
(US$1.23 per ADS) for the second quarter of 2022, compared with US$0.23 per share (US$1.17 per
ADS) and US$0.19 per share (US$0.94 per ADS) for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of
2021, respectively.

Quarterly Dividend

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.0720 per share (US$0.3600 per ADS) for the
second quarter of 2022 to holders of ordinary shares and holders of ADSs as of the close of business

dollars. For holders of ordinary shares, in order to qualify for the dividend, all valid documents for the

                                                    5
transfer of shares accompanied by the relevant share certificates must be lodged for registration with
the Company’s Hong Kong branch share registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services
Limited, at Shops 1712-1716, 17th Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen’s Road East, Wanchai, Hong

June 2022.

Under the Company’s current dividend policy, the determination to make dividend distributions and
the amount of such distribution in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of its board of
directors and will be based upon the Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition
and other relevant factors.

Other Information

As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time
deposits and restricted cash, as well as short-term investments balance, minus short-term and long-term
loans totaled RMB87.7 billion (US$13.1 billion), compared with RMB85.6 billion as of December 31,
2021. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB6.6 billion (US$990.0 million) for the
second quarter of 2022, compared with RMB4.6 billion and RMB4.7 billion for the preceding quarter
and the second quarter of 2021, respectively.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective as of the second quarter of 2022, the Company implemented certain changes to align its
segment financial reporting more closely with the manner in which the Company’s management
currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance
of reporting segments. The Company renamed its “online game services” segment as “games and
related value-added services,” and transferred certain business lines that are related or ancillary to its
games from “innovative businesses and others” to “games and related value-added services,” including
the NetEase CC live streaming service (a platform offering various live streaming content with a
primary focus on game broadcasting) and other value-added services. The Company retrospectively
recast prior periods’ segment information to conform to current period presentation. These changes
had no impact on NetEase’s previously reported consolidated net revenues, net income or net income
per share.


Share Repurchase/ Purchase Program

On February 25, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share
repurchase program of up to US$2.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs and ordinary shares
in open market transactions for a period not to exceed 24 months beginning on March 2, 2021. On

                                                    6
August 31, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved an amendment to
such program to increase the total authorized repurchase amount to US$3.0 billion. As of June 30,
2022, approximately 23.6 million ADSs had been repurchased under this program for a total cost of
US$2.3 billion.

On August 31, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share purchase
program of up to US$50.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 36 months
beginning on September 2, 2021. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao’s
ADSs in open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. As of June 30, 2022,
approximately 1.7 million ADSs had been purchased under this program for a total cost of US$17.7
million.

The Company also purchased approximately 0.8 million ordinary shares of Cloud Music in open
market transactions on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for a total cost of US$8.3 million during the
second quarter of 2022.

The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs and its ordinary shares or purchases Youdao’s
ADSs and Cloud Music’s ordinary shares will depend upon a variety of factors, including market
conditions. These programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

that are not historical facts, including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its
expectations regarding the growth of its business and its revenue and the quotations from management
in this announcement are or contain forward-looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-
looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong
Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by
its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted
by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not
continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its position in that market in China or
globally; the risk that COVID-19 or other health risks in China or globally could adversely affect the
Company’s operations or financial results; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating
strategies and its ability to implement such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its
operations and business; competition for, among other things, capital, technology and skilled
personnel; potential changes in government regulation that could adversely affect the industry and
geographical markets in which NetEase operates, including, among others, initiatives to enhance
supervision of companies listed on an overseas stock exchange and tighten scrutiny over data privacy
and data security, as well as the risk that NetEase’s ADSs could be barred from trading in the United
States as a result of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online
services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market;
competition in NetEase’s existing and potential markets; and the risk that fluctuations in the value of
the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase’s business and financial
results. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in NetEase’s filings with the

                                                   8
SEC and announcements on the website of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. NetEase does not
undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the
applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted
net income from continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing
and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders
excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating
results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses. NetEase believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and
evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as
management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial
measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key
limitations of using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-
based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and
are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable
to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore
their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure,
all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited
Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase
encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial
measure.
