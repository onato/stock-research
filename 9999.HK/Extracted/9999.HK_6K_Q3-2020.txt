Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were RMB18,658.2 million (US$2,748.1 million), compared to
RMB18,184.8 million and RMB14,635.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019,
respectively.

Net revenues from online game services were RMB13,862.0 million (US$2,041.7 million) for the third quarter
of 2020, compared to RMB13,828.3 million and RMB11,534.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2019, respectively. Net revenues from mobile games accounted for approximately 72.7% of net
revenues from online games for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 72.3% and 71.0% for the preceding
quarter and the third quarter of 2019, respectively.

Net revenues from Youdao were RMB896.0 million (US$132.0 million) for the third quarter of 2020,
compared to RMB623.3 million and RMB345.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019,
respectively.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB3,900.1 million (US$574.4 million) for the
third quarter of 2020, compared to RMB3,733.3 million and RMB2,755.0 million for the preceding quarter
and the third quarter of 2019, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2020 was RMB9,885.8 million (US$1,456.0 million), compared to
RMB9,792.2 million and RMB7,870.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019,
respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter gross profit in online game services was generally stable. The year-over-year
increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from self-developed games such as Fantasy Westward
Journey H5, Life-After and Knives Out, as well as certain licensed games.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Youdao gross profit were primarily attributable to
the significant increase in net revenues, improved economies of scale, and faculty compensation structure
optimization for its learning services and products.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in innovative businesses and others gross profit was primarily due to
decreased gross profit from advertising services. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased
net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music.


                                                     3
Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2020 was 63.6%, compared to 63.8% each
for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019. Gross profit margin for online game services was
generally stable, fluctuating within a narrow band based on the revenue mix of mobile and PC games, as well
as self-developed and licensed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the third quarter of 2020 was 45.9%, compared to 45.2% and 25.8% for
the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter gross profit margin
was comparatively stable. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the factors enumerated
above.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the third quarter of 2020 was 16.8%, compared to
18.5% and 15.2% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter decrease was primarily due to decreased gross profit margin from advertising services. The year-over-
year increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from NetEase Cloud Music.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were RMB7,015.7 million (US$1,033.3 million),
compared to RMB5,622.3 million and RMB4,535.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were mainly due to increased
marketing expenditures related to Youdao and online game services, as well as higher staff-related costs and
research and development investments.

Other Income

Other income consisted of investment income, interest income, exchange gains/ (losses) and others. The
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to net exchange losses of RMB1,571.3
million (US$231.4 million) recorded in the third quarter of 2020, which were mainly related to net unrealized
exchange losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan
balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods. Such unrealized
exchange losses were partially offset by increased investment income arising from fair value changes of equity
investments with readily determinable fair value.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB342.7 million (US$50.5 million) for the third quarter
of 2020, compared to RMB1,064.5 million and RMB88.0 million for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 10.9%, compared to
18.6% and 2.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate
represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each
quarter, and the rate for the third quarter of 2020 was affected by certain tax credits received and recognized
during the quarter.


                                                      4
Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income

2020 totaled RMB2,998.2 million (US$441.6 million), which includes net exchange losses of RMB1,571.3

quarter and the third quarter of 2019, respectively.

respectively, for the third quarter of 2020, compared to US$1.19 and US$1.17, respectively, for the preceding

net income from continuing operations per share were US$0.16 each for the third quarter of 2020, compared to
US$0.24 and US$0.23, respectively, for the preceding quarter and US$0.22 and US$0.21, respectively, for the

2020, and paid a dividend of US$0.2970 per ADS (US$0.0594 per share) for the second quarter of 2020 in

Share Purchase / Repurchase Program

On November 20, 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share purchase
program of up to US$20.0 million of Youdao’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on November 25, 2019. Under the terms of this program, NetEase may purchase Youdao’s ADSs in
open-market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. As of September 30, 2020, approximately
198,000 ADSs had been purchased under this program for a total cost of US$3.4 million.

On February 26, 2020, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase
program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on March 2, 2020. On May 19, 2020, the Company announced that its board of directors had

forward-looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,”

including statements about NetEase’s strategies and business plans, its expectations regarding the growth of its

looking statements. NetEase may also make forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in announcements made on the website of The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong Kong Stock Exchange”), in press releases and other written
materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. The accuracy of

affect the Company’s operations or financial results; risks associated with NetEase’s business and operating
strategies and its ability to implement such strategies; NetEase’s ability to develop and manage its operations


                                                       7
and business; competition for, among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel; potential changes
in government regulation that could adversely affect the industry and geographical markets in which NetEase
operates; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or
that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; competition in
NetEase’s existing and potential markets; and the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with
respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase’s business and financial results. Further information

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from
continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating
performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding
share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the
Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the
impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the
Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so
choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it
does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of
non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which
should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
