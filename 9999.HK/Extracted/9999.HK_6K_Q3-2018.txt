third quarter, net revenues for our online games stood above RMB10 billion for the second consecutive quarter,
supported by a game portfolio that is more diversified than ever before.
“While the performances from our flagship titles remain remarkably steady, we are innovators at our core.
NetEase is one of the very few companies that has consistently created distinct new game IP for both PC-client

about our collaboration with Blizzard to bring one of their biggest games to mobile players, increasing our
visibility and expanding our foothold in the global online games market.

“Our e-commerce business grew 67.2% year-over-year in the third quarter, well outpacing the industry average.
While we continue to grow this business, we are maintaining a disciplined approach to spending.

this partnership in place we are ready to take the business to the next level,” concluded Mr. Ding.

Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB16,855.3 million (US$2,454.2 million), compared to
RMB16,283.9 million and RMB12,477.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB10,348.4 million (US$1,506.8 million) for the third quarter of 2018,
compared to RMB10,060.8 million and RMB8,111.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2017, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 68.0% of net revenues from online games for
the third quarter of 2018, compared to 74.7% and 68.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017,
respectively.

Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB4,458.8 million (US$649.2 million) for the third quarter of 2018,
compared to RMB4,365.5 million and RMB2,667.5 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2017, respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB644.2 million (US$93.8 million) for the third quarter of 2018,
compared to RMB634.1 million and RMB631.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017,
respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the third quarter of 2018 were automobile, real estate
and internet services sectors.

Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,403.8 million (US$204.4 million) for the third quarter of 2018,
compared to RMB1,223.5 million and RMB1,067.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of
2017, respectively.




                                                       3
Gross Profit/ (Loss)

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was RMB7,547.3 million (US$1,098.9 million), compared to
RMB7,245.1 million and RMB5,947.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue
contribution from self-developed mobile games such as Chu Liu Xiang, Knives Out and Identity V and PC-client
games such as Justice and Fantasy Westward Journey Online. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game
services gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from PC-client games such as Justice,
and partially offset by the decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games.

The year-over-year increase in e-commerce gross profit was primarily due to the rapid development of Kaola
and Yanxuan.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in advertising services gross profit were primarily due to
higher staff-related costs and content purchase expenditures.

The year-over-year increase in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution
from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher
recognized costs related to certain licensed music content. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail and others
gross loss was primarily due to higher revenue contribution from NetEase Cloud Music and certain online
platform businesses.

Gross Profit/ (Loss) Margin

Gross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2018 was 65.1%, compared to 64.3% and
62.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross
profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue, while certain costs related to the Company’s online games
segment were fixed. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased
revenue contribution from PC-client games, which have relatively higher gross profit margins than mobile
games.

Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the third quarter of 2018 was 10.0%, compared to 10.1% and 11.5% for
the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce
gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the third quarter of 2018 to support the rapid
development of Kaola and Yanxuan.

Gross profit margin for advertising services for the third quarter of 2018 was 63.6%, compared to 67.0% and
68.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-
over-quarter decreases in gross profit margins were mainly due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase
expenditures.




                                                        4
Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the third quarter of 2018 was 3.3%, compared to gross loss margin
of 7.3% and gross profit margin of 13.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.
The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain
online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs
related to certain licensed music content in the third quarter of 2018. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in
e-mail and others gross margin was primarily due to higher revenue contribution from NetEase Cloud Music
and certain online platform businesses.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB5,440.1 million (US$792.1 million), compared
to RMB4,911.5 million and RMB3,397.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017,
respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to
increased staff-related costs, research and development investments and marketing expenditures. Shipping and
handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB385.5 million
(US$56.1 million), compared to RMB386.6 million and RMB294.8 million for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2017, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB843.8 million (US$122.9 million) for the third quarter
of 2018, compared to RMB420.5 million and RMB225.5 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter
of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 34.2%, compared to 15.7% and
8.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. Certain subsidiaries of the Company
are recognized as Key Software Enterprises and therefore subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for the relevant
fiscal years. The Company then recognizes such tax credits in the quarters when they are received. The year-
over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the recognition of such
tax credits. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and
benefits applicable to it in each quarter.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the third quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1.6 billion
(US$232.4 million), compared to RMB2.1 billion and RMB2.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the third
quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the third
quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.3 billion (US$328.9 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and RMB3.0 billion
for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB56.1 million (US$8.2
million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB232.8 million and a net foreign exchange loss of
RMB109.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains
and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as
the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.


                                                        5
NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.81 and US$1.80, respectively, for the third quarter
of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.36 and US$2.35, respectively, for
the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.79 and US$2.77, respectively, for the
third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$2.56 and US$2.55, respectively,
for the third quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.05 and
US$3.04, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.34
and US$3.32, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017.

Quarterly Dividend

The board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.45 per ADS for the third quarter of 2018, which is
expected to be paid on December 7, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 30,
2018.

NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2017 on March 2, 2018, a dividend of
US$0.23 per ADS for the first quarter of 2018 on June 8, 2018 and a dividend of US$0.61 per ADS for the
second quarter of 2018 on August 31, 2018.

Under the Company’s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at
an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company’s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal
quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular
quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company’s operations
and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Other Information

As of September 30, 2018, the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits
and short-term investments balance totaled RMB42.6 billion (US$6.2 billion), compared to RMB43.2 billion as
of December 31, 2017. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB3.6 billion (US$526.7 million)
for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB2.0 billion and RMB1.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the
third quarter of 2017, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

On November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase
program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months
beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors
approved an amendment to its share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional
US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs. This expands the US$1.0 billion repurchase program that
was approved on November 15, 2017 for a period not to exceed 12 months, bringing the total authorized
repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion.




                                                       6
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 4.5 million ADSs for approximately
US$1,168 million under this program.

The Company also announced today that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program
of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on
November 16, 2018.

Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in
open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase
transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is
also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.
The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market
conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase’s
management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the
convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of
the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8680 on September 28, 2018 as set forth
in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB
amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on September 28, 2018, or at any other
certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.

Change in Segment Reporting

Effective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the
financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from
e-commerce to the Company’s total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the
results of NetEase’s two e-commerce platforms, Kaola and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015
and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-
commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner
in which the Company’s operating decision maker (“CODM”) currently receives and uses financial information
to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation
does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of
cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period
presentation.

Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncements

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the
modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately
RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as
a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the
Company’s operating results for the third quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.



                                                       7
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-
10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”, and reclassified RMB38.2
million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company’s available-for-sale equity securities that
existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company recorded
net investment losses of RMB238.4 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair
value for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Given that there were no material observable price changes
in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record
any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018.

The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18 “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash” starting
from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted
cash increased by an aggregate of RMB22.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, compared to the amounts
presented under previous guidance.

looking statements by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,”
“believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number
of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or
anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that
NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its
new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular
as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability
of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing
expenditures; the risk that NetEase’s affiliates will not be able to continue operating Minecraft, World of
Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls™, Heroes of the Storm®, Overwatch® or
other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk
that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government
regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase’s e-commerce businesses may limit future
growth of NetEase’s revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and
the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase
websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able
to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the
popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that
NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase’s existing and potential

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income
attributable to the Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without
considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes
that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating
the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if
they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using
non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense
that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in
our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP
measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s
shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when
evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of
this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a
single financial measure.

*In 2018, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2016-18 issued by FASB in November 2016, which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change
during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, the Company
included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.
Pursuant to the guidance, the Company retropsectively restated the statement of cash flows in the comparative periods.
