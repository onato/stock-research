          NetEase Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Unaudited Financial Results

(Beijing – February 15, 2017) - NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) (“NetEase” or the “Company”), one of
China’s leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results
for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

“We achieved growth across our business in 2016 as we continued to introduce internet content to entertain
and inspire our community, growing our total net revenues by 67.4% for the year and 53.1% for the fourth
quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2015,” said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director
of NetEase. “Led by mobile games, we saw year-over-year net revenue increases in the fourth quarter of 62.8%
from online games, 9.2% from advertising services, and 38.2% from our e-mail, e-commerce and others
segment.”

“With more than 40 new mobile titles in 2016, we have introduced a number of chart toppers to China’s
thriving mobile market. In the fourth quarter, our self-developed mobile games Onmyoji, Tianxia III mobile
and OverOcean, as well as HIT, a stunning new licensed ARPG, delivered outstanding performances. In
particular, Onmyoji was named one of the top 10 outstanding games of 2016 in China’s iOS app store. To
leverage this game’s early success, we began our international release of Onmyoji in Southeast Asia in
December, with plans to roll out this game in Japan, Canada, Europe and the United States later this year. The
Westward Journey Online and Fantasy Westward Journey mobile games and the mobile version of New Ghost
also continued their popularity in the fourth quarter.”

“There remains massive opportunity within the mobile market, and we will continue to build our formidable
and diverse pipeline. Currently, our mobile portfolio stands strong with more than 100 games, and we plan to
add more mobile versions of our legacy titles and new self-developed and licensed mobile games to further
this momentum. Recently, we released new mobile games including Demon Seals mobile and Heroes of Tang
Dynasty mobile, both of which were well received. Other new mobile titles planned for near-term introduction
include Westward Journey: Rage, an exciting ARPG edition to celebrate the 15th anniversary of this title, and
Treasure Hunter, an innovative RPG.”


                                                      1
“Our PC-client games performed steadily in the fourth quarter with a strong showing from our flagship game
Fantasy Westward Journey Online. We released several new expansion packs during the fourth quarter to
satisfy our PC-client game players, including Kung Fu Master II, Demon Seals, Tianxia III, Heroes of Tang
Dynasty Zero and New Ghost. New expansion packs for Fantasy Westward Journey Online and Revelation
were also recently released, and we expect to introduce a new expansion pack for New Westward Journey
Online II in the coming months.”

“Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch®, World of Warcraft®, with its latest expansion pack Legion™, and
Hearthstone® with its latest expansion pack Mean Streets of Gadgetzan™ also remained popular among loyal
players in China eager for new content, as well as brought in new players. Overwatch also established a new
sales record in the category of buy-to-play PC-client games in mainland China, with more than 5 million
copies sold by the end of December since its late May release. Furthermore, we are currently working to bring
to Chinese players both PC and mobile versions of the highly anticipated, globally acclaimed game,
Minecraft.”

“As data consumption mediums evolve, the internet, especially the mobile internet, is becoming the primary
advertising platform in China. This trend supports the steady growth of our advertising services business.
Driven primarily by our Mobile News App, as well as high-profile events such as the 2016 NetEase Annual
Economist Summit and the 2016 NetEase Annual Attitude Award Ceremony, our top performing advertising
verticals in the fourth quarter were automobile, internet services and financial services. Additionally, our e-
commerce business continues to thrive with both Kaola.com and Yanxuan maintaining healthy growth in the
fourth quarter.”

“Our focus on innovation and quality has served us well, enabling NetEase to create significant value for each
of our major constituencies: our players, our partners and our shareholders. In 2016, we brought best-in-class
products and services to our community and continued to grow our business. As we move through 2017 we
will look toward the future, designing products and services that address fluid market dynamics, enabling
continued growth and value creation,” Mr. Ding concluded.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were RMB12,099.0 million (US$1,742.6 million), compared to
RMB9,211.6 million and RMB7,903.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015,
respectively.

Net revenues from online games were RMB8,959.1 million (US$1,290.4 million) for the fourth quarter of
2016, compared to RMB6,568.0 million and RMB5,502.9 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth
quarter of 2015, respectively.

Net revenues from advertising services were RMB664.8 million (US$95.8 million) for the fourth quarter of
2016, compared to RMB563.3 million and RMB609.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter
of 2015, respectively.

Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB2,475.1 million (US$356.5 million) for the
fourth quarter of 2016, compared to RMB2,080.4 million and RMB1,791.1 million for the preceding quarter
and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was RMB6,463.3 million (US$930.9 million), compared to
RMB5,333.6 million and RMB4,219.7 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015,
respectively.

The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenue
contribution from mobile games such as Onmyoji and the mobile version of New Ghost, as well as Blizzard
Entertainment’s Overwatch and World of Warcraft. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game gross
profit was primarily driven by increased revenue contribution from mobile games such as Onmyoji and the
mobile version of New Ghost.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily
attributable to NetEase’s monetization efforts for its mobile applications, primarily its Mobile News App. The
top performing advertising verticals in the fourth quarter were automobile, internet services and financial
services.

The year-over-year increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to increased
revenue contribution from NetEase’s e-commerce business, such as Kaola.com. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution
from certain NetEase e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins.




                                                      3
Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin for the online games business for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 60.7%, compared to
65.0% and 67.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games and
licensed games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase’s total online
games revenues. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the one-off
recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as
increased revenue contribution from mobile games.

Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 66.5%, compared
to 65.3% and 68.1% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher staff-related costs.

Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 23.4%,
compared to 33.5% and 6.0% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-
over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in gross profit margin were primarily attributable to changes in
NetEase’s e-commerce business mix.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were RMB2,596.6 million (US$374.0 million),
compared to RMB2,487.0 million and RMB1,801.7 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2015, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher staff-related
costs resulting from an increase in headcount, average compensation, research and development investments
and selling and marketing expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due
to higher staff-related costs and research and development investments, which was partially offset by
decreased selling and marketing expenses.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB882.0 million (US$127.0 million) for the fourth
quarter of 2016, compared to RMB427.2 million and RMB513.8 million for the preceding quarter and the
fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 19.2%, compared
to 13.3% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The quarter-over-
quarter change in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company
were approved as Key Software Enterprises in 2016 and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2015. The
Company recognized certain related tax credits in the third quarter of 2016.

Net Income After Tax

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled RMB3.7 billion
(US$530.5 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and RMB2.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth
quarter of 2015, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders[1] for the


                                                      4
fourth quarter of 2016 totaled RMB4.0 billion (US$569.9 million), compared to RMB3.0 billion and RMB2.4
billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB90.5 million
(US$13.0 million), compared to net foreign exchange gains of RMB14.8 million and RMB66.3 million for the
preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The net foreign exchange gains were mainly
due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank
deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over
the periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.04 and US$4.01, respectively, for the fourth
quarter of 2016. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.01 and US$2.99,
respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.37 and US$2.35,
respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP[1] basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$4.34
and US$4.30, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings
per ADS of US$3.31 and US$3.29, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted
earnings per ADS of US$2.58 and US$2.56, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015.

for fiscal year 2016, compared to RMB3.7 billion for the preceding fiscal year.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for fiscal year 2016 was RMB21.7 billion (US$3.1 billion), compared to RMB13.4 billion for the
preceding fiscal year.

The increase in online game services gross profit in 2016 was primarily attributable to increased revenue
contribution from the Company’s self-developed mobile games such as the Westward Journey Online and
Fantasy Westward Journey mobile games, Onmyoji and the mobile version of New Ghost, as well as licensed
games such as Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch.

The increase in advertising services gross profit in 2016 was due to NetEase’s monetization efforts for its
mobile applications, primarily its Mobile News App. The top performing advertising verticals in fiscal year
2016 were automobile, internet services and telecommunication services.

The increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit in 2016 was primarily due to business development
and gross profit margin improvement of certain NetEase e-commerce businesses.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 were RMB9.0 billion (US$1.3 billion), compared to RMB6.1
billion for the preceding fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses in 2016 was primarily due to increased
selling and marketing expenses, higher research and development investments and higher staff-related costs
resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB2.1 billion (US$302.8 million) and RMB1.3 billion
for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate was 15.1% for fiscal year 2016, compared

million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB133.8 million for the preceding fiscal year. The net
foreign exchange gains were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company’s
U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposit and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar
against the RMB fluctuated over these periods.

NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$12.73 and US$12.63, respectively, for fiscal year
2016, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$7.38 and US$7.34, respectively, for fiscal year 2015.

Company’s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.

On September 1, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase

approximately US$205.3 million under this program.

** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the
convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience
of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.9430 on December 30, 2016 as set

Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial
statements and related notes to be included in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
December 31, 2016 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been
completed, the Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the
end of fiscal year 2016.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could
result in significant differences between the Company’s audited financial statements and this preliminary
unaudited financial information.

a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those

positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue
operating World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls™, Heroes of the

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in
reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders as net income attributable
to the Company’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term
investment of available-for-sale securities. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders
enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based
compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities, which are
non-cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating
performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also
believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating
performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of
expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term
investment of available-for-sale securities have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are
not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In
addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by
other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the
Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered
when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the
end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely
on a single financial measure.
