RMB9,885.8 million and RMB8,210.4 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019,

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in online game services gross profit was mainly due to slightly decreased
net revenues from certain mobile games. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased net
revenues from mobile games such as Fantasy Westward Journey H5, Sky, Life-After and Invincible, as well as
PC games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in Youdao gross profit were primarily due to increased
net revenues from its learning services and learning products.

increased gross profit from advertising services and Yanxuan. The year-over-year increase was primarily due
to improved performances from Yanxuan and NetEase Cloud Music.

and 63.1% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. Gross profit margin for

mobile and PC games, as well as self-developed and licensed games.

Gross profit margin for Youdao for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 47.5%, compared to 45.9% and 29.8% for
the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year
increases were mainly due to improved economies of scale and the continuous optimization of Youdao’s
faculty compensation structure, as well as substantially increased sales volume of Youdao Dictionary Pen,
which has a comparatively higher gross profit margin.

Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 18.0%, compared
to 16.8% and 20.6% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were RMB6,915.8 million (US$1,059.9 million),
compared to RMB7,015.7 million and RMB5,234.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of
2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decreased marketing expenditures
related to Youdao. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to
online game services and Youdao, as well as higher staff-related costs and research and development
investments.

Other Income

Other income consisted of investment income/ (loss), interest income, exchange losses and others. The
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were mainly due to higher unrealized exchange losses
arising from the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods, as well as investment loss
arising from fair value changes of equity investments with readily determinable fair value.

Income Taxes

The Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB552.7 million (US$84.7 million) for the fourth
quarter of 2020, compared to RMB342.7 million and RMB876.3 million for the preceding quarter and the

to 10.9% and 22.1% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. The effective tax

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

NetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income from continuing
operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income from
continuing operations per ADS and per share, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating
performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

NetEase defines non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s
shareholders as net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders excluding
share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the
Company’s shareholders enables NetEase’s management to assess its operating results without considering the
impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the
Company’s current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so
choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors’
assessment of its operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of
using non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders is that it
does not reflect all items of expense/ income that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses
have been and may continue to be incurred in NetEase’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of
non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the
non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to the Company’s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which
should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. See “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this announcement. NetEase encourages you to review its financial
information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
