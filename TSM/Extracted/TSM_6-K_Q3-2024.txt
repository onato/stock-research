INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated statements of changes in equity and cash flows for the nine months then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated financial statements based on our reviews.

Scope of Review

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the Standards on Review Engagements of the Republic of China 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Conclusion

Based on our reviews, nothing has come to our attention that caused us to believe that the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, its consolidated financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers, and International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China.

•The statement of profit or loss shall present totals and subtotals for operating profit or loss, profit or loss before financing and income taxes and profit or loss.

•Provides guidance to enhance the requirements of aggregation and disaggregation: The Company shall identify the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows that arise from individual transactions or other events and shall classify and aggregate them into groups based on shared characteristics, so as to result in the presentation in the primary financial statements of line items that have at least one similar characteristic. The Company shall disaggregate items with dissimilar characteristics in the primary financial statements and in the notes. The Company labels items as ”other” only if it cannot find a more informative label.

Except for the above impact, as of the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued, the Company continues in evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance from the initial adoption of the aforementioned standards or interpretations and related applicable period.

This transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction since the transaction did not change TSMC’s control over ESMC.

Retirement Benefits

Pension cost for an interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis by using the actuarially determined pension cost rate at the end of the prior financial year.

- 11 -


Taxation

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The interim period income tax expense is accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings, that is, the estimated average annual effective income tax rate applied to the pre-tax income of the interim period.

(Concluded)

Fair value hedge

The Company entered into interest rate futures contracts, which are used to partially hedge against the fair value changes caused by interest rate fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.

On the basis of economic relationships, the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses, net.

The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risks.

Cash flow hedge

The Company entered into forward contracts to partially hedge foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.

On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Refer to Note 19 (d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged item affects profit or loss, and the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations

TSMC has designated the bank loans denominated in foreign currency as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage its foreign currency risk arising from investment in overseas subsidiaries.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the material difference between the notional amount of bank loans denominated in foreign currency and the net investment in foreign operations. No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Refer to Note 19 (d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments.

The Company signed a contract with the bank to sell certain accounts receivable without recourse and transaction cost required. These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.

(Concluded)

The significant part of the Company’s buildings includes main plants, mechanical and electrical power equipment and clean rooms, and the related depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful lives of 20 years, 10 years and 10 years, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recognized an impairment loss due to partial plant facilities and machinery and equipment damage caused by an earthquake, which rendered them unusable. Please refer to the related earthquake losses in Note 34.

Information about capitalized interest is set out in Note 22.

If such capital surplus is distributed as transferred to share capital, it is limited to a certain percentage of the Company’s paid-in capital each year.


c.    Retained earnings and dividend policy

TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation.

TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.

The legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.

Pursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside an additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders’ equity, such as the accumulated balance of the foreign currency translation reserve, the effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders’ equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.

Vesting conditions of the aforementioned arrangement are as follow:

1)    The RSAs granted to eligible employees can only be vested if

•the employee remains employed by the Company on the last date of each vesting period;

•during the vesting period, the employee may not breach any agreement with the Company or violate the Company’s work rules; and

•certain employee performance metrics and TSMC’s business performance metrics are met.


- 34 -


2)    The maximum percentage of granted RSAs that may be vested each year shall be as follows: one-year anniversary of the grant: 50%; two-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; and three-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; provided that the actual percentage and number of the RSAs to be vested in each year will be calculated based on the achievement of TSMC’s business performance metrics.

3)    For eligible executive officers of TSMC: The maximum number of RSAs that may be vested in each year will be set as 110%, among which 100% will be subject to a calculation based on TSMC’s relative Total Shareholder Return (”TSR”, including capital gains and dividends) achievement to determine the number of RSAs to be vested; this number will be further subject to a modifier to increase or decrease up to 10% based on the Compensation and People Development Committee’s evaluation of TSMC’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (”ESG”) achievements. The number of shares so calculated should be rounded down to the nearest integral.

4)    Restrictions imposed on the employees’ rights in the RSAs before the vesting conditions are fulfilled:

•During each vesting period, no employee granted RSAs, except for inheritance, may sell, pledge, transfer, give to another person, create any encumbrance on, or otherwise dispose of, any shares under the unvested RSAs.

•Before the vesting conditions are fulfilled, the attendance, proposal rights, speech rights, voting rights and etc. shall be exercised by the engaged trustee/custodian on the employee’s behalf. Any other shareholder rights including but not limited to the entitlement to any distribution regarding dividends, bonuses and capital reserve, and the subscription right of the new shares issued for any capital increase, are the same as those of holders of common shares of TSMC.

b.    Financial risk management objectives

The Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.

The plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.


c.    Market risk

The Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.

Foreign currency risk

Substantially all the Company’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.

Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$4,748,405 thousand and NT$362,316 thousand respectively.

Interest rate risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.

The majority of the Company’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI or at amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in the carrying amount. Both classifications recognized in profit or loss if the assets are sold. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.

- 40 -



Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company’s other comprehensive income by NT$4,473,470 thousand and NT$3,887,322 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The majority of the Company’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.

Other price risk

The Company is exposed to convertible preferred stocks, equity instrument investments, and other investments price risk arising from financial assets at FVTPL and FVTOCI.

Assuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the investments mentioned above at the end of the reporting period, the net income would have decreased by NT$1,167,572 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$1,148,393 thousand and NT$925,125 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.


d.    Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.

Business related credit risk

The Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 88%, 91% and 85% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.

Financial credit risk

The Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.

The objective of the Company’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested securities since initial recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material information of the issuers.


- 41 -


The Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the probability of default and loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies. The current credit risk assessment policies are as follows:






















Category

Description

Basis for Recognizing Expected Credit Loss

Expected Credit Loss Ratio







Performing

Credit rating is investment grade on valuation date

12 months expected credit loss

0-0.1%
Doubtful

Credit rating is non-investment grade on valuation date

In default

Credit rating is CC or below on valuation date

Lifetime expected credit loss-credit impaired

-
Write-off

There is evidence indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and the Company has no realistic prospect of recovery

Amount is written off

-

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the expected credit loss increased NT$38,190 thousand and NT$46,881 thousand, respectively. The changes were mainly due to adjusted investment portfolio and fluctuations in exchange rates.


e.    Liquidity risk management

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTOCI-current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.

The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.

f.     Fair value of financial instruments

1) Fair value measurements recognized in the consolidated balance sheets

Fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

•Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

•Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The timing of transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy is at the end of reporting period.

2) Fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Fair value hierarchy

Note:    The transfer from level 3 to level 1 is because quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets data became available for the equity investments.

Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 2 fair value measurement

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

•The fair values of corporate bonds, agency bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and government bonds are determined by quoted market prices provided by third party pricing services.

•The fair values of forward contracts are measured using forward rates and discount rates derived from quoted market prices.

•The fair value of accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI is determined by the present value of future cash flows based on the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.

Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 3 fair value measurement

The fair values of convertible preferred stocks, convertible bonds, simple agreement for future equity, mutual funds and non-publicly traded equity investments (excluding those trading on the Emerging Stock Board) are mainly determined by using the asset approach, income approach and market approach.

The asset approach takes into account the net asset value measured at the fair value by independent parties. On September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$53,470 thousand, NT$52,704 thousand and NT$59,572 thousand, respectively, if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.

The income approach utilizes discounted cash flows to determine the present value of the expected future economic benefits that will be derived from the investment. On September 30, 2024, the Company mainly uses unobservable inputs, which include expected returns, discount rate of 7.9%, and discount for lack of marketability of 20%. On September 30, 2024, with other inputs remain equal, if discount rate increases by 1%, the fair value will decrease by NT$590,127 thousand; if discount for lack of marketability increases by 1%, the fair value will decrease by NT$142,378 thousand.

For the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.

3) Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value

Except as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements that are not measured at fair value approximate their fair values.

33.    SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS

Significant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:

a.Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee approved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC’s capacity provided TSMC’s outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of the end of reporting period, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.

b.Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. TSMC’s equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC’s capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as of the end of reporting period.

c.TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies and agreements of waste disposal with multiple suppliers. The relative minimum fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreements.
