INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Financial Statement Audit and Attestation Engagements of Certified Public Accountants and the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.



- 2 -


Key audit matter for the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 is stated as follows:

Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) – commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as equipment under installation and construction in progress (EUI/CIP)

Refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.

Given the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:

1.    We read the Company’s policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.

2.    We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.

3.    We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:

a.    Evaluated whether the selection did not meet the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation.

b.    Observed the assets and evaluated their status.

4.    We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.

5.    We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.

Other Matter

We have also audited the parent company only financial statements of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRS, IAS, IFRIC, and SIC endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as management

- 3 -


determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance (including members of the Audit and Risk Committee) are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1.Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

2.Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

3.Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

4.Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

5.Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.



- 4 -


6.Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partners on the audits resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Shih Tsung Wu and Shang Chih Lin.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022



(Amounts in Thousands of New Taiwan Dollars, Unless Specified Otherwise)



1.    GENERAL

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), a Republic of China (R.O.C.) corporation, was incorporated on February 21, 1987. TSMC is a dedicated foundry in the semiconductor industry which engages mainly in the manufacturing, sales, packaging, testing and computer-aided design of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices and the manufacturing of masks.

On September 5, 1994, TSMC’s shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). On October 8, 1997, TSMC listed some of its shares of stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs).

The address of its registered office and principal place of business is No. 8, Li-Hsin Rd. 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan. The principal operating activities of TSMC’s subsidiaries are described in Note 4.



2.    THE AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 6, 2024.



3.    APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

a.    Initial application of the amendments to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) (collectively, “IFRS Accounting Standards”) endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)

Except for the following, the initial application of the amendments to the IFRS Accounting Standards endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC did not have a material impact on the accounting policies of TSMC and its subsidiaries (collectively as the “Company”):

Amendments to IAS 12 “International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules”

The amendments introduce a temporary exception to the requirements in IAS 12 by stipulating that the Company should neither recognize nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The amendments also require the Company to disclose that it has applied the exception and separately disclose its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two income taxes. In addition, for periods in which Pillar Two legislation is enacted or substantively enacted but not yet in effect, the Company should disclose qualitative and quantitative information that helps users of financial statements understand the Company’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The requirement that the Company applies the exception and the requirement to disclose that fact is applied immediately upon issuance of the amendments in May 2023. The remaining disclosure requirements are applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, but not for any interim period ending on or before December 31, 2023.



- 12 -




b.    The IFRS Accounting Standards issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the FSC with effective date starting 2024










New, Amended and Revised Standards and Interpretations

Effective Date Issued 
by IASB



Amendments to IAS 1 “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current” and “Non-current Liabilities with Covenants”

January 1, 2024

c.    The IFRS Accounting Standards issued by IASB, but not yet endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC










New, Amended and Revised Standards and Interpretations

Effective Date Issued 
by IASB



Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture”

To be determined by IASB

As of the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue, the Company continues in evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance from the initial adoption of the aforementioned standards or interpretations and related applicable period. The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes its evaluation.



4.    SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

For the convenience of readers, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language consolidated financial statements shall prevail.

Statement of Compliance

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRS Accounting Standards endorsed by the FSC with the effective dates (collectively, “Taiwan-IFRS Accounting Standards”).

Basis of Preparation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.

Basis of Consolidation

The basis for the consolidated financial statements

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).

Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.

- 13 -





All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the parent.

When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between:

a.    the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and

b.    the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.

The Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.

The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.

Foreign Currencies

The financial statements of each individual consolidated entity were expressed in the currency which reflected its primary economic environment (functional currency). The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the operating results and financial positions of each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.

In preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.

For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).

Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities

Current assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.



- 15 -




Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.

Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Assets

The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

a.    Category of financial assets and measurement

Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.

1)    Financial asset at FVTPL

For certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.

2)    Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI

Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.

Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.

3)    Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI

On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.



- 16 -




Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity.

Dividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the Company’s rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.

4)    Measured at amortized cost

Cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables, refundable deposits and temporary payments (including those classified under other current assets and other noncurrent assets) are measured at amortized cost.

Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.

Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.

b.    Impairment of financial assets

At the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.

The loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.

The Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.

c.    Derecognition of financial assets

The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.

On derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had

- 17 -




been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.

Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments

Classification as debt or equity

Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.

Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

Hedge Accounting

a.    Fair value hedge

The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.



- 18 -




b.    Cash flow hedge

The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks or interest rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When forecast transactions actually take place, the accumulated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the initial cost of the hedged items, or reclassified to finance costs of hedged items in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

The Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.

c.    Hedges of net investments in foreign operations

The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as bank loans denominated in foreign currency, as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage the exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations due to currency fluctuations. Any gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of foreign currency translation reserve. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

The gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge, which were accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve, are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method

Investments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.

An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.



- 19 -




When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.

The Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company ceases to have significant influence over an associate. When the Company retains an interest in the former associate, the Company measures the retained interest at fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. If the Company’s ownership interest in an associate is reduced as a result of disposal, but the investment continues to be an associate, the Company should reclassify to profit or loss only a proportionate amount of the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income.

When the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company’s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company’s ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.

When a consolidated entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.

Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.

Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.




- 20 -




Leases

For a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

The Company as lessor

Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The Company as lessee

Except for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.

Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Other intangible assets

Other separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method

- 21 -




are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets

At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified locations.

Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.



- 22 -




In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.

Employee Benefits

Short-term employee benefits

Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.

Retirement benefits

For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.

Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.

Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders’ equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Share-based payment arrangements

a.    Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements

Restricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and the Company’s best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned employee benefits.

When restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned employee benefits is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.




- 23 -




b.    Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

Taxation

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.

Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current and deferred tax for the year

Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.



- 24 -




Government Grants

Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets. Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.



5.    MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.

Material Accounting Judgments

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.

Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)

As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.

Judgments on Lease Terms

In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.

Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty

Valuation of Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.

The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.

Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill

In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.

Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.

Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates

In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.

Fair value hedge

The Company entered into interest rate futures contracts, which are used to partially hedge against the fair value changes caused by interest rate fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.

On the basis of economic relationships, the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses, net.

The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risks.

Cash flow hedge

The Company entered into forward contracts to partially hedge foreign exchange rate risks or interest rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.

On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, refer to Note 20(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items and the amount reclassified to finance costs of hedged items.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations

TSMC has designated the bank loans denominated in foreign currency as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage its foreign currency risk arising from investment in overseas subsidiaries.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the material difference between the notional amount of bank loans denominated in foreign currency and the net investment in foreign operations. No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, refer to Note 20 (d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments.

The Company signed a contract with the bank to sell certain accounts receivable without recourse and transaction cost required. These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.

The Company’s goodwill has been tested for impairment at the end of the annual reporting period and the recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use. The value in use was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial budgets covering the future five-year period, and the Company used annual discount rates of 9.0% and 8.7% in its test of impairment as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to reflect the relevant specific risk in the cash-generating unit.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not recognize any impairment loss on goodwill.

19.    RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

a.    Defined contribution plans

The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC Europe, TSMC Japan, TSMC JDC, TSMC 3DIC, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, JASM, TSMC Technology and TSMC Canada also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$5,365,458 thousand and NT$4,550,387 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

b.    Defined benefit plans

TSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.

Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:

The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by qualified actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:

Future salary increase rate

Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:

1) Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.

2) Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.

Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$757,663 thousand and NT$766,692 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

3) Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$735,167 thousand and NT$746,933 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.

The Company expects to make contributions of NT$991,646 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2023. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years.

c.    Retained earnings and dividend policy

TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation.

TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.

The legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.

Pursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside an additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders’ equity, such as the accumulated balance of the foreign currency translation reserve, the effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders’ equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.

31.    CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The objective of the Company’s capital management is to maintain a capital structure that ensures liquidity and supports a solid investment grade credit rating. The capital structure includes both debt and equity. The Company adjusts its capital structure mainly through changes in the level of debt and adjustments of dividend payout to shareholders.

The Company’s capital management policy remained unchanged in 2023. TSMC’s current credit ratings are AA- from Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 from Moody’s, same as those as of December 31, 2022.

b.    Financial risk management objectives

The Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.

The plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.


c.    Market risk

The Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.

Foreign currency risk

Substantially all the Company’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures and equity investments are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts and non-derivative financial instruments, such as currency forwards, currency swaps and bank loans denominated in foreign currency, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, certain forecasted transactions, and net investments in foreign operations. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.

Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$891,039 thousand and NT$1,704,553 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.

Interest rate risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.



- 61 -




The majority of the Company’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI and amortized cost. Those classified as FVTOCI may have their fair value adversely affected due to an increase in interest rates, but for those classified as amortized cost, their carrying amount will not be affected by changes in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents may generate less interest income than expected. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.

Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company’s other comprehensive income by NT$3,841,994 thousand and NT$3,831,326 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The majority of the Company’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.

Other price risk

The Company is exposed to mutual funds and equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTPL and FVTOCI.

Assuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the mutual funds and equity investments at the end of the reporting period, the net income would have decreased by NT$1,073,397 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$954,925 thousand and NT$631,530 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.


d.    Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.

Business related credit risk

The Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 91% and 82% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.

Financial credit risk

The Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.

The objective of the Company’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be

- 62 -




investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested securities since initial recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material information of the issuers.

The Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the probability of default and loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies. The current credit risk assessment policies are as follows:

-

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the expected credit loss increased NT$35,751 thousand and NT$57,936 thousand, respectively. The changes were mainly due to increased investment amount and adjusted investment portfolio.


e.    Liquidity risk management

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTOCI-current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.

f.    Fair value of financial instruments

1)    Fair value measurements recognized in the consolidated balance sheets

Fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

•Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- 64 -




•Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

•Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The timing of transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy is at the end of reporting period.

•The fair values of corporate bonds, agency bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and government bonds are determined by quoted market prices provided by third party pricing services.

•The fair values of forward contracts are measured using forward rates and discount rates derived from quoted market prices.

•The fair value of accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI is determined by the present value of future cash flows based on the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.

Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 3 fair value measurement

The fair values of mutual funds and non-publicly traded equity investments (excluding those trading on the Emerging Stock Board) are mainly determined by using the asset approach and market approach.

The asset approach takes into account the net asset value measured at the fair value by independent parties. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$52,704 thousand and NT48,704 thousand, respectively, if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.

For the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.

In addition, the fair values of convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds are prior transaction prices.

3)    Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value

Except as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements that are not measured at fair value approximate their fair values.

35.    SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS

Significant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:

a.Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee approved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC’s capacity provided TSMC’s outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of the end of reporting period, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.

b.Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. TSMC’s equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC’s capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as of the end of reporting period.

c.In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC (“Daedalus”) filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC North America, and other companies infringe four U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation in October 2022. In June 2023, Daedalus dropped two of the asserted patents in the ITC. Also in June 2023, Daedalus filed another complaint in the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC infringes five U.S. patents. In September 2023, the ITC granted the parties’ joint motion to suspend the procedural schedule while the parties finalize the settlement agreement and then request termination of the ITC Investigation and related litigations. In October 2023, the parties jointly requested the ITC to terminate the investigation and Eastern District of Texas to dismiss the related litigations. In November 2023, the ITC investigation was terminated and the related litigations in the Eastern District of Texas were dismissed.

d.TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies and agreements of waste disposal with multiple suppliers. The relative minimum fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreements.

e.TSMC entered into a long-term purchase agreement of equipment. The relative fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreement.

f.TSMC entered into long-term energy purchase agreements with multiple suppliers. The relative fulfillment period, quantity and price are specified in the agreements.

g.Amounts available under unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were NT$433,994 thousand and NT$383,974 thousand, respectively.

h.The Company entrusted financial institutions to provide performance guarantees mainly for import and export of goods, lease agreement and energy purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aforementioned guarantee amounted to NT$8,012,973 thousand and NT$7,623,262 thousand, respectively.
