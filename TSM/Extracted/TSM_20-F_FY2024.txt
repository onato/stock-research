Risk Factors
We wish to caution readers that the following important factors, and those important factors described in other reports submitted to, or filed with, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“U.S. SEC”), among other factors, could affect our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, and that such factors may adversely affect our business and financial status and therefore the value of your investment.
Risks Relating to Our Business
Any global systemic political, economic and financial crisis (as well as the indirect effects flowing therefrom) could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In recent times, several major systemic political, economic and financial crises negatively affected global business, banking and financial sectors, including the semiconductor industry and markets.
Since 2018, there have been political and trade tensions among a number of the world’s major economies. These tensions have resulted or may result in the implementation of tariff, non-tariff trade barriers, sanctions, export controls and other measures that have been particularly impactful to the semiconductor industry and related markets. Prolonged or increased use of such measures may negatively impact the growth of the global economy and the semiconductor industry, resulting in declines in electronic products sales from which we generate our income through our products and services. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on April 2, 2025 a 10% baseline tariff on imports into the United States from all countries, as well as varying reciprocal tariffs on certain trading partners, including Taiwan. The varying reciprocal tariffs, except those on Chinese goods, were then paused until July 9, 2025; imports subject to variable reciprocal tariffs will instead be subject to the baseline 10% tariff during the period. Semiconductors were not subject to the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, 2025. However, given ongoing discussions between the United States and its trading partners, there remains significant uncertainty about whether the United States may further change the scope and level of tariffs it imposes, including any potential tariffs it may impose on semiconductor imports. Any tariffs imposed on imports of semiconductors and products incorporating chips into the United States may result in increased costs for purchasing such products, which may, in turn, lead to decreased demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and future growth. Also, any increase in the use of export control restrictions and sanctions to target certain countries and entities, any expansion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of such measures, or complete or partial ban on semiconductor products sales to certain entities could impact not only our ability to continue supplying products to those customers, but also our customers’ demand for our products, and could even lead to changes in semiconductor supply chains. For example, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”) in 2020. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 2020. In October 2022 and October 2023, the U.S. adopted additional export controls (the “October Rules”) over specified countries (including China) under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“U.S. EAR”) on certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The controls impose license requirements for items subject to the U.S. EAR where the items are destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as for U.S. persons’ activities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing items. In response, we obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce a Validated End-User (the “VEU”) authorization for our fab located in Nanjing, China, which is a permanent authorization that allows our fab in Nanjing to receive exports of eligible items from the U.S. without separate licenses. However, there is no assurance that the VEU authorization we obtained will not be terminated in the future. The restrictions imposed by the October Rules on exports of advanced computing ICs are further reinforced by the U.S.’ new rules issued in January 2025. Under the new rules, we may need to obtain an export license prior to shipping products using 16-nanometer or below process to any global destination unless specific conditions are met. As a result, shipments of certain products may be delayed or prohibited due to the license requirements and our financial results may be adversely affected.

On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies. As of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected by the expanded export control regulations or the novel rules or measures adopted to counteract them. Nevertheless, depending on future developments in global trade tensions and military conflicts, such regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result. Please see “Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations material to our operations, such as export control, environmental and climate related laws and regulations, or the inability to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for the conduct of our business, such as fab land and construction approvals, could harm our business and operational results or subject us to potential significant legal liability” for a further discussion.
Any future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation or changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically. If the economic conditions or financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate, the demand for our products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating income and net income. In addition, sufficient external financing may not be available to us on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to us, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when we need such financing to meet our capital requirements, we may be forced to curtail our expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until we obtain such financing. In conclusion, any of these events, including any future global systemic crisis or further escalation of trade tensions as described above, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
Our global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with political, economic, financial, military or other conditions or developments in various jurisdictions, including in particular the R.O.C., as well as in international trade, which could negatively affect our business and financial status and therefore the market value of your investment.
The majority of our principal executive officers and our principal production facilities are located in the R.O.C., and the majority of our net revenue is derived from our operations in the R.O.C. In addition, we have operations worldwide and a significant percentage of our revenue comes from sales to locations outside the R.O.C. Operating in the R.O.C. and overseas exposes us to changes in laws, rules, regulations and the enforcements of such laws, rules and regulations in certain key areas that could have a material impact on our operations, such as intellectual property, labor, antitrust, export control, import restrictions, and trade barriers or disputes. In addition, deterioration in general political, economic, financial or social conditions, military conflicts, the risk of outbreak of war or hostilities, terrorism events, security risks, social unrest, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate or elsewhere, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our ADSs and common shares. Furthermore, any major change in economic, fiscal and/or trade policies in the U.S. from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue or in another major jurisdiction could severely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, recent political and trade tensions among major economies as well as military conflicts (such as the conflict in Ukraine since early 2022) have resulted in the imposition of trade barriers, such as sanctions and import and export controls, which could increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies, make our pricing less competitive, and limit our ability to offer our products and services in some markets or source key materials and key production equipment, which may have adverse direct or indirect effects on our sales.
Any law or government policy that encourages our customers to relocate their manufacturing capacity or supply chain to their own countries or require their respective contractors, subcontractors and relevant agents to do so could also impair our ability to sustain our current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency. An important aspect of our business operation is an ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C. that provides us with significant operational synergies, flexibility and efficiencies. For example, we are able to temporarily reassign thousands of our engineers and other relevant personnel from one manufacturing site to another to refine specific designs and adapt manufacturing processes in a timely manner. These advantages permit us to operate our manufacturing fabs efficiently and resolve any technical or commercial difficulties quickly to maintain our competitive edge. Restrictions on our ability to transfer people among our operations in the R.O.C., the United States, the P.R.C., Japan, and Europe efficiently due to challenges such as regional employment rules and regulations, and immigration or travel restrictions, may impair or reduce these advantages, and we may not be able to sustain our current ability to supply our customers with goods and services at the current level of cost, quality, quantity and delivery schedule to which our customers have been accustomed.

In addition, the financial markets have viewed certain past developments in relations between the R.O.C. and the P.R.C. as occasions to depress general market prices of the securities of R.O.C. companies, including our own. Also, the R.O.C. government has not lifted some trade and investment restrictions imposed on R.O.C. companies on the amount and types of certain investments that can be made in the P.R.C. Our plans, investment applications and/or any relevant regulatory approvals to establish or possibly expand operations in the P.R.C. may be delayed, interrupted, suspended or cancelled due to unforeseeable social and political factors in the R.O.C. or the P.R.C., and these potential operational risks can be aggravated by applicable export controls which impose license requirements on our P.R.C. fab’s acquisition of certain manufacturing tools.
If we are unable to successfully manage the complexity of our global operations and deal with the challenges and risks related to our global expansion, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We have multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Global expansion has required and will continue to require considerable managerial, financial and other resources. We expect to face particular challenges in global expansion and operations, including but not limited to:
 
 
•
 
higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas locations, the impact on our ability to sustain our current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by our ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas locations;
 
 
•
 
labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially delay the completion of our expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet our capacity expansion plans;
 
 
•
 
disruptions to our operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage or spill, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, labor issues, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and disruptions in utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc.;
 
 
•
 
scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit our future expansion of operations;
 
 
•
 
compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if our practices are deemed not to be in compliance;
 
 
•
 
challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our information technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks worldwide;
 
 
•
 
adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives, including non-receipt, delay and potential claw backs of government subsidies;
 
 
•
 
challenges in creating an inclusive workplace in new sites to embrace the cultural differences and managing the operation over large geographic distances and in context of different employment practices and labor laws and regulations;
 
 
•
 
limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our rights to intellectual property; and
 
 
•
 
exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.
If we are unable to overcome the above challenges, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Decreases in demand and average selling prices for products that contain semiconductors may adversely affect demand for our products and may result in a decrease in our revenue and earnings.
A vast majority of our revenue is derived from customers who use our products in HPC (including AI applications), smartphones, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including our products and services, could adversely affect our revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because we own most of our manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices (“ASP”) of end-use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end-use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by us, which, in turn, may negatively impact our revenue, margin and earnings.

Since we are dependent on the highly cyclical semiconductor and electronics industries, which have experienced significant and sometimes prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity, our revenue, margins and earnings may fluctuate significantly.
The electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which could impact our semiconductor foundry business. Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in our revenue and earnings. From time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because we are, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for our services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including our services. If we are not able to take appropriate actions, such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, our revenue, margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.
If we are unable to remain a technological leader in the semiconductor industry, unable to timely respond to fast-changing semiconductor market dynamics, or unable to maintain our edge in product quality, we may become less competitive.
The semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of AI has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in our industry; thus, our ability to continuously develop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs and changes in the AI industry will be critical for us to effectively compete in this space. We also believe that the effective use of AI in our internal operations is important to our long-term success. As the AI technologies are rapidly evolving, if we are unable to deploy new AI technologies in our internal operations as effectively as our competitors, it may hurt our competitive position. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If we are unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, we risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If we are unable to overcome the above factors, we may become less competitive and our revenue may decline significantly.
In light of the rise of new foundry service providers worldwide, if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive foundry segment of the semiconductor industry, including through equal access to governmental financial incentives, especially those available to our competitors, we may lose customers and/or our profit margin and earnings may decrease.
The competition in the semiconductor foundry segment is fierce. We compete with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced or different technologies than us. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than us, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to us. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea and Japan provide various incentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the “U.S. CHIPS Act”), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S. semiconductor industry. In November 2024, TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC Arizona”) entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the receipt of certain incentives pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, which includes up to US$6.6 billion in total direct funding and up to US$5 billion of proposed loans. Please see “Item 4. Information on The Company – Our Subsidiaries and Affiliates.” In December 2024, ESMC, our subsidiary in Germany, entered into an agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany for the receipt of up to EUR5 billion state aid under the European Chips Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781). Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where we are currently expanding or planning to expand our production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to us, there is no assurance that we will be able to receive such financial incentives, including pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, at the levels we anticipate or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives we receive may be subject to conditions and requirements imposed by the grantors, such as restrictions on the expansion of facilities in foreign countries of concern and on joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern on any technology or product that raises national security concerns. Noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the grants that we may receive could result in a delay or forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as obligate us to repay all or a portion of amounts already received pursuant to the grants. Even if we satisfy the conditions and requirements for the funding disbursement, it is possible that the grantor may delay the disbursement or be unable to provide the funding. While we expect to continue benefiting from government incentives, failure to obtain grants that we seek, to fully utilize available grants, or to comply with the terms and conditions of grants could impact our ability to achieve our goals for the projects that would otherwise benefit from grant funding and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Moreover, our competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. Our competitors may also compete for our customers who seek to diversify their supply chains. These competitive activities may decrease our customer base, our pricing, or both. If we are unable to compete effectively with such competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality, supply chain diversification and resilience, and customer satisfaction, we risk losing customers or business to such contenders.
If we are unable to manage our capacity and production facilities effectively, our competitiveness may be weakened.
We perform long-term market demand forecasts on a regular basis for our products and services to manage our overall capacity. Based on market demand, we have continued to add capacity to meet market needs for our products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Kumamoto, Japan and in Dresden, Germany.
Implementing these capacity expansion plans will increase our costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, we would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If we do not increase our net revenue accordingly, our financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs. See “Item 4. Information on The Company – Capacity Management and Technology Upgrade Plans” for a further discussion.
In addition, market conditions are dynamic, and our market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of our manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, we may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, our financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.
Having one or more large customers that account for a significant percentage of our revenue may render us vulnerable to the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by such customers that could in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, the increasing consolidation of our customers may further increase our revenue concentration.
Over the years, our customer profile and the nature of our customers’ business have changed dramatically. While we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, our ten largest customers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for approximately, 68%, 70% and 76% of our net revenue in the respective year. Our largest customer in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for 23%, 25% and 22% of our net revenue in the respective year. Our second largest customer in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for less than 10%, 11%, and 12% of our net revenue in the respective year. A more concentrated customer base will subject our revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from our large customers and cause different seasonal patterns in our business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and HPC devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.
There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, we have seen changes in the nature of our customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend among system companies designing their own semiconductors and working directly with the semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market. These shifting business models could lead to significant variations in our sales if the growth of their products and services, particularly in the AI sector, is volatile or not sustainable.
Also, since the global semiconductor industry has become increasingly competitive, some of our customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of our major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of our customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at our major customers, could impact our ability to supply products to those customers or reduce those customers’ demand for our products and services and thus impact their business operations.

The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in our major customers’ business models, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
If our information technology systems or those of our service providers with whom we share our confidential information succumb to cyberattacks by third parties worldwide, our business and operations may be severely interrupted or even shut down, and our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.
Even though we have established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, we cannot guarantee that our computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as our manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, our systems may lose important corporate data or our production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of our customers and other stakeholders and personal information of our employees. While we seek to continuously review and assess our cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious codes and sophisticated phishing attempts.
Malicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into our network systems to disrupt our operations, blackmail us to regain control of our computing systems, or spy on us for sensitive information. These attacks may result in us having to pay damages for our delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance our cybersecurity network, and may also expose us to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.
In the past, we experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software. We have implemented and continually update rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. See “Item 16K. Cybersecurity” for a further discussion. While these ongoing enhancements further improve our cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that we are immune to cyberattacks.
In addition, we employ certain third-party service providers for us and our affiliates worldwide with whom we need to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While we require such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in our service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If we or our service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of our data (and data belonging to our customers and other third parties) or maintain control of our or our service providers’ computing systems, our commitments to our customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.
We may not be able to implement our planned growth and development or maintain our leading position if we are unable to recruit and retain key executives, managers and skilled technical and service personnel.
We rely on the continued services and contributions of our management team, as well as skilled technical and professional personnel. Our business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent shortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for our products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, we cannot ensure timely fulfillment of our personnel demand.
We may be unable to obtain in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost equipment that is necessary for us to remain competitive.
Our operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on our ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers. As a result, we may encounter the situation of limited supply and/or long delivery cycles. To better manage our supply chain, we evaluate and project delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. We have also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. To enhance our sourcing capabilities for our global sites, we have also taken steps to strengthen our understanding of local regulations, policies, and supply chains. However, if we are unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts we need, we may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If we are unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill our customers’ demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to do so at a reasonable cost, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Our revenue and profitability may decline if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner and at commercially reasonable prices.
Our production operations require that we obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation, occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since we procure some of our raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that our need for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also restrict our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. Our revenue and earnings could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials.
Any inability to obtain, preserve, enforce, defend and protect our technologies, intellectual property rights and third-party licenses could harm our competitive position.
Our ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. While we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, we cannot assure you that, as our business or business models expand into new areas, we will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.
We have received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that our technologies, our manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by us or the use of those semiconductors by our customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, our market position, and the expansion of our manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, we may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase our cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by us. See “Item 8. Financial Information – Legal Proceedings” for a further discussion. Also, with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, we have faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.
If we fail to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fail to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (i) prevent us from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (ii) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenue.

Our operational results could also be materially and adversely affected by disruptive events or industrial accidents, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate.
Disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage or spill, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, sabotage, terrorism, failure of critical facilities and equipment, disruptions in utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc., could interrupt our operations. Most of our production facilities, as well as those of many of our suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity and/or water, which could cause interruptions to our operations. In April 2024 and January 2025, several earthquakes struck Taiwan, causing damage to our inventories, plant facilities, machinery and equipment. We recognized approximately NT$3 billion and NT$5.3 billion in losses from earthquakes, net of insurance claim, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.
If one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, or if any of our fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce our manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers, and thereby have an adverse, material impact on our operational and financial performance.
Our operations may be interrupted, and our expansion may be limited, by power or other utility outages or shortages, and our financial results may be adversely affected by increased prices of power or other utilities.
We have occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by our electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If we are unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity for our manufacturing fabs, our ability to fill customers’ orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, we have encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we became subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which increased by 25% as compared to the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. In October 2024, the electricity tariff rate further increased by 14%. The hike in electricity prices could increase our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results.
In addition, due to climate change, severe weather events, such as droughts, and any measures taken by governments in response to such severe weather events may materially affect our operations and our suppliers’ production. For example, the measures taken by governments in response to droughts, including water rationing and conservation, may cause interruption to our operations or our expansion plans.
If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, our operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.
Adverse fluctuations in exchange rates could decrease our operating margin and/or revenue.
Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every 1% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in our operating margin based on our 2024 results.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of our customers and for our goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect our revenue. Please see “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for a further discussion.
Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations material to our operations, such as export control, environmental and climate related laws and regulations, or the inability to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for the conduct of our business, such as fab land and construction approvals, could harm our business and operational results or subject us to potential significant legal liability.
Because we engage in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conduct business with our customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of our products require the use of equipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide. Our failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, and our failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:

Our role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits our visibility and information available to us regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by us. This constraint impedes our ability to fully ensure that semiconductors manufactured by us will not be diverted to unintended end use or end-user, including potentially by our business partners, or by third parties with an intent of circumvention. In addition, if we or our business partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits or are found to have violated applicable export control or sanctions laws, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties resulting from relevant legal proceedings, as described in the above paragraph. In October 2024, we notified relevant U.S. and Taiwan authorities that one type of our customer’s chip manufactured by us might have been diverted to a restricted entity or incorporated into a restricted entity’s product, and since then have been cooperating with the authorities’ requests for additional information and documents. Despite our best efforts to comply with all relevant export control and sanctions laws and regulations, there is no assurance that our business activities will not be found incompliant with export control laws and regulations.
Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require us, among other things, to do the following: (a) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (b) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs and air pollution reduction plans; (c) modify our product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as paying any incurred carbon fees if our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for our operations.
Our inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of our business could impair our operational and financial results. For example, if we are unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of our expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect our business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, our operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed in response to public concern and social environmental pressures even if we comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
For further details, please see our compliance record with Taiwan and international environmental and climate related laws and regulations as well as our business continuity management of climate change policy in “Item 4. Information on The Company – Environmental and Climate Related Laws and Regulations”.
Any adverse results of potential antitrust proceedings that we may be subject to could harm our business and operational results or subject us to potential significant legal liability.
We are subject to antitrust laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, and from time to time receive related inquiries from enforcement agencies. With our success in the foundry business and the increasing criticism on the concentration of the semiconductor industry and sometimes directly on us, we are subject to heightened risks of antitrust investigations. In September 2017, we were contacted by the European Commission, which asked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales. We cooperated with the European Commission to provide the requested information and documents. The European Commission subsequently decided to close the investigation in May 2020. Any adverse results of potential antitrust proceedings could harm our business and distract our management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or prospects, and subject us to potential significant legal liability.

Any impairment charges may have a material adverse effect on our net income.
Under IFRSs, we are required to evaluate our tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge. We are not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on our net income.
The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are otherwise already depressed. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Reviews and Prospects – Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty” for a discussion of how we assess if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.
Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and corruption, our reputation and results of operations could be harmed.
We are required to comply with various R.O.C. and U.S. laws and regulations on internal controls, but internal controls may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, fraud or corruption.
Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and ADSs.
Any amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the R.O.C., the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate our business may have an adverse effect on our net income.
While we are subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct business, our principal operations are in the R.O.C. and we are exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our operating results. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on our operating results. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Reviews and Prospects – Taxation” for further discussion of significant tax regulation changes.
Risks Relating to Ownership of ADSs
Your voting rights as a holder of ADSs will be limited.
Holders of American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) evidencing ADSs may exercise voting rights with respect to the common shares represented by these ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of our ADS deposit agreement. The deposit agreement provides that, upon receipt of notice of any meeting of holders of our common shares, the depositary bank will, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the holders (i) the notice of the meeting sent by us, (ii) voting instruction forms and (iii) a statement as to the manner in which instructions may be given by the holders.
ADS holders will not generally be able to exercise the voting rights attaching to the deposited securities on an individual basis. According to the provisions of our ADS deposit agreement, the voting rights attaching to the deposited securities must be exercised as to all matters subject to a vote of shareholders collectively in the same manner, except in the case of an election of directors. Election of directors is by means of cumulative voting. See “Item 10. Additional Information – Voting of Deposited Securities” for a more detailed discussion of the manner in which a holder of ADSs can exercise its voting rights.

You may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings.
We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under our ADS deposit agreement, the depositary bank will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”), with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. Although we may be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions for rights offerings by certain foreign companies, we can give no assurance that we can establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have such a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result.
If the depositary bank is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights.
The value of your investment may be reduced by possible future sales of common shares or ADSs by us or our shareholders or fluctuations in foreign exchange.
One or more of our existing shareholders may, from time to time, dispose of significant numbers of our common shares or ADSs. For example, the National Development Fund of the R.O.C., which owned 6.38% of TSMC’s outstanding shares as of February 28, 2025, had from time to time in the past sold our shares in the form of ADSs in several transactions.
We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of ADSs or common shares, or the availability of ADSs or common shares for future sales, will have on the market price of ADSs or common shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of ADSs or common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the prevailing market price of our ADSs or common shares. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of our common shares and the market price of the ADSs and the U.S. dollar value of any cash dividends paid in NT dollars on our common shares represented by ADSs.
The market value of our shares may fluctuate due to the volatility of, and government intervention in, the R.O.C. securities market.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange has experienced from time to time substantial fluctuations in the prices and volumes of sales of listed securities. There are currently limits on the range of daily price movements on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In response to past declines and volatility in the securities markets in Taiwan, and in line with similar activities by other countries in Asia, the government of the R.O.C. formed the Stabilization Fund, which had purchased and may from time to time purchase shares of Taiwan companies to support these markets. In addition, other funds associated with the R.O.C. government had in the past purchased, and may from time to time purchase, shares of Taiwan companies on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or other markets. These funds had disposed and may from time to time dispose shares of Taiwan companies so purchased at a later time. In the future, market activity by government entities, or the perception that such activity is taking place, may take place or cease, may cause fluctuations in the market prices of our ADSs and common shares.

In 2024, our net revenue increased by a total of NT$732,572 million compared to 2023, which was mainly due to an increase in orders from North America of NT$561,111 million, or a 38% year-over-year increase and from Asia Pacific of NT$109,361 million, or a 63% year-over-year increase. In 2023, our net revenue decreased by a total of NT$102,155 million compared to 2022, which was mainly due to a decrease in orders from Asia Pacific of NT$66,267 million, or a 27% year-over-year decrease and from North America of NT$64,427 million, or a 4% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in orders from China of NT$21,985 million, or a 9% year-over-year increase.
We provide worldwide customer support. Our office in Hsinchu and subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea are dedicated to serving our customers worldwide. Foundry services, which are both technologically and logistically intensive, involve frequent and in-depth interaction with customers. We believe that the most effective means of providing foundry services is by developing direct and close relationships with our customers. Our customer service and technical support managers work closely with the sales force to offer integrated services to customers. To facilitate customer interaction and information access on a real-time basis, a suite of web-based applications have also been offered to provide more active interactions with customers in design, engineering and logistics.
Advance Payment by Customers. Because of the fast-changing technology and functionality in semiconductor design, foundry customers generally do not place purchase orders far in advance to manufacture a particular type of product. However, some of our customers have entered into agreements with us to pay temporary receipts in order to retain specified capacity at our fabs. The treatment of advance temporary receipts, either by refund or by accounts receivable offsetting, will be determined by mutual consent when the terms and conditions set forth in the agreements are satisfied. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
The Semiconductor Fabrication Process
In general, the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with a thin silicon wafer on which an array of semiconductor devices is fabricated. The following processes cover assembly, packaging, and testing of the semiconductor devices. Our focus is on wafer fabrication although we also provide other services either directly or through outsourcing arrangements.
Our Foundry Services
Range of Services. Because of our ability to provide a full array of services, we are able to accommodate customers with a variety of needs at every stage of the overall foundry process. The flexibility in input stages allows us to cater to a variety of customers with different in-house capabilities and thus to service a wider class of customers as compared to a foundry that cannot offer design or mask making services, for example. As we serve a large global customer base that entails a wide range of applications, such customer diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand.
Fabrication Processes. We manufacture semiconductors mainly using the CMOS process. The CMOS process is currently the mainstream semiconductor manufacturing process. We use the CMOS process to manufacture logic semiconductors, mixed-signal/radio frequency semiconductors, which combine analog and digital circuitry in a single semiconductor, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (“MEMS”), which combines micrometer featured mechanical parts, analog and digital circuitry in a single semiconductor, and embedded memory semiconductors, which combine logic and memory in a single semiconductor, etc.

Types of Semiconductors We Manufacture. We manufacture different types of semiconductors with different specific functions by changing the number and the combinations of conducting, insulating and semiconducting layers and by defining different patterns in which such layers are applied on the wafer. At any given point in time, there are thousands of different products in various stages of fabrication at our fabs. We believe that the keys to maintaining high production quality and utilization rates are our effective management and control of the manufacturing process technologies which comes from our extensive experience as the longest existing dedicated foundry and our dedication to quality control and process improvements.

The decrease in our net revenue from 2022 to 2023 mainly came from Smartphone of NT$73,965 million, or an 8% year-over-year decrease, and from Internet of Things of NT$34,198 million, or a 17% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was partially offset by an increase from Automotive of NT$17,273 million, or a 15% year-over-year increase.
Design and Technology Platforms. Modern integrated circuit designers need sophisticated design infrastructure to optimize productivity and cycle time. Such infrastructure includes design flow for electronic design automation (“EDA”), silicon proven building blocks such as libraries and intellectual properties, simulation and verification design kits such as PDK and technology files. All of this infrastructure is built on top of the technology foundation, and each technology needs its own design infrastructure to be usable for designers. This is the concept of our technology platforms.
For years, we and our alliance partners have spent considerable effort, time and resources to build our technology platforms. We unveiled an Open Innovation Platform® (“OIP”) initiative in 2008 to further enhance our technologies offerings. More OIP deliverables were introduced over the years, as well as in 2024. In the design methodology area, we announced EDA and intellectual property readiness of 2-nanometer and 3-nanometer, as well as continuous development of solutions to enhance power, performance and area (“PPA”) on existing production technology nodes. In addition, we also announced the openness of 3Dblox Standard to the semiconductor industry, as well as the availability of various 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit (“3DIC”) reference flows to support TSMC 3DFabric® technologies in 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging which cover a wide range of system-level design applications.

Multi-project Wafer Program (“CyberShuttle®”). To help our customers reduce costs, we offer a dedicated multi-project wafer processing service that allows us to provide multiple customers with circuits produced with the same mask. This program reduces mask costs by a very significant amount, resulting in accelerated time-to-market for our customers. We have extended this program to all of our customers and library and intellectual property partners using our broad selection of process technologies, ranging from the latest 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 12-, 16-, 22-, 28-, 40-, 45-, 55-, 65- and 90-nanometer processes to 0.13-, 0.18-, 0.25-, 0.35- and 0.5-micron. This extension offers a routinely scheduled multi-project wafer run to customers on a shared-cost basis for prototyping and verification.
We developed our multi-project wafer program in response to the current SoC development methodologies, which often require the independent development, prototyping and validation of several intellectual properties before they can be integrated onto a single device. By sharing mask costs among our customers to the extent permissible, the SoC supplier can enjoy reduced prototyping costs and greater confidence that the design will be successful.
Customer Service
We believe that our dedication to customer service has been an indispensable factor in attracting new customers, helping to ensure the satisfaction of existing customers, and building a mutually beneficial relationship with our customers. The key elements are our:
 
 
•
 
customer-oriented culture through multi-level interaction with customers;
 
 
•
 
ability to deliver products of consistent quality, competitive ramp-up speed and fast yield improvement;
 
 
•
 
responsiveness to customers’ issues and requirements, such as engineering change and special wafer handling requests;
 
 
•
 
flexibility in manufacturing processes, supported by our competitive technical capability and production planning;

dedication to help reduce customer costs through collaboration and services, such as our multi-project wafer program, which combines multiple designs on a single mask set for cost-saving; and
 
 
•
 
availability of our online service which provides necessary information in design, engineering and logistics to ensure seamless services to our customers throughout the product life cycle.
We also conduct an annual customer satisfaction survey to assess customer satisfaction and to ensure that their needs are adequately understood and addressed. Continuous improvement plans based upon customer feedback are an integral part of this business process. We use data derived from the survey as a base to identify future focus areas. We believe that satisfaction leads to better customer relationships, which would result in more business opportunities.
Research and Development
The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequently leading to the introduction of new technologies to meet customer demand and the obsolescence of recently introduced technology and products. We believe that to remain technologically ahead of our competitors and maintain our market position in the foundry segment, we need to be a technology leader in the semiconductor industry. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, we spent NT$163,262 million, NT$182,370 million, and NT$204,182 million (US$6,227 million), respectively, on research and development, representing 7.2%, 8.5% and 7.1% of our net revenue, respectively. We plan to continue significant investment in research and development in 2025 to maintain our leadership in advanced process technologies. Our research and development efforts have enabled us to offer customers access to advanced process technologies, such as 7-, 5- and 3-nanometer technology for volume production, prior to the implementation of those advanced process technologies by competitors and many integrated device manufacturers. We expect to further advance our process technologies to 2-nanometer and below in the coming years to sustain our technology leadership. We will also invest in research and development for our mature technology offerings to provide function-rich process capabilities to our customers. Our research and development activities are divided into centralized and fab-conducted research and development activities. Centralized research and development activities focus on developing new logic, SoC, derivatives, package/system-in-package (“SIP”) technologies, along with cost-effective 3D wafer level system integration solutions, including InFO, CoWoS®, and TSMC-SoIC® technologies. Fab-conducted research and development activities focus on improving and upgrading the manufacturing process technologies.

Table of Contents
To advance our process technologies, we rely primarily on our internal engineering capabilities, know-how and research and development efforts, including collaboration with our customers, equipment vendors and external research and development consortia.
We continually create inventions and in-house know-how. Since our inception, we have applied for and been issued a substantial number of patents in the United States and other countries, the majority of which are semiconductor related.
Competition
We compete internationally and domestically with other foundry service providers, as well as with a number of integrated device manufacturers. We compete primarily on process technologies, manufacturing excellence, customer trust and service quality, such as earlier technology readiness, better quality, faster yield improvement and shorter cycle time. The level of competition varies with the process technologies involved. For example, in more mature technologies, competitors tend to be numerous and offer specialized processes. Some companies compete with us in selected geographic regions or niche application markets. In recent years, substantial investments have been made by others to establish new foundry capacities worldwide, or to transform certain manufacturing operations of integrated device manufacturers into foundry capacities.
Equipment
The quality and technology of the equipment used in the semiconductor manufacturing process are important in that they effectively define the limits of our process technologies. Advances in process technologies cannot be brought about without commensurate advances in equipment technology. We have periodic meetings with suppliers with respect to co-developing next-generation equipment.
The principal pieces of equipment used by us to manufacture semiconductors are scanners, cleaners and track equipment, inspection equipment, etchers, furnaces, wet stations, strippers, implanters, sputterers, chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) equipment, chemical mechanism polish (“CMP”) equipment, testers and probers. Other than certain equipment under leases located at testing areas, we own all of the equipment used at our fabs.
In implementing our capacity management and technology advancement plans, we expect to make significant purchases of equipment required for semiconductor manufacturing. Some of the equipment is available from a limited number of suppliers and/or is manufactured in relatively limited quantities, and certain equipment has only recently been developed. We believe that well management of the relationships with our equipment suppliers is important for us as a major purchaser of semiconductor fabrication equipment. We work closely with manufacturers that provide equipment customized to our needs for certain advanced technologies.
Raw Materials
Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, primarily silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and various types of precious metals. Although most of our raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, some materials are purchased through sole-sourced suppliers. Our raw material procurement policy is to select only those suppliers who have demonstrated quality control and reliability on delivery time and to maintain multiple sources for each raw material whenever possible so that a quality or delivery problem with any one supplier will not adversely affect our operations. The quality and delivery performance of each supplier is evaluated quarterly and quantity allocations are adjusted for subsequent periods based on the evaluation.
The most important raw material used in our production is silicon wafer, which is the basic raw material from which integrated circuits are made. In pursuit of high quality raw wafers, the majority of our raw wafers are supplied by a limited number of suppliers located in Taiwan, Japan, Germany, and Singapore. We have in the past obtained, and believe we will continue to be able to obtain, a sufficient supply of wafers. In order to secure a reliable and flexible supply of high quality wafers, we have entered into long-term agreements and intend to continue to develop strategic relationships with major wafer suppliers to cover our anticipated wafer needs for future years. Also, we actively address supply chain issues and bring together fab operations, materials management, quality system and risk management teams to mitigate potential supply chain risks and enhance supply chain agility. This taskforce works with our primary suppliers to review their business continuity plans, qualify their dual-plant materials, prepare safety inventories, improve the quality of their products, and manage the supply chain risks of their suppliers. Please see “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business” for a discussion of the risk related to raw materials, including the fluctuation of prices of our main raw materials.

Environmental and Climate Related Laws and Regulations
The semiconductor production process generates gaseous chemical wastes, greenhouse gases (“GHG”), liquid wastes, wastewater and other industrial wastes in various stages of the manufacturing process. We have installed in our fabs various types of pollution control equipment for the treatment of gaseous and liquid chemical wastes and wastewater, equipment for GHG emission reduction and equipment for the recycling of used chemicals and treated water. Operations at our fabs are subject to regulations and periodic monitoring by the R.O.C. Ministry of Environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the State Environmental Protection Administration of China, the Japan Ministry of the Environment, the European Environment Agency and European Chemicals Agency, and local environmental protection authorities in Taiwan, the U.S., China, Japan and Germany.
We have adopted pollution control and GHG emission reduction measures to ensure compliance with environmental protection and climate related standards consistent with the practice of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan, the U.S., China, Japan and Europe. We conduct environmental audits at least once annually to ensure that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and climate related laws and regulations. An environmental, safety and health (“ESH”) team operates at the corporate level that is responsible for policy establishment and enforcement, coordination with ESH teams located at each manufacturing facility and for coordination and interaction with government agencies worldwide.
To fulfill our commitment to environmental sustainability in our business and operations, we have continued to explore and participate in initiatives to expand our use of renewable energy. In 2024, TSMC used in total 3,610 GWh in renewable energy, renewable energy certificates, and carbon credits globally, of which approximately 2,160 GWh enabled our overseas sites to be 100% powered by clean energy for the seventh consecutive year. As of the end of 2024, we have signed power purchase agreements to purchase 4.4 GW of renewable energy, thereby eliminating an estimated 5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
A comprehensive sustainable governance mechanism is the cornerstone for TSMC to build enduring competitiveness. We oversee our sustainable development efforts through the Board of Directors/Nominating, Corporate Governance, and Sustainability Committee and provide quarterly updates on the progress of ESG initiatives. In addition, we have two key management platforms: the ESG Steering Committee and the ESG Committee. The ESG Steering Committee, led by the Company Chairman, works with the management team to establish development strategies for ESG issues relevant to the Company’s operations and conducts quarterly reviews. The ESG Committee carries out resolutions from the ESG Steering Committee, pools resources across departments, and instructs a dedicated ESG Department to work alongside representatives from various organizations to identify material issues, formulate action plans, and track their progress on a quarterly basis.
We currently focus our ESG efforts on the following key areas:
Drive green manufacturing. We aim to become a leading company in environmental protection by incorporating green management into our daily operations. Utilizing innovative technologies, we focus on critical areas such as climate and energy, water stewardship, circular resources, air pollution control, and biodiversity conservation to advance sustainable development.

To accomplish this, we partner with middle and high schools, universities and research institutions to promote STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) education and strengthen our efforts in semiconductor industry-academia collaboration.
Care for the underprivileged. The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the TSMC Charity Foundation focus on addressing society’s evolving needs. The two foundations integrate and invest internal and external resources to empower young generation, support rural communities, provide emergency relief, and promote art and cultural literacy.
For further information on our ESG initiatives, please refer to our annual Sustainability Reports, available on our ESG website at https://esg.tsmc.com/en-US/resources/ESG-data-hub. The information contained on our website is not incorporated herein by reference and does not constitute part of this annual report.
Electricity and Water
We have occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by our electricity supplier, or other power consumers on the same power grid. Such power outages, dips or surges may lead to interruptions in our production schedule. The semiconductor manufacturing process uses extensive amounts of electricity and water. Due to changes in the energy policy of the government, the growth of manufacturers in the Hsinchu Science Park, Southern Taiwan Science Park and Central Taiwan Science Park, and the droughts that Taiwan experiences from time to time, there is concern regarding future availability of sufficient electricity and water for our production in Taiwan. To help address these potential shortages and avoid the potential impact that insufficient electricity and water supplies may have on our semiconductor production, we have adopted various natural resources conservation methodologies. Moreover, we have encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we became subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which increased by 25% as compared to the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. In October 2024, the electricity tariff rate further increased by 14%. The hike in electricity prices could increase our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results. Please see “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business” for a discussion of the risk related to shortages or increased prices in electricity and water.
Risk Management
We employ a balanced risk-reward approach to risk management to optimize business returns. This applies to all aspects of the business, including our commitment to ESG issues in delivering long-term value to all stakeholders. Our risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors and signed by the Chairman and CEO. We are committed to a proactive and robust risk management system that assists the Company in making well-considered, risk-based decisions that fulfill the corporate vision and deliver sustainable value to TSMC and its stakeholders.

Adhering closely to the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 31000: 2018 Risk Management System and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework is a systematic approach that enables us to respond to the changing dynamics in the business environment, as well as to capitalize on business opportunities. Our ERM framework specifies the risk governance structure, the management process that integrates business operations, and the tools that facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risks. A formalized training and communication program to build risk competency and foster a risk-aware culture helps management make informed risk-based decisions while implementing corporate strategies. We are committed to maintaining operational resilience and business continuity by following standards that enable us to respond effectively to business disruptions.
To mitigate the operational impact of crisis events, we implement pre-crisis risk assessments, response procedures and recovery plans. To enhance operational preparedness, we conduct exercises and drills to validate emergency responses, crisis management, and business continuity plans. In major incidents or crisis events, the crisis management guidelines are followed. The central crisis command center (“C4”), headed by the Chairman and CEO and comprised of senior executives across key functions, provides guidance and decision-making to maintain response readiness, including timely communication to key stakeholders.
We also maintain insurance with respect to our facilities, equipment and inventories. The insurance for the fabs and their equipment covers, subject to some limitations, various risks, including earthquake, fire, typhoon and other risks generally up to the respective policy limit for their replacement values and lost profits due to business interruption. In addition, we have insurance policies covering losses with respect to the construction of all our fabs. Equipment and inventories in transit are also insured. While we maintain insurance to cover certain types of losses, no assurance can be given that insurance will fully cover all the losses that may arise or that our emergency responses and business continuity plans will be effective in preventing or reducing losses.

Overview
We manufacture a variety of semiconductors based on designs provided by our customers. Our business model is commonly called a “dedicated semiconductor foundry.” As a leader of the foundry segment, our net revenue and net income attributable to shareholders of the parent were NT$2,161,736 million and NT$851,740 million in 2023, and NT$2,894,308 million (US$88,268 million) and NT$1,158,380 million (US$35,327 million) in 2024, respectively. Please see “ – Year-to-Year Comparisons – Net Revenue” for a discussion of the changes in net revenue from 2023 to 2024.
The principal source of our revenue is wafer fabrication, which accounted for approximately 87% of our net revenue in 2024. The rest of our net revenue was mainly derived from packaging and testing services, mask making, design, and royalty income. Factors that significantly impact our revenue include:
 
 
•
 
worldwide demand and capacity supply for semiconductor products;
 
 
•
 
pricing;
 
 
•
 
production capacity;
 
 
•
 
technology development; and
 
 
•
 
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
While the above factors are significant factors, four of which are elaborated as follows:
Pricing. We establish pricing levels for specific periods of time with our customers, some of which are subject to adjustment during the course of that period to take into account market conditions and other factors. We believe that customers find value in our flexible manufacturing capabilities, focus on customer service and timely delivery of high yield products, and this value is reflected in our pricing. Our pricing enables us to continue to invest significantly in research and development to deliver ever-improving products to our customers, and sustain healthy financial conditions to expand capacity and support customers’ growth.
Production Capacity. We currently own and operate our semiconductor manufacturing facilities. For the years of 2023 and 2024, our production capacity was approximately 16 million and 17 million 12-inch equivalent wafers, respectively.
Technology Development. Our operation utilizes a variety of process technologies, ranging from mature process technologies of 0.25 micron or above circuit resolutions to advanced process technologies of 3-nanometer circuit resolutions. The table below presents a breakdown of wafer revenue by circuit resolution during the periods indicated:

Table of Contents
In 2024, the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer revenues represented 18%, 34% and 17% of total wafer revenue, respectively. Advanced technologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 69% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2023.
In 2023, the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer revenues represented 6%, 33% and 19% of total wafer revenue, respectively. Advanced technologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 53% in 2022.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars while we publish our financial statements in NT dollars. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates of the NT dollar against the U.S. dollar would have a significant impact on our reported revenue. The NT dollar depreciation in 2024 had a favorable effect on our revenue, with weighted average exchange rates of the NT dollar per U.S. dollar depreciating from NT$31.19 in 2023 to NT$32.13 in 2024.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty
Summarized below are our accounting policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial results and also involve the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain in nature. Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgments and assumptions. Certain accounting policies are particularly critical because of their significance to our reported financial results and the possibility that future events may differ significantly from the conditions and assumptions underlying the estimates used and judgments made by us in preparing our financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this annual report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Judgments
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to our customers’ specified locations.
Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (“EUI” and “CIP”). Commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria we use to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
Judgments on Lease Terms. In determining a lease term, we consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within our control occurs.
Critical Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty
Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances. Sales returns and other allowances is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. We periodically review the reasonableness of the estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, actual returns and allowances could be different from our estimates. If the actual returns are greater than our estimated amount, we could be required to record an additional liability, which would have a negative impact on our recorded revenue and gross margin. For further information, please refer to note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value for finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, supplies and spare parts. Inventory write-downs are made on an item-by-item basis, except where it may be appropriate to group similar or related items.
A significant amount of our manufacturing costs is fixed because our extensive manufacturing facilities (which provide us large production capacity) require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they become operational. When the capacity utilization increases, the fixed manufacturing costs are spread over a larger amount of output, which would lower the inventory cost per unit.

Table of Contents
We evaluate our ending inventory based on standard cost under normal capacity utilization, and reduce the carrying value of our inventory when the actual capacity utilization is higher than normal capacity utilization. No adjustment is made to the carrying value of inventory when the actual capacity utilization is at or lower than normal capacity utilization. Normal capacity utilization is established based on historic loadings compared to total available capacity in our wafer manufacturing fabs.
We also evaluate our ending inventory and reduce the carrying value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items by an amount that is the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon, which is generally 180 days or less.
Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-Use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill. We assess the impairment of tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Indicators we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 
•
 
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
 
 
•
 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy; and
 
 
•
 
significant unfavorable industry or economic trends.
When we determine that the carrying value of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment for tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill based on projected future cash flow. If the tangible assets, right-of-use assets or intangible assets other than goodwill are determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the recoverable amount, measured at the present value of discounted cash flows attributable to the assets, is less than their carrying value. Such cash flow analysis includes assumptions about expected future economic and market conditions, the applicable discount rate, and the future revenue generation from the use or disposition of the assets. We also perform a periodic review to identify assets that are no longer used and are not expected to be used in future periods and record an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying amount of the tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill exceeds the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount subsequently increases, the impairment loss previously recognized will be reversed to the extent of the increase in the recoverable amount, provided that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, we are required to review for impairment groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. We determine the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groups. In addition, we determine the remaining useful lives of assets and the expected future revenue and expenses associated with the assets. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future periods. Our projection for future cash flow is generally lower during periods of reduced earnings. As a result, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are already otherwise depressed. For further information, including impairment losses recognized in 2023 and 2024, please refer to note 15, note 16 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets. When we have temporary differences in the amount of tax expenses recorded for tax purposes and financial reporting purposes, we may be able to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in future periods. We generally recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future to utilize such assets. The income tax benefit or expense is recorded when there is a net change in our total deferred tax assets and liabilities in a period. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences may be utilized. Specifically, the realization of deferred income tax assets is impacted by our expected future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”), the surtax imposed on unappropriated earnings and the amount of tax credits that can be utilized within the statutory period. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, we considered past performance, the general outlook of the semiconductor industry, business conditions, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
 
27


Table of Contents
Because the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized is based, in part, on our forecast of future profitability, it is inherently uncertain and subjective. Changes in market conditions and our assumptions may cause the actual future profitability to differ materially from our current expectation, which may require us to increase or decrease the deferred tax assets that we have recorded. For further information, including the amount of deferred tax assets as of the end of 2023 and 2024, please refer to note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.
Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates. In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, we mainly take into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.

Net Revenue
Our net revenue in 2024 increased by 33.9% from 2023, which was mainly attributed to an increase in ASP due to a higher proportion of advanced technology (7-nanometer and below) revenue, an increase in wafer shipments, and a depreciation of the NT dollar against the U.S. dollar. We shipped approximately 13 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2024 compared to 12 million in 2023.
Gross Margin
Our gross margin fluctuates with the level of capacity utilization, price change, cost improvement, product mix and exchange rate, among other factors. Furthermore, our gross margin would be negatively impacted in the year when a new technology is introduced.
In 2024, our gross margin increased to 56.1% of net revenue from 54.4% in 2023, mainly attributable to higher capacity utilization and productivity gains, and partially offset by 3-nanometer ramp-up and higher electricity cost.

Operating expenses increased by NT$47,237 million in 2024, or 18.6%, from 2023.
Research and Development Expenses
We remain strongly committed to being the leader in advanced process technologies development. We believe that continuing investment in process technologies is essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve.
Research and development expenses increased by NT$21,812 million in 2024, or 12.0%, from 2023. The increases were mainly attributed to a higher level of research activities for 14-angstrom, 16-angstrom, and 2-nanometer process technologies, as we continued to advance to smaller processing nodes.
We plan to continue our investment in technology research and development in 2025.
General and Administrative and Marketing Expenses
General and administrative and marketing expenses in 2024 increased by NT$25,425 million, or 35.6%, compared to 2023, mainly reflecting higher start-up expenses of overseas fabs preparation and employee profit sharing expenses due to higher net income.

Income tax expenses increased by NT$120,028 million in 2024, or 93.6%, from 2023. The increase was mainly attributed to higher taxable income. In addition, the increase in surtax imposed on unappropriated earnings was a result of higher undistributed earnings in 2024.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, current marketable securities, and issuances of corporate bonds.
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations for 2024 was NT$1,826,177 million (US$55,693 million), reflecting an increase of NT$584,210 million from 2023.
Our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities increased to NT$2,422,019 million (US$73,864 million) as of December 31, 2024, compared to NT$1,687,644 million as of December 31, 2023. The current marketable securities primarily consisted of fixed income securities. In 2024, we issued NT dollar-denominated corporate bonds totaling NT$34,300 million (US$1,046 million). For further information, please refer to note 18 and note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.

Cash and cash equivalents increased by NT$662,199 million in 2024, following an increase of NT$122,614 million in 2023.
Operating Activities
In 2024, we generated NT$1,826,177 million (US$55,693 million) net cash from operating activities, as compared to NT$1,241,967 million in 2023. The net cash generated from operating activities was primarily from NT$1,405,840 million in income before income tax and NT$662,796 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by income tax payment, net changes in working capital and others of NT$242,459 million. The higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2024 were mainly attributed to continuing investment in production capacity for advanced technologies.
In 2023, we generated NT$1,241,967 million net cash from operating activities, as compared to NT$1,610,599 million in 2022. The net cash generated from operating activities was primarily from NT$979,316 million in income before income tax and NT$532,191 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by income tax payment, net changes in working capital and others of NT$269,540 million. The higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2023 were mainly attributed to continuing investment in production capacity for advanced technologies.
Investing Activities
In 2024, net cash used in investing activities was NT$864,843 million (US$26,375 million), as compared to NT$906,120 million in 2023. The primary use of cash in investing activities in 2024 was for capital expenditures of NT$956,007 million.
In 2023, net cash used in investing activities was NT$906,120 million, as compared to NT$1,190,928 million in 2022. The primary use of cash in investing activities in 2023 was for capital expenditures of NT$949,817 million.
Our capital expenditures for 2024 were primarily related to:
 
 
•
 
installing and expanding capacity, mainly for 2-nanometer, 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes, including building/facility expansion for Fab 20, Fab 21 and Fab 22;
 
 
•
 
expanding capacity for specialty technologies and advanced packaging, including building/facility expansion for Fab 23; and
 
 
•
 
investing in research and development projects for new process technologies.
See “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business” section for the risks associated with the inability of raising the requisite funding for our expansion programs. Please also see “Item 4. Information on The Company – Capacity Management and Technology Upgrade Plans” for discussion of our capacity management and capital expenditures.

During 2024, we used derivative financial instruments to partially hedge the currency exchange rate risk related to non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, certain forecasted transactions, and interest rate risk related to our fixed income investments. See “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion about currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and derivative financial instruments we used to hedge such risks. See also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy of derivative financial instruments, and note 8, note 11 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our derivative financial instruments transactions.
We provided letters of credit and entrusted financial institutions to provide performance guarantees. See note 36 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Significant amount of capital is required to build, expand, and upgrade our production facilities and equipment. Our capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be between US$38 billion and US$42 billion, which, depending on market conditions, may be adjusted later.

Taxation
The corporate income tax rate in R.O.C. is 20%. The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented since January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in Taiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that develop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified R&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes. We are eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation.
The alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) imposed under the R.O.C. AMT Act is a supplemental income tax which applies if the amount of regular income tax calculated pursuant to the R.O.C. Income Tax Act and relevant laws and regulations is below the amount of basic tax prescribed under the R.O.C. AMT Act. The taxable income for calculating AMT includes most income that is exempt from income tax under various legislations, such as tax holidays. The prevailing AMT rate for business entities is 12%.
We were eligible for five-year tax holidays for income generated from construction and capacity expansions of production facilities according to regulations under the Statute for Upgrading Industries of the R.O.C. The exemption period may begin at any time within five years, as applicable, following the completion of a construction or expansion of production facilities. The Statute for Upgrading Industries expired at the end of 2009. However, under the Grandfather Clause, we can continue to be eligible for five-year tax holidays if the relevant investment plans were approved by R.O.C. tax authority before the expiration of the Statute. Pursuant to the Grandfather Clause, we commenced the exemption period for part of Fab 15 (Phase I to IV) and part of Fab 14 (Phase III to IV) in 2018. The aggregate tax benefits of such exemption periods in 2022 were NT$96,378 million, net of AMT effect. This five-year tax holiday expired at the end of 2022.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Summary Financial Information of the Obligor Group
The debt securities issued by TSMC Arizona under an indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of October 18, 2021, among TSMC Arizona, as the issuer, TSMC, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee, are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed as to payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, by TSMC. TSMC Arizona and TSMC are referred to collectively as the Obligor Group. Each guarantee provided under the Indenture is referred to as a Guarantee and collectively, the Guarantees. TSMC Arizona is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Arizona and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC. As of December 31, 2024, the debt securities issued by TSMC Arizona are: (i) US$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the 1.750% Guaranteed Notes due 2026, (ii) US$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2.500% Guaranteed Notes due 2031, (iii) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.125% Guaranteed Notes due 2041, (iv) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.250% Guaranteed Notes due 2051, (v) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.875% Guaranteed Notes due 2027, (vi) US$500 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% Guaranteed Notes due 2029, (vii) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 4.250% Guaranteed Notes due 2032, and (viii) US$1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 4.500% Guaranteed Notes due 2052.
Under the terms of the Indenture and the Guarantees, TSMC fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each holder the full and prompt payment of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, such debt securities (including any Additional Amounts, as defined in the Indenture, payable in respect thereof) when and as the same shall become due and payable as provided in such debt securities. TSMC (i) agrees that its obligations under the Guarantees will be enforceable irrespective of any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the debt securities or the Indenture and (ii) waives its right to require the trustee to pursue or exhaust its legal or equitable remedies against the issuer prior to exercising its rights under the Guarantees. Moreover, if at any time any amount paid under a debt security or the Indenture is rescinded or must otherwise be restored, the rights of the holders of the debt securities under the Guarantees will be reinstated with respect to such payments as though such payment had not been made.
The Guarantees (i) constitute senior unsecured obligations of TSMC, (ii) at all times rank at least equally with all other present and future senior unsecured obligations of TSMC, except as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (iii) are senior in right of payment to all future subordinated obligations of TSMC and (iv) are effectively subordinated to secured obligations of TSMC, to the extent of the assets serving as security therefor.

Climate Change Related Issues
The manufacturing, assembling and testing of our products require the use of chemicals and materials that are subject to environmental, climate related, health and safety laws and regulations issued worldwide as well as international accords such as the Paris Agreement. The Climate Change Response Act of the R.O.C., effective February 2023, set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and established a carbon fee system to collect carbon fees. For emitters with direct and indirect emissions exceeding a certain threshold, carbon fees will be levied starting from 2025. As our emissions from each fab in Taiwan exceed the current regulatory threshold, we will start to pay carbon fees from 2026 (for the 2025 fees), which will result in increased manufacturing costs for us. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is regularly reviewing various environmental issues to develop laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate change. The impact of such laws and regulations is currently indeterminable. Please see detailed risk factors related to the impact of climate change regulations and international accords in “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business. ” Please also see our compliance record with Taiwan and international environmental and climate-related laws and regulations in “Item 4. Information on The Company – Environmental and Climate Related Laws and Regulations.”

DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES
Directors and Executive Officers
MANAGEMENT
Members of our Board of Directors are elected by our shareholders. Our Board of Directors is currently composed of ten directors. Of our current ten directors, seven are independent directors: Sir Peter L. Bonfield, Mr. Michael R. Splinter, Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov, Dr. L. Rafael Reif, Ms. Ursula M. Burns, Ms. Lynn L. Elsenhans and Mr. Chuan Lin. The chairman of the Board of Directors is elected by the directors. The chairman of the Board of Directors presides at all meetings of the Board of Directors, and also has the authority to act as our representative. The term of office for directors is three years.
Pursuant to the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, effective from January 1, 2007, a public company is required to either establish an audit committee or to have supervisors. A public company’s audit committee should be composed of all of its independent directors but not less than three, of which at least one member should have accounting or related financial management expertise, and the relevant provisions under the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, the R.O.C. Company Act and other laws applicable to the supervisors are also applicable to the audit committee. Pursuant to the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, effective from March 18, 2011, we are also required to establish a compensation committee which must be composed of qualified independent members as defined under local law. We established our audit committee (the “Audit Committee”) and compensation committee (the “Compensation Committee”) in 2002 and 2003, respectively (several years before being legally required to do so), both of which are now composed entirely of independent directors. In February 2023, our Board of Directors approved the renaming of the Audit Committee as “Audit and Risk Committee” and the Compensation Committee as “Compensation and People Development Committee”, and the establishment of a Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, each effective as of February 14, 2023.
Pursuant to the R.O.C. Company Act, a person may serve as our director in his personal capacity or as the representative of another legal entity. A director who serves as the representative of a legal entity may be removed or replaced at any time at the discretion of that legal entity, and the replacement director may serve the remainder of the term of office of the replaced director. For example, the National Development Fund of the R.O.C., one of our largest shareholders, has served as our director since our founding. As a corporate entity, the National Development Fund is required to appoint a representative to act on its behalf. Mr. Chin-Ching Liu has been the representative of the National Development Fund since June 6, 2024.
In June 2024, our former Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, retired from TSMC. Our CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, was elected in our Shareholders’ Meeting in June 2024 to succeed as our Chairman.
In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved the appointment of Senior Vice President of R&D, Dr. Y.J. Mii and Senior Vice President of Operations, Mr. Y.P. Chyn, as Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers (“Co-COOs”) of TSMC, effective on March 1, 2024. The two Executive Vice Presidents and Co-COOs will report directly to Chief Executive Officer Dr. C.C. Wei.
The following tables set forth each director and executive officer’s name, position and years with our company, the age range of each director and the year in which each director’s term expires as of February 28, 2025. The business address for each of our directors and executive officers is No. 8, Li Hsin Road 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China.

The RSAs granted under the 2024 Rules held by each of these directors and executives represent less than one percent of our total outstanding common shares.
Employee Restricted Stock Awards Rules for Years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024
We adopted the Employee Restricted Stock Awards Rules for each of Year 2021 (the “2021 Rules”), Year 2022 (the “2022 Rules”), Year 2023, (the “2023 Rules”), and Year 2024 (the “2024 Rules”) to attract and retain corporate executives and/or critical talents at TSMC and/or its subsidiaries. These rules link the compensation of employees with shareholders’ interests and/or our ESG achievements. The 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules, 2023 Rules, and 2024 Rules authorized the grant of up to 2,600,000 common shares, up to 3,065,000 common shares, up to 6,249,000 common shares, and up to 4,185,000 common shares, with par value of NT$10 per share, respectively. The grants are in the form of RSAs. The 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules, 2023 Rules, and 2024 Rules became effective on August 6, 2021, July 25, 2022, December 28, 2023, and July 31, 2024, respectively.
Under these rules, RSAs may be granted to full-time executives and/or critical talents who meet specific performance requirements. The number of RSAs granted is determined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Compensation and People Development Committee and the Board of Directors. The number of RSAs granted under the 2023 Rules and 2024 Rules also requires approval from the Audit and Risk Committee. Grants under these rules are made free of charge to the recipients and are subject to certain vesting conditions, as separately outlined in the rules for each respective year.
Under each of the 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules, 2023 Rules, and 2024 Rules, the maximum amount of RSAs that may vest each year are as follows: 50% on the first anniversary of the grant, 25% on the second anniversary and 25% on the third anniversary.
Issuances under these rules can be granted over a period of one year from the respective effective date of the 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules and 2023 Rules. Issuance under the 2024 Rules can be granted over a period of two years from the effective date. In February 2022, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the issuance of 1,387,000 units of RSAs under the 2021 Rules. In February 2023, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the issuance of 2,110,000 units of RSAs under the 2022 Rules. In February 2024, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the issuance of 2,960,000 units of RSAs under the 2023 Rules. In August 2024, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the issuance of 2,353,000 units of RSAs under the 2024 Rules.
As of March 1, 2025, among the total 1,387,000 units of RSAs issued under the 2021 Rules, 603,443 units have vested and 783,557 units have been reclaimed, and no RSAs issued under the 2021 Rules remain outstanding.
Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2022, we established an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), which provides an opportunity for eligible employees to purchase our ADSs or common shares through voluntary automatic payroll deductions, to contribute to a real and sustainable culture of employees as shareholders. The ESPP became effective on May 10, 2022 and was implemented from October 1, 2022. ADSs and common shares available for purchase by participants under the ESPP will be authorized and issued ADSs or authorized and issued common shares acquired by the administrator of the ESPP on behalf of participants. We shall contribute to a participant’s contribution account so that fifteen percent (15%) of the purchase price for each ADS or common share purchased under the ESPP for a participant is funded by the employer contribution. We may, with thirty (30) days’ notice to eligible employees, change such percentage for the employer contribution.
Compensation
According to our Articles of Incorporation, not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits, after recovering any losses incurred in prior years, may be distributed as compensation to our directors and at least one percent of our annual profits may be distributed as profit sharing bonuses to employees, including executive officers. Compensation to directors is always paid in cash, while bonuses to our executive officers may be granted in cash, stock, or stock options or the combination of all these three. Individual awards are based on each individual’s job responsibility, contribution and performance. See note 29 to our consolidated financial statements. Under our Articles of Incorporation, directors who also serve as executive officers are not entitled to any director compensation.

Pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, our employees participate in our profits sharing program by way of a bonus. Employees in the aggregate are entitled to not less than 1% of our annual profits (defined under local law), after recovering any losses incurred in prior years. Our practice has been to determine the amount of the bonus based on our operating results and industry practice in the R.O.C. In 2023 and 2024, we distributed employees’ business performance bonus of NT$50,091 million and employees’ cash profit sharing bonus of NT$50,091 million to our employees in relation to year 2023 profits. In 2024 and 2025, we distributed employees’ business performance bonus of NT$70,296 million (US$2,144 million) to our employees in relation to year 2024 profits. Employees’ cash profit sharing bonus of NT$70,296 million (US$2,144 million) in relation to year 2024 profits will be distributed in July 2025.
As to employee relations, we value two-way communication and are committed to keeping our communication channels open and transparent between the management level and their subordinates. In addition, we are dedicated to providing diverse employee engagement programs, which support our goals in reinforcing close rapport with employees and maintaining harmonious labor relations.

Related Party Transactions
Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation (“VIS”)
In 1994, we, the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs and other investors established VIS, then an integrated DRAM manufacturer. VIS commenced commercial production in 1995 and listed its shares on the Taipei Exchange in March 1998. In 2004, VIS completely terminated its DRAM production and became a dedicated foundry company. As of February 28, 2025, we owned approximately 27.6% of the equity interest in VIS.
Pursuant to the terms of a manufacturing agreement between both parties, VIS was obligated to use its best commercial efforts to manufacture wafers at specified yield rates for us up to a fixed amount of reserved capacity per month, and TSMC was required to use its best commercial efforts to maintain utilization of such reserved capacity. In 2024, we had total purchases of NT$759 million (US$23 million) from VIS, representing 0.1% of our total cost of revenue.
Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (“SSMC”)
SSMC is a joint venture in Singapore that we established with Philips and EDB to produce integrated circuits by means of advanced submicron manufacturing processes. These integrated circuits are made pursuant to the product design specifications provided primarily by us and Philips under an agreement with Philips and EDB (the “SSMC Shareholders Agreement”) in March 1999, and primarily by us and NXP, subsequent to the assignment by Philips of its rights to NXP and NXP’s assumption of Philips’ obligations under the SSMC Shareholders Agreement pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement effective September 25, 2006. SSMC’s business is limited to manufacturing wafers for us, our subsidiaries, NXP and NXP’s subsidiaries. On November 15, 2006, we and NXP exercised the option rights under the SSMC Shareholders Agreement to purchase all of the SSMC shares owned by EDB. As a result, we now own 38.8%, and NXP owns 61.2% of SSMC. While we, together with NXP, have the right to purchase up to 100% of SSMC’s annual capacity, we and NXP are required to purchase, in the aggregate, at least 70% of SSMC’s full capacity. See below for a detailed discussion of the contract terms we entered into with SSMC.
We entered into a technology cooperation agreement with SSMC effective on March 30, 1999 in which SSMC agreed to base at least a major part of its production activities on processes compatible to those in use in our metal oxide semiconductor (“MOS”) integrated circuits wafer volume production fabs. In return, we agreed to provide SSMC with access to and benefit of the technical knowledge and experience relating to certain processes in use in our MOS integrated circuits wafer volume production fabs and to assist SSMC by rendering certain technical services in connection with its production activities. In addition, we granted to SSMC limited licenses of related intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us for the purpose of MOS integrated circuit production for the sole use in manufacturing products for us. SSMC pays to us during, and up to three years after, the term of this agreement a remuneration of a fixed percentage of the net selling price of all products manufactured by SSMC. In 2024, we had total purchases of NT$3,861 million (US$118 million) from SSMC, representing 0.3% of our total cost of revenue.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information
Please see “Item 18. Financial Statements”. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, no significant change has occurred since the date of the annual consolidated financial statements.
Legal Proceedings
As is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, we have received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that our technologies, our manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by us or the use of those semiconductors by our customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against us and settlement payments by us. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, we could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on our operations. We are also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm our business and distract our management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or prospects, and subject us to potential significant legal liability.
In February 2025, Longitude Licensing Ltd. and Marlin Semiconductor Limited (collectively, “Marlin”) filed complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC and its customers infringe five U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation on March 21, 2025. The outcome cannot be determined, and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.
Other than the matter described above, we were not a party to any material litigation as of December 31, 2024 and are not currently a party to any other material litigation.
Dividends and Dividend Policy
Except as otherwise specified in the Articles of Incorporation or under the R.O.C. laws, we will not pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders when there are no earnings. Our profits may be distributed by way of cash dividend, stock dividend, or a combination of cash and stock. Pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, distributions of profits shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. In addition, the ratio for stock dividends shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution. Distribution of stock dividends is subject to approval by the R.O.C. FSC.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Description of Common Shares
We are organized under the laws of the R.O.C. Set forth below is a description of our common shares, including summaries of the material provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, the R.O.C. Company Act, the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Please refer to further information set forth in exhibit 1.1 to this annual report.
General
Our authorized share capital is NT$280,500,000,000, divided into 28,050,000,000 common shares, of which 500,000,000 common shares are reserved for the issuance for our employee stock options and among which 25,932,733,242 common shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and February 28, 2025. No employee stock options were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and February 28, 2025. On March 1, 2025, we reclaimed 17,341 common shares, 26,380 common shares and 74,000 common shares formerly granted in the form of RSAs pursuant to our 2021 Rules, 2022 Rules and 2023 Rules, respectively. Please see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees – Share Ownership” for a further discussion.
The R.O.C. Company Act, the R.O.C. Act for Establishment and Administration of Science Parks and the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act provide that any change in the issued share capital of a public company, such as us, requires the approval of its board of directors, (or, for capital reduction, a resolution of its shareholders meeting), the approval of, or the registration with, the R.O.C. FSC and the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Science Park Administration (as applicable) and/or an amendment to its articles of incorporation (if such change also involves a change in the authorized share capital).
There are no provisions under either R.O.C. law or the deposit agreement under which holders of ADSs would be required to forfeit the common shares represented by ADSs.

Table of Contents
Dividends and Distributions
An R.O.C. company is generally not permitted to distribute dividends or to make any other distributions to shareholders in respect of any year for which it did not have either earnings or retained earnings. In addition, before distributing a dividend to shareholders following the end of a fiscal year, the company must recover any past losses, pay all outstanding taxes and set aside in a legal reserve, until such time as its legal reserve equals its paid-in capital, 10% of its net income for that fiscal year (less any past losses and outstanding tax), and may set aside a special reserve.
Before the R.O.C. Company Act was amended in August 2018, the Board of Directors submitted our financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and any proposal for the distribution of a dividend or the making of any other distribution to shareholders from our earnings or retained earnings (subject to compliance with the requirements described above) at the end of the preceding fiscal year to the shareholders for their approval at the annual general meeting of our shareholders. All common shares outstanding and fully paid as of the relevant record date are entitled to share equally in any dividend or other distribution so approved. Dividends may be distributed in cash, in the form of common shares or a combination thereof, as determined by the shareholders at the meeting.
The R.O.C. Company Act, amended in August 2018, allows a company, as authorized by its articles of incorporation, to distribute dividends on a quarterly basis or a semi-annual basis and to have its board of directors to approve the dividends in cash. Our 2019 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting has approved the amendments to the Articles of Incorporation to authorize our Board of Directors to approve cash dividends after the close of each quarter.
In addition to permitting dividends to be paid out of earnings or retained earnings, the R.O.C. Company Act permits us to make distributions to our shareholders in cash or in the form of common shares from capital surplus and the legal reserve. However, dividend distribution out of our legal reserve can only be effected to the extent of the excessive amount of the accumulated legal reserve over 25% of our paid-in capital.
For information as to R.O.C. taxes on dividends and distributions, see “– Taxation – R.O.C. Taxation”.
Preemptive Rights and Issues of Additional Common Shares
Under the R.O.C. Company Act, when a public company, such as us, issues new shares of common stock for cash, 10% to 15% of the issue must be offered to its employees. The remaining new shares must be offered to existing shareholders in a preemptive rights offering, subject to a requirement under the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act that at least 10% of these issuances must be offered to the public. This percentage can be increased by a resolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting, thereby limiting or waiving the preemptive rights of existing shareholders. The preemptive rights provisions do not apply to limited circumstances, such as:
 
 
•
 
issuance of new shares upon conversion of convertible bonds; and
 
 
•
 
offerings of new shares through a private placement approved at a shareholders’ meeting.
Authorized but unissued shares of any class may be issued at such times and, subject to the above-mentioned provisions of the R.O.C. Company Act and the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The shares with respect to which preemptive rights have been waived may be freely offered, subject to compliance with applicable R.O.C. law.
Meetings of Shareholders
Meetings of our shareholders may be general meetings or special meetings. General meetings of shareholders are generally held in Hsinchu, Taiwan, within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Special meetings of shareholders may be convened by resolution of the Board of Directors whenever it deems necessary, or under certain circumstances, by shareholders or the Audit Committee. For a public company such as us, notice in writing of shareholders’ meetings, stating the place, time and purpose thereof, must be sent to each shareholder at least thirty days (in the case of general meetings) and fifteen days (in the case of special meetings) prior to the date set for each meeting.
Voting Rights
A holder of common shares has one vote for each common share. Except as otherwise provided by law, a resolution may be adopted by the holders of a simple majority of the total issued and outstanding common shares represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which a majority of the holders of the total issued and outstanding common shares are present. The election of directors at a shareholders’ meeting is by cumulative voting. As authorized under the R.O.C. Company Act and as required by the R.O.C. FSC, we have adopted a nomination procedure for election of our directors in our Articles of Incorporation. According to our Articles of Incorporation, ballots for the election of directors and independent directors are cast separately.

Table of Contents
The R.O.C. Company Act also provides that in order to approve certain major corporate actions, including but not limited to, (i) any amendment to the articles of incorporation (which is required for, among other actions, any increase in authorized share capital), (ii) execution, modification or termination of any contracts regarding leasing of all business or joint operations or mandate of the company’s business to other persons, (iii) the dissolution, amalgamation or spin-off of a company or the transfer of the whole or an important part of its business or its properties or the taking over of the whole of the business or properties of any other company which would have a significant impact on the acquiring company’s operations, (iv) the removal of directors or supervisors or (v) the distribution of any stock dividend, a meeting of the shareholders must be convened with a quorum of holders of at least two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock at which the holders of at least a majority of the common stock represented at the meeting vote in favor thereof. However, in the case of a publicly held company such as us, such a resolution may be adopted by the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock are present.
A shareholder may be represented at a shareholders’ meeting by proxy. A valid proxy must be delivered to us at least five days prior to the commencement of the shareholders’ meeting.
Holders of ADSs will not have the right to exercise voting rights with respect to the common shares represented thereby, except as described in “— Voting of Deposited Securities”.
Other Rights of Shareholders
Under the R.O.C. Company Act, dissenting shareholders are entitled to appraisal rights in the event of amalgamation, spin-off or certain other major corporate actions. A dissenting shareholder may request us to redeem all of the shares owned by that shareholder at a fair price to be determined by mutual agreement or a court order if agreement cannot be reached. A shareholder may exercise these appraisal rights by serving a written notice on us prior to the related shareholders’ meeting and by raising an objection at the shareholders’ meeting. In addition to appraisal rights, any shareholder has the right to sue for the annulment of any resolution adopted at a shareholders’ meeting where the procedures were legally defective within thirty days after the date of such shareholders’ meeting. One or more shareholders who have held one percent or more of our issued and outstanding shares for six months or longer may require the audit committee to bring a derivative action against a director for that director’s liability to us as a result of that director’s unlawful actions or failure to act. In addition, one or more shareholders who have held three percent or more of our issued and outstanding shares for over a year may require the board of directors to convene a special shareholders’ meeting by sending a written request to the board of directors, while one or more shareholders who have held over 50% of our issued and outstanding shares for three months may convene a special shareholders’ meeting by themselves.
The R.O.C. Company Act allows shareholder(s) holding 1% or more of the total issued shares of a company to, during the period of time prescribed by the company, submit one proposal in writing or through any electronic means designated by us, which contains no more than three hundred words (Chinese characters) for discussion at the general meeting of shareholders. In addition, if a company adopts a nomination procedure for election of directors or supervisors in its articles of incorporation, shareholders representing 1% or more of the total issued shares of such company may submit a candidate list in writing to the company along with relevant information and supporting documents.
Register of Shareholders and Record Dates
Our share registrar, CTBC Bank Co., Ltd., maintains the register of our shareholders at its office in Taipei, Taiwan. Under the R.O.C. Company Act, the transfer of common shares in registered form is effected by endorsement of the transferor’s and transferee’s seals on the share certificates and delivery of the related share certificates. In order to assert shareholders’ rights against us, however, the transferee must have his name and address registered on the register of shareholders. Shareholders are required to file their respective specimen signatures or seals with us. The settlement of trading in the common shares is carried out on the book-entry system maintained by the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation and therefore, the share transfer will follow the procedures of the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation.
The R.O.C. Company Act permits us to set a record date and close the register of shareholders for a specified period in order for us to determine the shareholders or pledgees that are entitled to certain rights pertaining to common shares by giving advance public notice. Under the R.O.C. Company Act, our register of shareholders should be closed for a period of sixty days, thirty days and five days immediately before each general meeting of shareholders, special meeting of shareholders and record date of dividend distribution, respectively.

Annual Financial Statements
Under the R.O.C. Company Act, ten days before the general meeting of shareholders, our annual financial statements must be available at our principal office in Hsinchu for inspection by the shareholders.
Acquisition of Common Shares by Us
With minor exceptions, neither we nor our subsidiaries may acquire our common shares under the R.O.C. Company Act. However, under the R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, we may, by a board resolution adopted by majority consent at a meeting with two-thirds of our directors present, purchase our common shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or by a tender offer, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the R.O.C. FSC, for any of the following purposes: (i) to transfer shares to our employees; (ii) to satisfy our obligations to provide our common shares upon exercise or conversion of any warrants, convertible bonds or convertible preferred shares; or (iii) if necessary, to maintain our credit and our shareholders’ equity (such as for the purpose of supporting the trading price of our common shares during market dislocations), provided that the common shares so purchased shall be cancelled thereafter.
We are not allowed to purchase more than ten percent of our total issued and outstanding common shares. In addition, we may not spend more than the aggregate amount of our retained earnings, premium from issuing stock and the realized portion of the capital reserve to purchase our common shares.
We may not pledge or hypothecate any purchased common shares. In addition, we may not exercise any shareholders’ rights attached to such common shares. In the event that we purchase our common shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, our affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders, together with their respective spouses, minor children and nominees holding more than 10% of our total shares, as well as the respective spouses, minor children and nominees of the foregoing persons, are prohibited from selling any of our common shares during the period in which we purchase our common shares.
Liquidation Rights
In the event of our liquidation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses, taxes and distributions to holders of preferred shares, if any, will be distributed pro rata to our shareholders in accordance with the R.O.C. Company Act.
Transaction Restrictions
The R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act (i) requires each director, supervisor, officer or shareholder, together with his/her spouse and minor children and its/his/her nominees, holding more than ten percent of the shares of a public company to report the amount of that person’s shareholding (as well as the shareholding of his/her spouse and minor children and its/his/her nominees), on a monthly basis, to that company and (ii) limits the number of shares that can be sold or transferred on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or on the Taipei Exchange by that person, as well as his/her respective spouse and minor children and its/his/her nominees, per day. The above sale and transfer of shares can be made only after that person (as well as his/her respective spouse and minor children and its/his/her nominees) has held the shares for more than six months and that person should report to the R.O.C. FSC at least three days before the intended sale or transfer; unless the number of shares to be sold or transferred does not exceed 10,000.
Material Contracts
TSMC is not currently a party to any material contract, other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of our business.
Foreign Investment in the R.O.C.
Since 1983, the R.O.C. government has periodically enacted legislation and adopted regulations to permit foreign investment in the R.O.C. securities market.
On September 30, 2003, the R.O.C. Executive Yuan approved an amendment to Regulations Governing Investment in Securities by Overseas Chinese and Foreign National, or the Regulations, which took effect on October 2, 2003. According to the Regulations, the R.O.C. FSC abolished the mechanism of the so-called “qualified foreign institutional investors” and “general foreign investors” as stipulated in the Regulations before the amendment.
Under the Regulations, foreign investors are classified as either “onshore foreign investors” or “offshore foreign investors” according to their respective geographical location. Both onshore and offshore foreign investors are allowed to invest in R.O.C. securities after they register with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The Regulations further classify foreign investors into foreign institutional investors and foreign individual investors. “Foreign institutional investors” refer to those investors incorporated and registered in accordance with foreign laws outside of the R.O.C. (i.e., offshore foreign institutional investors) or their branches set up within the R.O.C. (i.e., onshore foreign institutional investors). Offshore overseas Chinese and foreign individual investors may be subject to a maximum investment ceiling that will be separately determined by the R.O.C. FSC after consultation with the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Currently, there is no maximum investment ceiling for offshore overseas Chinese and foreign individual investors. On the other hand, foreign institutional investors are not subject to any ceiling for investment in the R.O.C. securities market.

Table of Contents
Except for certain specified industries, such as telecommunications, investments in R.O.C.-listed companies by foreign investors are not subject to individual or aggregate foreign ownership limits. Custodians for foreign investors are required to submit to the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Taiwan Stock Exchange a monthly report of trading activities and status of assets under custody and other matters. Capital remitted to the R.O.C. under these guidelines may be remitted out of the R.O.C. at any time after the date the capital is remitted to the R.O.C. Capital gains and income on investments may be remitted out of the R.O.C. at any time.
Foreign investors (other than foreign investors who have registered with the Taiwan Stock Exchange for making investments in the R.O.C. securities market) who wish to make direct investments in the shares of R.O.C. companies are required to submit a foreign investment approval application to the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or other applicable government authority. The Department of Investment Review or such other government authority reviews each foreign investment approval application and approves or disapproves each application after consultation with other governmental agencies (such as the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the R.O.C. FSC).
Under current R.O.C. law, any non-R.O.C. person possessing a foreign investment approval may repatriate annual net profits, interest and cash dividends attributable to the approved investment. Stock dividends attributable to this investment, investment capital and capital gains attributable to this investment may be repatriated by the non-R.O.C. person possessing a foreign investment approval after approvals of the Department of Investment Review or other government authorities have been obtained.
In addition to the general restriction against direct investment by non-R.O.C. persons in securities of R.O.C. companies, non-R.O.C. persons (except in certain limited cases) are currently prohibited from investing in certain industries in the R.O.C. pursuant to a “negative list”, as amended by the R.O.C. Executive Yuan. The prohibition on foreign investment in the prohibited industries specified in the negative list is absolute in the absence of a specific exemption from the application of the negative list. Pursuant to the negative list, certain other industries are restricted so that non-R.O.C. persons (except in limited cases) may invest in these industries only up to a specified level and with the specific approval of the relevant competent authority that is responsible for enforcing the relevant legislation that the negative list is intended to implement.
The R.O.C. FSC announced on April 30, 2009 the Regulations Governing Mainland Chinese Investors’ Securities Investments (“P.R.C. Regulations”) and amended the same on October 6, 2010. According to the P.R.C. Regulations, a P.R.C. qualified domestic institutional investor (“QDII”) is allowed to invest in R.O.C. securities (including less than 10% (or less in certain industries) shareholding of an R.O.C. company listed on Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange.) Nevertheless, the total investment amount of QDIIs cannot exceed US$500 million. For each QDII, the custodians of such QDIIs must apply with the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the remittance amount for each QDII, which cannot exceed US$100 million, and QDII can only invest in the R.O.C. securities market with the amount approved by the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In addition, QDIIs are currently prohibited from investing in certain industries, and their investment of certain other industries in a given company is restricted to a certain percentage pursuant to a list promulgated by the R.O.C. FSC and amended from time to time. P.R.C. investors other than QDII, however, are prohibited from making investments in an R.O.C. company listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange, unless with approval from the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs for its investment of 10% or more (or other percentage applicable to certain restricted industries) of the equity interest of such R.O.C. company.
In addition to investments permitted under the P.R.C. Regulations, P.R.C. investors who wish to make (i) direct investment in the shares of R.O.C. private companies or (ii) investments, individually or aggregately, in 10% or more (or other percentage applicable to certain restricted industries) of the equity interest of an R.O.C. company listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange are required to submit an investment approval application to the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or other government authority. The Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or such other government authority reviews investment approval application and approves or disapproves each application after consultation with other governmental agencies. Furthermore, P.R.C. investor who wishes to be elected as an R.O.C. company’s director or supervisor shall also submit an investment approval application to the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs or other government authority for approval.

Depositary Receipts
In April 1992, the R.O.C. FSC enacted regulations permitting R.O.C. companies with securities listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, with the prior approval of the R.O.C. FSC, to sponsor the issuance and sale to foreign investors of depositary receipts. Depositary receipts represent deposited shares of R.O.C. companies. In December 1994, the R.O.C. FSC allowed companies whose shares are listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or traded on the Taipei Exchange, upon approval of the R.O.C. FSC, to sponsor the issuance and sale of depositary receipts.
Our deposit agreement has been amended and restated on November 16, 2007 to: (i) make our ADSs eligible for the direct registration system, as required by the NYSE, by providing that ADSs may be certificated or uncertificated securities, (ii) enable the distribution of our reports by electronic means and (iii) reflect changes in R.O.C. laws in connection with the nomination of candidates for independent directors, for voting at the meeting of the shareholders. A copy of our amended and restated deposit agreement has been filed under the cover of Form F-6 on November 16, 2007.
A holder of depositary receipts (other than citizens of the P.R.C. and entities organized under the laws of the P.R.C. save for QDII or those which otherwise obtain the approval of the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs) may request the depositary to either cause the underlying shares to be sold in the R.O.C. and to distribute the sale proceeds to the holder or to withdraw from the depositary receipt facility the shares represented by the depositary receipts to the extent permitted under the deposit agreement (for depositary receipts representing existing shares, immediately after the issuance of the depositary receipts; and for depositary receipts representing new shares, in practice four to seven business days after the issuance of the depositary receipts) and transfer the shares to the holder.
We, or the foreign depositary bank, may not increase the number of depositary receipts by depositing shares in a depositary receipt facility or issuing additional depositary receipts against these deposits without specific R.O.C. FSC approval, except in limited circumstances. These circumstances include issuances of additional depositary receipts in connection with:
 
 
•
 
dividends or free distributions of shares;
 
 
•
 
the exercise by holders of existing depositary receipts of their pre-emptive rights in connection with capital increases for cash; or
 
 
•
 
if permitted under the deposit agreement and custody agreement, the deposit of common shares purchased by any person directly or through a depositary bank on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange (as applicable) or held by such person for deposit in the depositary receipt facility.
However, the total number of deposited shares outstanding after an issuance under the circumstances described in the third clause above may not exceed the number of deposited shares previously approved by the R.O.C. FSC plus any depositary receipts created under the circumstances described in the first two clauses above. Issuances of additional depositary receipts under the circumstances described in the third clause above will be permitted to the extent that previously issued depositary receipts have been cancelled and the underlying shares have been withdrawn from the depositary receipt facility.
Under current R.O.C. law, a non-R.O.C. holder of ADSs who withdraws and holds the underlying shares must register with the Taiwan Stock Exchange and appoint an eligible local agent to:
 
 
•
 
open a securities trading account with a local securities brokerage firm;
 
 
•
 
open an NT dollars bank account;
 
 
•
 
pay taxes;
 
 
•
 
remit funds; and
 
 
•
 
exercise rights on securities and perform other matters as may be designated by the holder.
In addition, a withdrawing non-R.O.C. holder must appoint a local custodian for handling confirmation and settlement of trades, safekeeping of securities and cash proceeds and reporting of information. Under existing R.O.C. laws and regulations, without meeting these requirements, holders of ADSs that withdraw and hold the common shares represented by the ADSs would not be able to hold or subsequently transfer the common shares, whether on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or otherwise.
 
58


Table of Contents
Holders of ADSs who are non-R.O.C. persons withdrawing common shares represented by ADSs are required under current R.O.C. law and regulations to appoint an agent in the R.O.C. for filing tax returns and making tax payments. This agent, a “tax guarantor”, must meet certain qualifications set by the R.O.C. Ministry of Finance and, upon appointment, becomes a guarantor of the withdrawing holder’s R.O.C. tax payment obligations. In addition, under current R.O.C. law, repatriation of profits by a non-R.O.C. withdrawing holder is subject to the submission of evidence of the appointment of a tax guarantor to, and approval thereof by, the tax authority, or submission of tax clearance certificates or submission of evidencing documents issued by such agent (so long as the capital gains from securities transactions are exempt from R.O.C. income tax).
Under existing R.O.C. laws and regulations relating to foreign exchange control, a depositary may, without obtaining further approvals from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) or any other governmental authority or agency of the R.O.C., convert NT dollars into other currencies, including U.S. dollars, in respect of the following: proceeds of the sale of shares represented by depositary receipts, proceeds of the sale of shares received as stock dividends and deposited into the depositary receipt facility and any cash dividends or cash distributions received. In addition, a depositary, also without any of these approvals, may convert inward remittances of payments into NT dollars for purchases of underlying shares for deposit into the depositary receipt facility against the creation of additional depositary receipts. A depositary may be required to obtain foreign exchange approval from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) on a payment-by-payment basis for conversion from NT dollars into other currencies relating to the sale of subscription rights for new shares. Proceeds from the sale of any underlying shares by holders of depositary receipts withdrawn from the depositary receipt facility may be converted into other currencies without obtaining approval from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Proceeds from the sale of the underlying shares withdrawn from the depositary receipt facility may be used for reinvestment in the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Direct Share Offerings
Since 1997, the R.O.C. government has amended regulations to permit R.O.C. companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange to issue shares directly (not through depositary receipt facility) overseas.
Overseas Corporate Bonds
Since 1989, the R.O.C. FSC has approved a series of overseas corporate bonds issued by R.O.C. companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taipei Exchange in offerings outside the R.O.C. Under current R.O.C. law, these overseas corporate bonds can be:
 
 
•
 
converted by bondholders, other than citizens of the P.R.C. and entities organized under the laws of the P.R.C. save for QDII or those that have obtained the approval of the Department of Investment Review of the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs, into shares of R.O.C. companies; or
 
 
•
 
subject to R.O.C. FSC approval, converted into depositary receipts issued by the same R.O.C. company or by the issuing company of the exchange shares, in the case of exchangeable bonds.
The relevant regulations also permit public companies to issue corporate debt in offerings outside the R.O.C. Proceeds from the sale of the shares converted from overseas convertible bonds may be used for reinvestment in securities listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or traded on the Taipei Exchange, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Exchange Controls in the R.O.C.
The R.O.C. Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the R.O.C. FSC and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, and all foreign currency needed for the importation of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
Trade aside, R.O.C. companies and resident individuals may, without foreign exchange approval, remit to and from the R.O.C. foreign currency of up to US$100 million or its equivalent (or such other amount as determined by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from time to time at its discretion in consideration of the R.O.C.’s economic and financial conditions or the need to maintain the order of the foreign exchange market in the R.O.C.) and US$10 million or its equivalent (or such other amount as determined by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from time to time at its discretion in consideration of the R.O.C.’s economic and financial conditions or the needs to maintain the order of the foreign exchange market in the R.O.C.), respectively, in each calendar year. Furthermore, any remittance of foreign currency into the R.O.C. by a R.O.C. company or resident individual in a year will be offset by the amount remitted out of R.O.C. by such company or individual (as applicable) within its annual quota and will not use up its annual inward remittance quota to the extent of such offset. The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion of NT dollars to a foreign currency and vice versa. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises incorporated or registered in the R.O.C. to register their medium- and long-term foreign debts with the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan).
 
59


Table of Contents
In addition, foreign persons may, subject to certain requirements, but without foreign exchange approval of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), remit outside and into the R.O.C. foreign currencies of up to US$100,000 (or its equivalent) for each remittance. The above limit applies to remittances involving a conversion of NT dollars to a foreign currency and vice versa. The above limit does not, however, apply to the conversion of NT dollars into other currencies, including U.S. dollars, in respect of the proceeds of sale of any underlying shares withdrawn from a depositary receipt facility.
Voting of Deposited Securities
Holders may direct the exercise of voting rights with respect to the common shares represented by the ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement as described below and applicable R.O.C. law. See “Item 3. Key Information – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Ownership of ADSs – Your voting rights as a holder of ADSs will be limited”.
Except as described below, the holders will not be able to exercise the voting rights attaching to the common shares represented by the ADSs on an individual basis. According to provisions of the deposit agreement, the voting rights attaching to the common shares represented by ADSs must be exercised as to all matters subject to a vote of shareholders by the depositary bank or its nominee, who represents all holders of ADSs, collectively in the same manner, except in the case of an election of directors. Directors are elected by cumulative voting unless our Articles of Incorporation stipulate otherwise.
In the deposit agreement, the holders will appoint the depositary bank as their representative to exercise the voting rights with respect to the common shares represented by the ADSs.
We will provide the depositary bank with copies (including English translations) of notices of meetings of our shareholders and the agenda of these meetings, including a list of the director candidates, if an election of directors is to be held at the meeting. The depositary bank will mail these materials, together with a voting instruction form to holders as soon as practicable after the depositary bank receives the materials from us. In order to validly exercise its voting rights, the holder of ADSs must complete, sign and return to the depositary bank the voting instruction form by a date specified by the depositary bank.
Subject to the provisions described in the second succeeding paragraph, which will apply to the election of directors done by means of cumulative voting, if persons together holding at least 51% of the ADSs outstanding at the relevant record date instruct the depositary bank to vote in the same manner in respect of one or more resolutions to be proposed at the meeting (other than the election of directors), the depositary bank will notify the instructions to the chairman of our board of directors or a person he may designate. The depositary bank will appoint the chairman or his designated person to serve as the voting representative of the depositary bank or its nominee and the holders. The voting representative will attend such meeting and vote all the common shares represented by ADSs to be voted in the manner so instructed by such holders in relation to such resolution or resolutions.
If, for any reason, the depositary bank has not by the date specified by it received instructions from persons together holding at least 51% of all the ADSs outstanding at the relevant record date to vote in the same manner in respect of any resolution specified in the agenda for the meeting (other than the election of directors), then the holders will be deemed to have instructed the depositary bank or its nominee to authorize and appoint the voting representative as the representative of the depositary bank and the holders to attend such meeting and vote all the common shares represented by all ADSs as the voting representative deems appropriate with respect to such resolution or resolutions, which may not be in your interests; provided, however, that the depositary bank or its nominee will not give any such authorization and appointment unless it has received an opinion of R.O.C. counsel addressed to the depositary bank and in form and substance satisfactory to the depositary bank, at its sole expense, to the effect that, under R.O.C. law (i) the deposit agreement is valid, binding and enforceable against us and the holders and (ii) the depositary bank will not be deemed to be authorized to exercise any discretion when voting in accordance with the deposit agreement and will not be subject to any potential liability for losses arising from such voting. We and the depositary bank will take such actions, including amendment of the provisions of the deposit agreement relating to voting of common shares, as we deem appropriate to endeavor to provide for the exercise of voting rights attached to the common shares represented by all ADSs at shareholders’ meetings in a manner consistent with applicable R.O.C. law.
The depositary bank will notify the voting representative of the instructions for the election of directors received from holders and appoint the voting representative as the representative of the depositary bank and the holders to attend such meeting and vote the common shares represented by ADSs as to which the depositary bank has received instructions from holders for the election of directors, subject to any restrictions imposed by R.O.C. law and our Articles of Incorporation. Holders who by the date specified by the depositary bank have not delivered instructions to the depositary bank will be deemed to have instructed the depositary bank to authorize and appoint the voting representative as the representative of the depositary bank or its nominee and the holders to attend such meeting and vote all the common shares represented by ADSs as to which the depositary bank has not received instructions from the holders for the election of directors as the voting representative deems appropriate, which may not be in your best interests. Candidates standing for election as representatives of a shareholder may be replaced by such shareholder prior to the meeting of the shareholders, and the votes cast by the holders for such candidates shall be counted as votes for their replacements.

Table of Contents
By accepting and continuing to hold ADSs or any interest therein, the holders will be deemed to have agreed to the voting provisions set forth in the deposit agreement, as such provisions may be amended from time to time to comply with applicable R.O.C. law.
There can be no assurance that the holders will receive notice of shareholders’ meetings sufficiently prior to the date established by the depositary bank for receipt of instructions to enable you to give voting instructions before the cutoff date.
Moreover, in accordance with the deposit agreement, as further amended and restated as of November 16, 2007 and pursuant to R.O.C. Company Act, holders that individually or together with other holders hold at least 51% of the ADSs outstanding at the relevant record date are entitled to submit each year one written proposal for voting at the general meeting of shareholders; provided, that (i) such proposal is in Chinese language and does not exceed 300 Chinese characters, (ii) such proposal is submitted to the depositary bank at least two business days prior to the expiry of the relevant submission period, which shall be publicly announced by us each year in a report on Form 6-K filed with the U.S. SEC prior to the commencement of the 60 days closed period for general meetings of shareholders, (iii) such proposal is accompanied by a written certificate to the depositary bank, in the form required by the depository bank, certifying that such proposal is being submitted by holders that individually or together with other holders hold at least 51% of the ADSs outstanding at the date of the submission and, if the date of the submission is on or after the relevant record date, also certifying that the holders who submitted the proposal held at least 51% of the ADSs outstanding as of the relevant record date, (iv) if the date of the submission is prior to the relevant record date, the holders who submitted the proposal must also provide, within five business days after the relevant record date, a second written certificate to the depositary bank, in the form required by the depositary bank, certifying that the holders who submitted the proposal continued to hold at least 51% of the ADSs outstanding at the relevant record date, (v) such proposal is accompanied by a joint and several irrevocable undertaking of all submitting holders to pay all fees and expenses incurred in relation to the submission (including the costs and expenses of the depositary bank or its agent to attend the general meeting of the shareholders) as such fees and expenses may be reasonably determined and documented by the depositary bank or us, and (vi) such proposal shall only be voted upon at the general meeting of shareholders if such proposal is accepted by our board of directors as eligible in accordance with applicable law for consideration at a shareholders meeting.
Taxation
R.O.C. Taxation
The following is a general summary of the principal R.O.C. tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of ADSs or common shares by and to a non-resident individual or entity. It applies only to a holder that is:
 
 
•
 
an individual who is not an R.O.C. citizen, who owns ADSs and who is not physically present in the R.O.C. for 183 days or more during any calendar year; or
 
 
•
 
a corporation or a non-corporate body that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the R.O.C. and has no fixed place of business or business agent in the R.O.C.
Holders of ADSs should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular R.O.C. tax consequences of owning the ADSs which may affect them.
Dividends. Effective from 2018, dividends declared by us out of our retained earnings and distributed to the holders are subject to R.O.C. withholding tax at 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash dividends or on the par value of the common shares in the case of stock dividends unless a lower withholding rate is provided under a tax treaty between the R.O.C. and the jurisdiction where the holders are residents. Starting 2019, no retained earnings tax paid can offset as a credit against the 21% withholding tax.
Distribution of common shares or cash out of our capital reserves is not subject to R.O.C. withholding tax, except under limited circumstances.
Capital Gains. Starting from January 1, 2016, capital gains realized from the sale or disposal of the common shares are exempt from R.O.C. income tax under Article 4-1 of the R.O.C. Income Tax Act.
Sales of ADSs are not regarded as sales of R.O.C. securities and thus any gains derived from transfers of ADSs are not regarded as R.O.C.-sourced income. Accordingly, any gains derived from transfers of ADSs by holders are not currently subject to R.O.C. income tax.
 
61


Table of Contents
Subscription Rights. Distributions of statutory subscription rights for common shares in compliance with R.O.C. law are not subject to any R.O.C. tax. Proceeds derived from sales of statutory subscription rights evidenced by securities are subject to securities transaction tax at the rate of 0.3% of the gross amount received. Holders are exempt from income tax on capital gains from the sale of statutory subscription rights evidenced by securities. Proceeds derived from sales of statutory subscription rights not evidenced by securities are not subject to securities transaction tax but the capital gains are subject to R.O.C. income tax at a fixed rate of 20%.
Subject to compliance with R.O.C. law, we, at our sole discretion, can determine whether statutory subscription rights shall be evidenced by issuance of securities.
Securities Transaction Tax. A securities transaction tax, at the rate of 0.3% of the sales proceeds, will be withheld upon a sale of common shares in the R.O.C. Transfers of ADSs are not subject to R.O.C. securities transaction tax. Withdrawal of common shares from the deposit facility is not subject to R.O.C. securities transaction tax.
Estate and Gift Tax. R.O.C. estate tax is payable on any property within the R.O.C. left by a deceased, and R.O.C. gift tax is payable on any property within the R.O.C. donated by an individual. Estate tax and gift tax are currently payable at the progressive rates of 10%, 15% and 20%. Under R.O.C. estate and gift tax laws, common shares issued by R.O.C. companies are deemed located in the R.O.C. regardless of the location of the holder. It is unclear whether a holder of ADSs will be considered to hold common shares for this purpose.
Tax Treaty. The R.O.C. does not have a double taxation treaty with the United States. On the other hand, the R.O.C. has double taxation treaties with Indonesia, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Malaysia, North Macedonia, Israel, Gambia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Senegal, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Paraguay, Hungary, France, Eswatini, India, Slovakia, Switzerland, Germany, Thailand, Luxembourg, Kiribati, Austria, Italy, Japan, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, which may limit the rate of R.O.C. withholding tax on dividends paid with respect to common shares in R.O.C. companies. The ADS holders may or may not be considered to hold common shares for the purposes of these treaties. The holders should consult their tax advisors concerning their eligibility for the benefits with respect to the ADSs.
United States Federal Income Taxation
This section discusses the material United States federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of our common shares or ADSs. It applies to you only if you hold your common shares or ADSs as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only United States federal income taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including:
 
 
•
 
dealers or traders in securities or foreign currencies;
 
 
•
 
banks and certain other financial institutions;
 
 
•
 
brokers;
 
 
•
 
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;
 
 
•
 
tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts;
 
 
•
 
life insurance companies;
 
 
•
 
persons that actually or constructively own 10% or more of the combined voting power of our voting stock or of the total value of our stock;

•
 
persons that hold common shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion or integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes;
 
 
•
 
persons that purchases or sells common shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes;
 
 
•
 
persons who are former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, or
 
 
•
 
U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
This section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed Treasury regulations, and published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this section is based in part upon the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. In general, for United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those ADSs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.
You are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs and you are, for United States federal income tax purposes:
 
 
•
 
a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
 
•
 
a United States domestic corporation, or other entity subject to United States federal income tax as a domestic corporation;
 
 
•
 
an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or
 
 
•
 
a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United States persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs that is not a United States person and is not a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of the common shares or ADSs, the United States tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A holder of the common shares or ADSs that is a partnership and partners in such a partnership should consult their own tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of common shares or ADSs.
The tax treatment of your common shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”), for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under “—PFIC Rules”, this discussion assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.
You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local income tax and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of common shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.
U.S. Holders
Taxation of Distributions
If you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any distribution we pay in respect of your common shares or ADSs out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distributions of our common shares, including the amount of any R.O.C. tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. Because we do not expect to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. holder should expect that any distribution made by us to such holder will generally be treated as a dividend. If you are a noncorporate U.S. holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that you hold our common shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to the ADSs will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on the NYSE or another established securities market in the United States. Our ADSs are listed on the NYSE, and we therefore expect that dividends we pay with respect to the ADSs will be qualified dividend income. It is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the common shares will be qualified dividend income.
 
63


Table of Contents
The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of common shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend actually or constructively. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of dividends received from other United States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income will be the U.S. dollar value of the NT dollar payments made, determined at the spot NT dollar/U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date of the dividend distribution to the date the payment is converted into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
Subject to generally applicable limitations and restrictions, it is possible that the R.O.C. taxes withheld from dividend distributions and paid over to the R.O.C. would be eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Dividends will generally be income from sources outside the United States. Dividends will generally be “passive” income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you. The rules applicable to the United States foreign tax credit are complex, and you should consult your own tax adviser concerning the availability of the credit in your particular circumstances.
Pro rata distributions of common shares by us to holders of common shares or ADSs may not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, such distributions may not give rise to taxable foreign-source income against which the R.O.C. tax imposed on such distributions may be credited.
Taxation of Capital Gains
If you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your common shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your common shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a noncorporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held more than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations.
PFIC Rules
We believe that our common shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually, and thus may be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will not be considered by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to be a PFIC in current or future years.
In general, if you are a U.S. holder, we will be a PFIC with respect to you if for any taxable year in which you held our common shares or ADSs:
 
 
•
 
at least 75% of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or
 
 
•
 
at least 50% of the value, determined on the basis of a quarterly average, of our assets in such taxable year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.
“Passive income” generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents (other than certain rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business), annuities and gains from assets that produce passive income and certain other specified categories of income. If a foreign corporation owns directly or indirectly at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the foreign corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation, and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation’s income.
If we are treated as a PFIC, and you are a U.S. holder that does not make a mark-to-market election, as described below, you will be subject to special rules with respect to:
 
 
•
 
any gain you realize on the sale or other disposition of your common shares or ADSs; and
 
64


Table of Contents
 
•
 
any excess distribution that we make to you (generally, any distributions to you during a single taxable year, other than the taxable year in which your holding period in the common shares or ADSs begin, that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by you in respect of the common shares or ADSs during the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the portion of your holding period for the common shares or ADSs that preceded the taxable year in which you receive the distribution).
Under these rules:
 
 
•
 
the gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the common shares or ADSs,
 
 
•
 
the amount allocated to the taxable year in which you realized the gain or excess distribution will be taxed as ordinary income,
 
 
•
 
the amount allocated to each prior year, with certain exceptions, will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year, and
 
 
•
 
the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such year.
Special rules apply for calculating the amount of the foreign tax credit with respect to excess distributions by a PFIC.
If you own common shares or ADSs in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, you may make a mark-to-market election. If you make this election, you will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above. Instead, in general, you will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of your common shares or ADSs at the end of the taxable year over your tax basis in your common shares or ADSs. These amounts of ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. You will also be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the tax basis of your common shares or ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your tax basis in the common shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. Your gain, if any, recognized upon the sale of your common shares or ADSs will be taxed as ordinary income.
Also, where a company that is a PFIC meets certain reporting requirements, a U.S. holder could avoid certain adverse PFIC consequences described herein by making a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election to be taxed currently on its proportionate share of the PFIC’s ordinary income and net capital gains. U.S. holders will not be able to treat a company as a QEF if the company does not prepare the information that U.S. holders would need to make a QEF election. We do not intend to prepare or provide the information that would enable U.S. holders to make a QEF election.
In addition, notwithstanding any election you make with regard to the common shares or ADSs, dividends that you receive from us will not constitute qualified dividend income to you if we are a PFIC (or are treated as a PFIC with respect to you) either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year. Moreover, your common shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your common shares or ADSs, even if we are not currently a PFIC. For purposes of this rule, if you make a mark-to-market election with respect to your common shares or ADSs, you will be treated as having a new holding period in your common shares or ADSs beginning on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after the last taxable year for which the mark-to-market election applies. Dividends that you receive that do not constitute qualified dividend income are not eligible for taxation at the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Instead, you must include the gross amount of any such dividend paid by us out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) in your gross income, and it will be subject to tax at rates applicable to ordinary income as well as the special rules provided with respect to excess distributions, if applicable, as described above.
If you own common shares or ADSs during any year that we are a PFIC with respect to you, you generally must file IRS Form 8621.
The rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above, including our ownership of any non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result, U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the PFIC rules.

Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets
U.S. holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 may be required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. “Specified foreign financial assets” may include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-U.S. persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for investment that have non-U.S. issuers or counterparties and (iii) interests in foreign entities. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their ownership of common shares or ADSs.
Non-U.S. Holders
Except as described in the section titled “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on the payment of dividends and the proceeds from the disposition of common shares or ADSs unless: such item is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States and, in the case of a resident of a country which has a treaty with the United States and is eligible for the benefits of the treaty with the United States, such item is attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed place of business, in the United States; or the non-U.S. holder is an individual who holds the common shares or ADSs as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, certain other conditions are met, and such non-U.S. holder does not qualify for an exemption. If the first exception applies, the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such item in the same manner as a U.S. holder unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty; a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits tax with respect to such item at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty). If the second exception applies, the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount by which such non-U.S. holder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of disposition of the common shares or ADSs.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
U.S. holders generally are subject to information reporting requirements, on IRS Form 1099, with respect to dividends paid on common shares or ADSs and on the proceeds from the sale, exchange or disposition of common shares or ADSs unless the holder is a corporation or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption. In addition, U.S. holders are subject to back-up withholding on dividends paid on common shares or ADSs, and on the sale, exchange or other disposition of common shares or ADSs, unless each such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number and a duly executed IRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Non-U.S. holders generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding with respect to dividends, or the proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of common shares or ADSs, provided that each such non-U.S. holder certifies as to its foreign status on the applicable duly executed IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. holder’s or non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Documents on Display
The U.S. SEC maintains a website www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding registrants, including the Company, that file electronically with the U.S. SEC.

ITEM 11.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS
We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.
Foreign Currency Risk: Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars.
 
66


Table of Contents
We use foreign currency derivatives contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, net investments in foreign subsidiaries, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our total monetary assets and liabilities, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 would have decreased our net income by NT$891 million and NT$1,906 million (US$58 million) in 2023 and 2024 respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions. For further information, please refer to note 8, note 11 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Risks: We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on our debt.
The objective of our investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires us to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The majority of our fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in asset values unless the assets are sold.
Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our fixed income investments, a hypothetical adverse interest rate change of 100 basis points across all maturities would have decreased our other comprehensive income by NT$3,842 million and NT$4,501 million (US$137 million) in 2023 and 2024, respectively, after taking into account interest rate hedges. For further information, please refer to note 9, note 10, note 11 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
The majority of our debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount. For further information, please refer to note 18, note 19 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
We have entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on our fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.
Inflation Risk: We are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of items such as raw materials and equipment used to produce our products, wage expenses and employee benefits, electricity costs, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of our products and services do not increase with these increased costs.
Other Market Risk: Our equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce the fair value of our holdings. We currently do not reduce our equity market exposure through hedging activities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we had investments in private equity securities mostly through a number of investment funds with a carrying value of NT$7,209 million and NT$7,823 million (US$239 million), respectively. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our equity investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical adverse price change of 10% would have decreased our other comprehensive income by approximately NT$955 million and NT$1,013 million (US$31 million) in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The actual disposal value of these investments may be significantly different from their carrying value. For further information, please refer to note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Pursuant to Rule 13(a)-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
As of the end of 2024, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, independently assessed the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche has issued an attestation report, which is included at the end of this Item 15.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During 2024, there was no material change to our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated April 17, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

FSC.
Audit Related Fees. This category consists of assurance and related services by the Deloitte Entities that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported above under “Audit Fees.” The services for the fees disclosed under this category were related to corporate bonds offering and such fees were borne by the underwriter.
Tax Fees. This category consists of professional services rendered by the Deloitte Entities for tax compliance and tax advice.
All Other Fees. This category consists of related services for the issuance of shares arising from restricted share awards and employee stock options and research tool for accounting standards and regulations.
Our policy and procedures require all services performed by Deloitte & Touche to be pre-approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.

PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS
On June 5, 2024, our Board of Directors resolved to approve the buyback and subsequent cancellation of up to 3,249,000 of our common shares over the period from June 6, 2024 to August 5, 2024 (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”). The purpose of the 2024 Share Repurchase Program was to offset the dilutive effect of the issuance of RSAs under our equity incentive plans (see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees— Employee Restricted Stock Awards Rules for Years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024” for a further discussion). Between June 14, 2024 and June 28, 2024, we bought back an aggregate of 3,249,000 common shares for an aggregate purchase amount of approximately NT$3,089 million (US$94 million), which represents an average purchase price of approximately NT$951 per share. The treasury stocks of 3,249,000 shares were all cancelled on September 1, 2024.
The table below sets forth certain information related to purchases made by us of our common shares in the periods indicated.

ITEM 16G.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
TSMC’s corporate governance practices are governed by applicable Taiwan law, specifically, the R.O.C. Company Act and R.O.C. Securities and Exchange Act, and also TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation. Also, because TSMC securities are registered with the U.S. SEC and are listed on the NYSE, TSMC is subject to corporate governance requirements applicable to NYSE-listed foreign private issuers.
Under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, NYSE-listed non-US companies may, in general, follow their home country corporate governance practices in lieu of most of the new NYSE corporate governance requirements. However, all NYSE-listed foreign private issuers must comply with NYSE Sections 303A.06, 303A.11, 303A.12(b), 303A.12(c) and 303A.14.
Item 16G as well as NYSE Section 303A.11 requires that foreign private issuers disclose any significant ways in which their corporate governance practices differ from US companies under NYSE listing standards. This requirement is not intended to suggest that one country’s corporate governance practices are better or more effective than another. A NYSE-listed foreign private issuer is required to provide to its US investors, a brief, general summary of the significant differences, either: (a) on the company website in English, or (b) in its annual report distributed to its US investors. To comply with NYSE Section 303A.11, TSMC has prepared the comparison in the table below.
The most relevant differences between TSMC corporate governance practices and NYSE standards for listed companies are as follows:
 



NYSE Standards for US Companies
under Listed Company Manual
Section 303A
  
TSMC Corporate Practices
NYSE Section 303A.01 requires a NYSE-listed company to have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors.
  
Taiwan law does not require a board of directors of publicly traded companies to consist of a majority of independent directors. Taiwan law requires public companies meeting certain criteria to have at least three independent directors but no less than one fifth of the total number of directors on its board of directors. Starting from 2024, public companies that meet certain criteria are required to have a minimum of one-third of their directors serving as independent directors. In addition, Taiwan law requires public companies to disclose information pertaining to their directors, including their independence status. Please see TSMC’s annual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year filed with the Taiwan authorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are available online at www.tsmc.com) for information on the total number of TSMC directors and directors who would be considered independent under NYSE Section 303A.02 and Taiwan law.
 
73


Table of Contents



 
 
NYSE Section 303A.02 establishes general standards to evaluate directors’ independence (no director qualifies as independent unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the listed company).
  
Taiwan law establishes comparable standards to evaluate director independence. For further information, please consult TSMC’s Taiwan annual report for the relevant year.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.03 requires non-management directors to meet at regularly scheduled executive meetings that are not attended by management.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such a requirement. Except for meetings of sub-committees of the board of directors and those held by managing directors, Taiwan law does not allow separate board meetings of part but not all of the board of directors.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.04 requires listed companies to have a nominating/corporate governance committee comprised entirely of independent directors which committee shall have a written charter establishing certain minimum responsibilities as set forth in NYSE Section 303A.04(b)(i) and providing for an annual evaluation of the committee’s performance.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such a requirement. Pursuant to Taiwan law, TSMC’s directors must be nominated either by the shareholders or by the entire board of directors. TSMC, however, has established a Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee in February 2023 to assist our Board of Directors mainly in selecting candidates for nomination to be elected as independent directors to the Board and advising on corporate governance and sustainability matters. The Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, by its charter, shall be composed of the Chairman of the Board and three to six independent directors.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.05(a) requires listed companies to have a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors.
  
Taiwan law requires certain public companies, such as us, to establish a compensation committee by September 30, 2011. TSMC, however, has established its Compensation Committee since 2003 (renamed as “Compensation and People Development Committee” effective as of February 14, 2023), which has met the requirements under the Taiwan law. Taiwan law permits a non-director independent member, appointed by the board of directors, to serve as a member on the compensation committee, so long as such member meets the independent and other requirements under the relevant Taiwan law. Also, as required by the TWSE, the compensation committee of the companies listed on the TWSE must consist of a majority of independent directors, and all the members of the compensation committee shall elect an independent director to act as the convener and the chairperson of the meeting. Please see TSMC’s annual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year filed with the Taiwan authorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are available online at www.tsmc.com) for further information regarding the composition and functions of its compensation committee.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.05(b) requires a compensation committee’s charter to establish certain minimum responsibilities and to provide for an annual evaluation of the committee’s performance.
  
Taiwan law requires certain public companies, such as us, to establish a compensation committee by September 30, 2011. TSMC, however, has established its Compensation Committee since 2003, which has met the requirements under the Taiwan law, and TSMC’s Compensation and People Development Committee charter contains the same responsibilities as those provided under NYSE Section 303A.05(b)(i) and mandates the committee to review the adequacy of its charter annually.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.06 requires listed companies to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Foreign private issuers must satisfy the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act by July 31, 2005.
  
TSMC voluntarily established its Audit Committee (renamed as “Audit and Risk Committee” effective as of February 14, 2023) before the promulgation of related Taiwan law. Our Audit and Risk Committee fully complies with both local law requirements and corporate governance standards. Please see TSMC’s annual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year filed with the Taiwan authorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are available online at www.tsmc.com) for further information regarding the composition of its audit committee. TSMC’s Audit and Risk Committee members are all independent directors satisfying requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.

Table of Contents



 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(a) requires an audit committee to consist of at least three board members. All of its members shall be financially literate or must acquire such financial knowledge within a reasonable period and at least one of its members shall have experience in accounting or financial administration.
  
Taiwan law requires all independent directors of a public company to be members of the audit committee if the company has established such a committee of which at least one shall have accounting or financial expertise. Please see TSMC’s annual report and Form 20-F for the relevant year filed with the Taiwan authorities and the U.S. SEC (both of which are available online at www.tsmc.com) for further information regarding the composition of its audit committee. TSMC’s Audit and Risk Committee members are all financially literate and are assisted by a financial expert consultant.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(a) requires that if an audit committee member is simultaneously a member of the audit committee of more than three public companies, and the listed company does not limit the number of audit committees on which its members may serve, then, in each case the board of that company shall determine whether the simultaneous service would prevent such member from effectively serving on the listed company’s audit committee, and shall report its decision in the annual proxy statement of the company or in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. SEC.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such requirement. Taiwan law requires all independent directors of a public company to be members of the audit committee if the company has established such a committee. Taiwan law forbids an independent director from serving as an independent director on a total of more than four Taiwan public companies.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(a) requires all members of the audit committee to be independent.
  
Taiwan law requires all independent directors of a public company to be members of the audit committee if the company has established such a committee.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(b) requires an audit committee to have a written charter establishing the duties and responsibilities of its members, including the duties and responsibilities required, at a minimum, by Rule 10A-3(b)(2), (3), (4) & (5) of the Exchange Act.
  
Taiwan law requires comparable standards. TSMC currently has a written Audit and Risk Committee charter containing the same duties and responsibilities as those provided under Section 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(b)(iii)(B) and (C) establishes audit committee objectives: (i) to discuss the annual audited financial statements and the quarterly financial statements of the company with management and the independent auditor, including the information disclosed under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”; and (ii) to discuss the company’s press releases relating to its earnings as well as the financial information and guidelines relating to its earnings that are supplied to analysts and rating agencies.
  
TSMC’s written Audit and Risk Committee charter establishes the same audit committee objectives.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(b)(iii)(G) requires an audit committee to establish clear policies for hiring external auditor’s employees.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such requirement.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.07(c) requires each company to have an internal audit function that provides to the management and to the audit committee ongoing assessments on the company’s risk management processes and internal control system.
  
Taiwan law requires public companies to establish an internal audit function. Internal auditors are subject to strict qualification standards under Taiwan law, which require the board of directors to approve the appointment of the head of a company’s internal audit function. TSMC’s internal audit function has substantially the same responsibilities as provided under NYSE Section 303A.07(d).

Table of Contents



 
 
NYSE Section 303A.08 requires each company to give to shareholders the opportunity to vote on all equity based compensation plans and material revisions thereto with certain exceptions.
  
Taiwan law imposes a similar requirement. Employee stock option plans (“ESOPs”) are required to be approved by the board of directors. Shareholders’ approval is not required if the number of options granted under the relevant ESOP does not exceed the reservation made in TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation and if the exercise price is not below the price as determined by relevant regulations. Otherwise, any change to such reservation in the Articles requires shareholders’ approval. Employee restricted stock awards are required to be approved by the board of directors and the shareholders’ meeting with a quorum of holders of at least two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock at which the holders of at least a majority of the common stock represented at the meeting vote in favor thereof. However, in the case of a publicly held company such as TSMC, such a resolution by the shareholders’ meeting may be adopted by the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock represented at a shareholders’ meeting at which holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock are present. TSMC currently has three equity-based compensation plans in effect, which were approved by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, February 14, 2023 and February 6, 2024, and by the shareholders on June 8, 2022, June 6, 2023 and June 4, 2024, respectively.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.09 requires public companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines, including several issues for which such reporting is mandatory, and to include such information on the company’s website (which website should also include the charters of the audit committee, the nominating committee, and the compensation committee.)
  
Taiwan law does not contain such requirement. TSMC, however, voluntarily adopted corporate governance guidelines in May 2023, and discloses such guidelines at www.tsmc.com.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.09 requires the board of directors to make a self-assessment of its performance at least once a year to determine if it or its committees function effectively and report thereon.
  
Starting from 2020, companies listed on the TWSE are required by TWSE’s new rule to conduct self-assessment or peer assessment on the performance of the board of directors and each director every year and to submit the assessment results to TWSE by the end of the first quarter of the next year. TSMC has been conducting annual self-assessment on its Audit and Risk Committee’s performance since 2011 and on its Board of Directors as well as each director since 2020 in compliance with TWSE’s requirements. Starting from 2023, TSMC also conducts annual assessment on all its Board committees, including the Audit and Risk Committee, Compensation and People Development Committee, and Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.10 provides for the adoption of a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and sets out the topics that such code must contain.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such requirement. But, because of sound corporate governance principles, TSMC has adopted an “Ethics and Business Conduct Policy”, which complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s requirements concerning financial officers and CEO accountability.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.12(a) requires the CEO, on a yearly basis, to certify to the NYSE that he or she knows of no violation by the company of NYSE rules relating to corporate governance.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such a requirement. But, in order to comply with relevant U.S. SEC regulations, TSMC’s CEO is required to certify in TSMC’s 20-F annual report that, to his or her knowledge the information contained therein fairly represents in all material respects the financial condition and results of operation of TSMC.
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.12(b) requires the CEO to notify the NYSE in writing whenever any executive officer of the company becomes aware of any substantial non-fulfillment of any applicable provision under NYSE Section 303A.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such requirement. But, in order to be consistent with the corporate governance principles established under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, TSMC’s CEO complies with the notice provision as set forth under NYSE Section 303A.12(b).
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.12(c) requires each listed company to submit an executed Written Affirmation annually to the NYSE and Interim Written Affirmation each time a specified change occurs in the board or any of the committees subject to Section 303A.
  
Taiwan law does not contain such requirement. But, in order to comply with the corporate governance principles established under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, TSMC complies with NYSE Section 303A.12(c).
 
 
NYSE Section 303A.14 requires each listed company to adopt a policy for the recovery of excess incentive-based compensation earned by current or former executive officers.
  
In compliance with NYSE Section 303A.14, TSMC adopted the TSMC Clawback Policy in August 2023, available on TSMC’s website.

CYBERSECURITY

Our Audit and Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, including reviewing periodic reports from the head of Global Security Management function relating to our information technology and security matters, including any cybersecurity incidents, assessment of new and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats and their proposed improvement measures. Based on such reviews and their discussions with the head of Global Security Management function, our Audit and Risk Committee assists our Board to review, assess, and enhance the adequacy and effectiveness of our cybersecurity policies and procedures on an ongoing basis.
The head of our Global Security Management function assesses and manages the cybersecurity risk and reports to the Audit and Risk Committee. Our head of Global Security Management function has over 30 years of experience in cybersecurity and other professionals in our Global Security Management function have cybersecurity experiences or certifications. Our Global Security Management function regularly assesses the threat landscape and takes a holistic view of cybersecurity risks. We have implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to assess, identify and manage cybersecurity risks and to prevent and minimize harm caused by cybersecurity attacks. Such measures mainly include:
 
 
•
 
building a defense shield on the cloud that includes adopting advanced cloud solution against distributed denial-of-service (“DDoS”) attacks, implementing domain name system (“DNS”) service on secure cloud platform, securing internet access by cloud solution, and enhancing phishing mail defense;

 
 
•
 
certifying office computer security compliance and installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers and servers;

 
 
•
 
enhancing data center security by sunsetting insecure protocols, conducting network port security scans and enhancing server security hardening;

 
 
•
 
reviewing and enhancing fab and facility zone security controls;

 
 
•
 
improving software security by implementing security scanning and conducting effective vulnerability management and penetration tests; and

 
 
•
 
enhancing internal security assessment automation and conducting external red team testing and practicing responses to ransomware attacks.

To reduce supply chain risks, we collaborate with major suppliers to improve their security measures, share industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule and conduct supplier security onsite audit. In 2024, we organized a cybersecurity workshop for suppliers, sharing network security defense solutions and practices. Nearly 800 participants from close to 500 suppliers attended the workshop, which received high recognition from the suppliers. Moreover, we have collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (“SEMI”) to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. We also joined Semiconductor Manufacturing Cybersecurity Consortium (“SMCC”), which focuses on important cybersecurity topics and seeks to find solutions that will benefit the entire industry. Also, as we employ certain third-party service providers to help us and our affiliates worldwide conduct risk assessment, security defense testing and vulnerability scanning, we require such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in our service agreements.
To our knowledge, as of the date of this annual report, there is no material risk from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operation or financial condition.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (a Republic of China corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Our audits also comprehended the translation of New Taiwan dollar amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Such U.S. dollar amounts are presented solely for the convenience of the readers outside the Republic of China.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April 17, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and risk committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) - commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as equipment under installation and construction in progress (EUI/CIP) - Refer to Notes 5, 6, and 15
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.
Given the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:
 
1.
We read the Company’s policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.
 
2.
We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.
 
3.
We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:
 
 
a.
Evaluated whether the selection did not meet the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation.
 
 
b.
Observed the assets and evaluated their status.
 
4.
We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.
 
5.
We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.

1.
GENERAL
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), a Republic of China (R.O.C.) corporation, was incorporated on February 21, 1987. TSMC is a dedicated foundry in the semiconductor industry which engages mainly in the manufacturing, sales, packaging, testing and computer-aided design of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices and the manufacturing of masks.
On September 5, 1994, TSMC’s shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). On October 8, 1997, TSMC listed some of its shares of stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs).
The address of its registered office and principal place of business is No. 8, Li-Hsin Rd. 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan. The principal operating activities of TSMC’s subsidiaries are described in Note 5.
 
2.
THE AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the management on April 17, 2025.
 
3.
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS
TSMC and its subsidiaries (collectively as the “Company”) maintain its accounts and express its consolidated financial statements in New Taiwan dollars. For convenience only, U.S. dollar amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated from New Taiwan dollars at the exchange rate as set forth in the statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States, which was NT$32.79 to US$1.00 as of December 31, 2024. The convenience translations should not be construed as representations that the New Taiwan dollar amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange.

January 1, 2027
IFRS 18 “Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements”
IFRS 18 will supersede IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The main changes comprise:
 
 
●
 
Items of income and expenses included in the statement of profit or loss shall be classified into the operating, investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued operations categories.
 
 
●
 
The statement of profit or loss shall present totals and subtotals for operating profit or loss, profit or loss before financing and income taxes and profit or loss.
 
 
●
 
Provides guidance to enhance the requirements of aggregation and disaggregation: The Company shall identify the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows that arise from individual transactions or other events and shall classify and aggregate them into groups based on shared characteristics, so as to result in the presentation in the primary financial statements of line items that have at least one similar characteristic. The Company shall disaggregate items with dissimilar characteristics in the primary financial statements and in the notes. The Company labels items as “other” only if it cannot find a more informative label.
Except for the above impact, as of the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued, the Company continues in evaluating other impacts of the above amended standards and on its financial position and financial performance from the initial adoption of the aforementioned standards or interpretations and related applicable period. The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes its evaluation.
5. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION
Material accounting policies are summarized as follows:
Statement of Compliance
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.
Basis of Preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
 
F - 14


Table of Contents
Basis of Consolidation
The basis for the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the parent.
When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between:
 
 
a.
the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and
 
 
b.
the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.
The Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.

Note a:
This is an immaterial subsidiary for which the consolidated financial statements are neither reviewed nor audited by the Company’s independent auditors.
 
 
Note b:
This is an immaterial subsidiary for which the consolidated financial statements for the year ended, are audited by the Company’s independent auditors.
 
 
Note c:
As VisEra’s employees continue to exercise their employee share options, TSMC’s ownership in VisEra continues to decline. This transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction since the transaction did not change TSMC’s control over VisEra.
 
 
Note d:
JASM has increased its capital and converted its preferred shares to common shares in July 2024. The increase in capital resulted in changes in shareholding rights from 71% to 73% and voting rights from 81% to 73%, respectively.
 
 
Note e:
ESMC was established in June 2023. TSMC sold its 10% shares to Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V. in January 2024, respectively. After selling shares, TSMC’s shareholding in ESMC decreased from 100% to 70%. This transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction since the transaction did not change TSMC’s control over ESMC.
 
 
Note f:
VTAF II, VTAF III and Growth Fund are under liquidation procedures.
Foreign Currencies
The financial statements of each individual consolidated entity were expressed in the currency which reflected its primary economic environment (functional currency). The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the operating results and financial positions of each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.
In preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.
 
F - 16


Table of Contents
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).
Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities
Current assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
 
 
a.
Category of financial assets and measurement
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.
 
 
1)
Financial asset at FVTPL
For certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.
 
 
2)
Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI
Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.
 
F - 17


Table of Contents
Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.
 
 
3)
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI
On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity.
Dividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the Company’s rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
 
 
4)
Measured at amortized cost
Cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables, refundable deposits and temporary payments (including those classified under other current assets and other noncurrent assets) are measured at amortized cost.
Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.
 
 
b.
Impairment of financial assets
At the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.
The loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
The Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.

c.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.
On derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.
Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

Hedge Accounting
 
 
a.
Fair value hedge
The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.
 
 
b.
Cash flow hedge
The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks or interest rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When forecast transactions actually take place, the accumulated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the initial cost of the hedged items, or reclassified to finance costs of hedged items in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
The Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
 
 
c.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as bank loans denominated in foreign currency, as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage the exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations due to currency fluctuations. Any gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of foreign currency translation reserve. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
The gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge, which were accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve, are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method
Investments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
 
F - 20


Table of Contents
The operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
The Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company ceases to have significant influence over an associate. When the Company retains an interest in the former associate, the Company measures the retained interest at fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. If the Company’s ownership interest in an associate is reduced as a result of disposal, but the investment continues to be an associate, the Company should reclassify to profit or loss only a proportionate amount of the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income.
When the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company’s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company’s ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
When a consolidated entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.
 
F - 21


Table of Contents
Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 10 to 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.
Leases
For a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Company as lessor
Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Company as lessee
Except for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated statements of financial position.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.
Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated statements of financial position.

Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Other intangible assets
Other separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
 
F - 23



Table of Contents
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified locations.
Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.
Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.
Retirement benefits
For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.
Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.
Treasury Stock
Treasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders’ equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Share-based payment arrangements
 
 
a.
Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements
Restricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and the Company’s best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned stock-based employee compensation.
When restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned stock-based employee compensation is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.
 
 
b.
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the earnings arise and adjusted to the extent that distributions are approved by the shareholders in the following year.
Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
 
F - 25


Table of Contents
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Government Grants
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets. Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Material Accounting Judgments
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 5 are satisfied.
Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)
As described in Note 5, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
 
F - 26


Table of Contents
Judgments on Lease Terms
In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.
Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty
Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances
Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.
Valuation of Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.
The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.
Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill
In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.
Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.
Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates
In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.

Fair value hedge
The Company entered into interest rate futures contracts, which are used to partially hedge against the fair value changes caused by interest rate fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.
 
F - 30


Table of Contents
On the basis of economic relationships, the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.
The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses, net.
The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risks.

Cash flow hedge
The Company entered into forward contracts to partially hedge foreign exchange rate risks or interest rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.
On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Refer to Note 21(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged item affects profit or loss, and the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
TSMC has designated the bank loans denominated in foreign currency as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage its foreign currency risk arising from investment in overseas subsidiaries.
The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the material difference between the notional amount of bank loans denominated in foreign currency and the net investment in foreign operations. No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Refer to Note 21 (d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments.

The Company signed a contract with the bank to sell certain accounts receivable without recourse and transaction cost required. These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.

(Concluded)
The significant part of the Company’s buildings includes main plants, mechanical and electrical power equipment and clean rooms, and the related depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful lives of 20 years, 10 years and 10 years, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of NT$790.7 million for certain machinery and equipment that were assessed to have no future use, and the recoverable amount of the aforementioned assets were nil. Such impairment loss was recognized in other operating income and expenses.
In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recognized an impairment loss due to partial plant facilities and machinery and equipment damage caused by an earthquake, which rendered them unusable. Please refer to the related earthquake losses in Note 37.
Information about capitalized interest is set out in Note 24.

The Company’s goodwill has been tested for impairment at the end of the annual reporting period and the recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use. The value in use was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial budgets covering the future five-year period, and the Company used annual discount rates of 9.0% and 9.3% in its test of impairment as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, to reflect the relevant specific risk in the cash-generating unit.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company did not recognize any impairment loss on goodwill.

The long-term bank loans of the Company are used for plants setup, procurement of machinery and equipment, and operating capital. The partial long-term bank loans are with preferential interest rates subsidized by the government, and the loans are used to fund capital expenditure qualifying for the subsidy.
The Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants during the borrowing period, including the annual equity of the subsidiary receiving the partial loan not to fall below a specific amount; its debt-to-equity ratio must not exceed a certain ratio; and the ratio of the Company’s annual debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) not to exceed a certain multiple.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
 
 
a.
Defined contribution plans
The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC Europe, TSMC Japan, TSMC JDC, TSMC 3DIC, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, JASM, ESMC, TSMC Technology and TSMC Canada also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$4,550.4 million, NT$5,365.5 million and NT$5,932.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 

 
b.
Defined benefit plans 

TSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.
Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:

The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by qualified actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:

Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:
 
 
1)
Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.
 
 
2)
Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.

 
F - 48


Table of Contents
Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$757.7 million and NT$717.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
 
 
3)
Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$735.2 million and NT$697.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 respectively.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.
The Company expects to make contributions of NT$1,870.0 million to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2024. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years.

Retained earnings and dividend policy
TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation.
 
F - 50


Table of Contents
TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.
The legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.
Pursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside an additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders’ equity, such as the accumulated balance of the foreign currency translation reserve, the effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders’ equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses. 
The appropriations of 2022, 2023 and 2024 quarterly earnings have been approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors in its meeting, respectively. The appropriations and cash dividends per share were as follows:

Vesting conditions of the aforementioned arrangement are as follow:
 
 
1)
The RSAs granted to eligible employees can only be vested if
 
 
●
 
the employee remains employed by the Company on the last date of each vesting period;
 
 
●
 
during the vesting period, the employee may not breach any agreement with the Company or violate the Company’s work rules; and
 
 
●
 
certain employee performance metrics and TSMC’s business performance metrics are met.

2)
The maximum percentage of granted RSAs that may be vested each year shall be as follows: one-year anniversary of the grant: 50%; two-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; and three-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; provided that the actual percentage and number of the RSAs to be vested in each year will be calculated based on the achievement of TSMC’s business performance metrics.
 
 
3)
For eligible executive officers of TSMC: The maximum number of RSAs that may be vested in each year will be set as 110%, among which 100% will be subject to a calculation based on TSMC’s relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”, including capital gains and dividends) achievement to determine the number of RSAs to be vested; this number will be further subject to a modifier to increase or decrease up to 10% based on the Compensation and People Development Committee’s evaluation of TSMC’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) achievements. The number of shares so calculated should be rounded down to the nearest integral.

 





TSMC’s TSR relative to the
TSR of S&P 500 IT Index
  
Ratio of Shares to be Vested

4)
Restrictions imposed on the employees’ rights in the RSAs before the vesting conditions are fulfilled:
 
 
●
 
During each vesting period, no employee granted RSAs, except for inheritance, may sell, pledge, transfer, give to another person, create any encumbrance on, or otherwise dispose of, any shares under the unvested RSAs.

 

 
●
 
Before the vesting conditions are fulfilled, the attendance, proposal rights, speech rights, voting rights and etc. shall be exercised by the engaged trustee/custodian on the employee’s behalf. Any other shareholder rights including but not limited to the entitlement to any distribution regarding dividends, bonuses and capital reserve, and the subscription right of the new shares issued for any capital increase, are the same as those of holders of common shares of TSMC.

Financial risk management objectives
The Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.
The plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.
 
 
c.
Market risk
The Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.
Foreign currency risk
Substantially all the Company’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, net investments in foreign operations, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.
Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$1,704.6 million, NT$891.0 million and NT$1,906.3 million, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.
The majority of the Company’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI or at amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not

reflected in the carrying amount. Both classifications recognized in profit or loss if the assets are sold. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.
Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company’s other comprehensive income by NT$3,831.3 million, NT$3,842.0 million and NT$4,500.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.
The majority of the Company’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.
Other price risk
The Company is exposed to convertible preferred stocks, equity instrument investments, and other investments price risk arising from financial assets at FVTPL and FVTOCI.
Assuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the investments mentioned above at the end of the reporting period, the net income would have decreased by NT$1,073.4 million and NT$1,216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$631.5 million, NT$954.9 million and NT$1,013.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

 
d.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.
Business related credit risk
The Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 91% and 93% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.
Financial credit risk
The Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.

Table of Contents
The objective of the Company’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested securities since initial recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material information of the issuers.
The Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the probability of default and loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies. The current credit risk assessment policies are as follows:

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the expected credit loss increased NT$57.9 million, increased NT$35.8 million and increased NT$58.5 million, respectively. The changes were mainly due to adjusted investment portfolio and fluctuations in exchange rates.
 
 
e.
Liquidity risk management
The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTOCI-current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.
The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.

Fair value of financial instruments
 
 
1)
Fair value measurements recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position
Fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 
 
●
 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
 
●
 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

●
 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The timing of transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy is at the end of reporting period.

Note:
  
The transfer from level 3 to level 1 is because quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets data became available for the equity investments.

Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 2 fair value measurement
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
 
 
●
 
The fair values of corporate bonds, agency bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and government bonds are determined by quoted market prices provided by third party pricing services.
 
 
●
 
The fair values of forward contracts are measured using forward rates and discount rates derived from quoted market prices.
 
 
●
 
The fair value of accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI is determined by the present value of future cash flows based on the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.
Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 3 fair value measurement
The fair values of convertible preferred stocks, convertible bonds, simple agreement for future equity, mutual funds and non-publicly traded equity investments (excluding those trading on the Emerging Stock Board) are mainly determined by using the asset approach, income approach and market approach.
The asset approach takes into account the net asset value measured at the fair value by independent parties. On December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$52.7 million and NT$56.2 million, respectively, if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.
The income approach utilizes discounted cash flows to determine the present value of the expected future economic benefits that will be derived from the investment. On December 31, 2024, the Company mainly uses unobservable inputs, which include expected returns, discount rate of 8.6%, and discount for lack of marketability of 20%. On December 31, 2024, with other inputs remain equal, if discount rate increases by 1%, the fair value will decrease by NT$1,606.9 million; if discount for lack of marketability increases by 1%, the fair value will decrease by NT$140.8 million.
For the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.

The compensation to directors and other key management personnel were determined by the Compensation and People Development Committee of TSMC in accordance with the individual performance and market trends.
 
35.
PLEDGED ASSETS
The Company provided certificate of deposits recorded in other financial assets as collateral mainly for building lease agreements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the aforementioned other financial assets amounted to NT$124.3 million and NT$132.1 million, respectively.
 
36.
SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS
Significant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:
 
 
a.
Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee approved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC’s capacity provided TSMC’s outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of the end of reporting period, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.
 

 
b.
Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. TSMC’s equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC’s capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as of the end of reporting period.

 
 
c.
In February 2025, Longitude Licensing Ltd. and Marlin Semiconductor Limited (collectively, “Marlin”) filed complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC and its customers infringe five U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation on March 21, 2025. The outcome cannot be determined, and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.

 
 
d.
TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies and agreements of waste disposal with multiple suppliers. The relative minimum fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreements.

h.
The Company entrusted financial institutions to provide performance guarantees mainly for import and export of goods, lease agreement and energy purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the aforementioned guarantee amounted to NT$8,013.0 million and NT$10,315.6 million, respectively.
 
37.
SIGNIFICANT LOSS FROM DISASTER
On April 3, 2024, an earthquake struck Taiwan. The resulting damage was mostly to inventories, plant facilities and machinery and equipment. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recognized related earthquake losses to be approximately NT$3 billion, net of insurance claim. Such losses were primarily included in the cost of revenue and other operating income and expenses in net amounts.
In January 2025, several earthquakes struck Taiwan. The resulting damage was mostly to inventories, machinery and equipment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company recognized related earthquake losses to be approximately NT$5.3 billion, net of insurance claim. Such losses were primarily included in the cost of revenue and other operating income and expenses in net amounts.
 
38.
OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION
 
 
a.
Operating segments, segment revenue and operating results
TSMC’s chief operating decision makers periodically review operating results, focusing on operating income generated by foundry segment. Operating results are used for resource allocation and/or performance assessment. As a result, the Company has only one operating segment, the foundry segment. The foundry segment engages mainly in the manufacturing, sales, packaging, testing and computer-aided design of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices and the manufacturing of masks.

The basis for the measurement of income from operations is the same as that for the preparation of financial statements. Please refer to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the related segment revenue and operating results.
