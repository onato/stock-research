VALUATION INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THE MARKET IS PRICING IN:

At $326.12, the market is implying growth rates that exceed even the bull
case scenario. This suggests investors are pricing in:

1. Sustained AI accelerator growth of 50%+ CAGR through 2030
2. Zero cyclical risk to semiconductor demand
3. Perfect execution on N2 (2nm) and N3 (3nm) technology ramps
4. Minimal geopolitical risk from Taiwan-China tensions
5. Continued market share gains and pricing power
6. Operating leverage driving margins to 60%+ gross margin territory

WHAT THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS:

Even under the bull case (AI super-cycle continues, 30% growth Y1-Y2):
  - Intrinsic value is $299, implying 8% downside from current price
  - For 15% CAGR returns, entry price should be $190 (42% below current)

Under the base case (management guidance met, 28% growth Y1):
  - Intrinsic value is $188, implying 42% downside
  - For 15% CAGR returns, entry price should be $115 (65% below current)

Probability-weighted value of $200 suggests 39% downside from current levels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (Base Case)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intrinsic Value by WACC and Terminal Growth Rate:

WACC    3.0%     3.5%     4.0%     4.5%     5.0%
------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------
8.5%    $230.54  $249.54  $272.77  $301.81  $339.14
9.5%    $194.71  $207.63  $222.90  $241.22  $263.61
10.5%   $168.49  $177.74  $188.42  $200.88  $215.60
11.5%   $148.47  $155.36  $163.17  $172.10  $182.40
12.5%   $132.69  $137.98  $143.89  $150.54  $158.08

Current price ($326) exceeds all reasonable combinations of WACC and terminal
growth in the base case projection. This indicates significant overvaluation
relative to fundamental cash flow expectations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INVESTMENT RISKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. GEOPOLITICAL RISK (Extreme Severity, Low but Rising Probability)
   - 90%+ of advanced chip production in Taiwan
   - China-Taiwan military conflict would be catastrophic
   - Geopolitical risk premium may not be sufficient at current valuation

2. AI DEMAND CYCLICALITY (High Severity, Moderate Probability)
   - Revenue growth of 30% predicated on sustained AI chip demand
   - If AI "bubble" deflates or cloud capex contracts, severe impact
   - CoWoS capacity expansion assumes sustained demand through 2027+

3. CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION (High Severity, Low-Moderate Probability)
   - Apple ~22%, NVIDIA ~12%, Top 10 = 76% of revenue
   - Loss of major customer or demand slowdown = material impact
   - Customers have significant bargaining power

4. VALUATION RISK (High Severity, High Probability)
   - Trading at 46.8x trailing P/E (elevated for semiconductor sector)
   - Minimal margin of safety at current price
   - Any growth disappointment = multiple compression + earnings decline
   - Historical semiconductor cycles: 20-30% earnings declines common

5. EXECUTION RISK (Moderate Severity, Low Probability)
   - Massive capex ($50B+ annually) requires flawless execution
   - Multiple simultaneous fab ramps (Arizona, Japan, Germany)
   - N2 (2nm) technology transition with new GAA architecture

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATALYSTS FOR RE-RATING (Could justify higher valuation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POSITIVE CATALYSTS:
  - AI accelerator demand exceeds 50%+ CAGR expectations
  - N2 (2nm) ramp ahead of schedule with premium pricing
  - Geographic diversification meaningfully reduces Taiwan risk premium
  - Operating margin expansion from scale (approaching 60% gross margin)
  - Resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions
  - Samsung/Intel competitive failures drive market share gains

NEGATIVE CATALYSTS:
  - AI demand disappointment or cloud capex pullback
  - Geopolitical escalation (Taiwan-China tensions)
  - Major customer loss or diversification away from TSM
  - Technology catch-up by Samsung or Intel
  - Margin compression from overseas fab cost structure
  - Semiconductor cyclical downturn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
METHODOLOGY NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DCF Approach:
  - 5-year explicit forecast period (2025-2029)
  - Terminal value using perpetuity growth method
  - WACC range: 9.5% (bull) to 12.5% (bear) reflecting geopolitical risk
  - Terminal growth: 3.0% (bear) to 4.5% (bull)

Key Assumptions:
  - FY2024 FCF margin of 30.1% reflects massive growth capex ($30B)
  - Projections assume capex moderates as facilities come online
  - FCF margins improve to 28-38% range as operational leverage kicks in
  - Growth rates based on management guidance (30% revenue growth for 2026)
  - Net cash position of $36.5B adds value and provides capex buffer

Scenario Probabilities:
  - Bull Case: 30% (AI super-cycle extends)
  - Base Case: 50% (management guidance met)
  - Bear Case: 20% (AI disappointment, geopolitical stress)

Entry Price Calculation:
  - Assumes 15% CAGR target return
  - Calculated by discounting terminal value per share at 15% for 5 years
  - Base case entry price: $115 (65% below current price)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOTTOM LINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TSM is an exceptional company with a wide moat, technology leadership, and
exposure to the AI mega-trend. However, at $326 per ADR, the stock is pricing
in a nearly perfect scenario with minimal room for error.

The probability-weighted intrinsic value of $200 suggests 39% downside from
current levels. Even the bull case ($299) implies modest downside.

For value-oriented investors seeking 15% annualized returns, the entry price
in the base case is $115, representing a 65% discount from current price.

RECOMMENDATION: WAIT FOR BETTER ENTRY
  - Monitor for pullback to $250-280 range (bull case territory)
  - Ideal entry: $180-220 range (base case + margin of safety)
  - Strong buy below $150 (substantial margin of safety)

Current valuation reflects market exuberance around AI theme. Patient investors
will likely find better entry points as cyclical realities reassert or if any
of the significant risks materialize.
