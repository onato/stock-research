              EBOS reviews the recoverable amount of its tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, at each balance
                                                                                                                                            Revenue from external customers ($’000)
              date. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in the
              income statement.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Directory
              Tangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
              (CGUs). The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of
              future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).
              Depreciation and amortisation
              Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land,                  2019                                                2018
              at depreciation rates calculated to allocate the assets’ cost less estimated residual value, over their estimated
              useful lives. Refer to note D1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation.
              Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of finite life intangibles. Refer to note
              B1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of amortisation.

             Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when a liability is settled or an asset
             realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.                                                                                                                      2019                        2018

             A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to use the
             asset. This is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient              Gross carrying amount
             taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise the deferred tax asset.

             At each balance sheet date, EBOS reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether                                                           A$’000             A$’000            A$’000
             there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the

 premium paid. In addition, goodwill resulted from the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above
 the current fair value of the assets acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained.
 These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably
 measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.

 WW was acquired as it is a profitable Australian healthcare distribution business, which the Group believes fits strategically with
 its Australian healthcare business assets.

 Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group for the period ended 30 June 2019

 WW contributed $1,252,000 to the Group profit for the period. Group revenue for the period includes $36,684,000 in respect
 of WW. Had the WW acquisition been effective at 1 July 2018, the revenue of the Group from continuing operations would have
 been $6,938,436,000 and the profit for the period would have been $136,951,000.

           Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.

           Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost,
           using the effective interest method.

           The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
                                                                                                                                     Reconciliation of the carrying amount from the beginning to the end of the year ($’000)
           Trade payables are unsecured and are generally settled within the month following the invoice date.

             An associate is an entity over which EBOS has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a
             joint venture or joint operation. EBOS has significant influence when it has the power to participate in the financial and
             operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not in control or joint control over those policies.

             Investments in associates are incorporated in the EBOS Group financial statements using the equity method of
             accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost
             and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in EBOS’ share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in
             the value of individual investments and less any dividends. Losses of an associate in excess of EBOS’ interest in that
             associate are recognised only to the extent that EBOS has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments
             on behalf of the associate.

             Any excess of the cost of acquisition over EBOS’ share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
             contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition, is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is
             included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
