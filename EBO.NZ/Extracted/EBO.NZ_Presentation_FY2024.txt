    KEY HIGHLIGHTS
    Continued strong earnings growth in Healthcare and Animal Care and investing for future growth

     Healthcare               •   EBOS’ Healthcare segment benefitted from its strong market positions and solid contributions from each of the
                                  Community Pharmacy, TerryWhite Chemmart (TWC) and Institutional Healthcare businesses. Key highlights
     EBITDA up 6.0%1
                                  included:
                                      o Strong organic growth across both our Australian and New Zealand pharmacy businesses;
                                      o TWC continued store expansion with the network reaching 600 stores2; and
                                      o Double digit Institutional Healthcare revenue growth driven by our hospital and medical technology
                                         businesses.
                              •   Particularly strong growth in Australia with Underlying EBITDA growth of 9.4%.
                              •   Continued investment in operational infrastructure.
                              •   The 8th Community Pharmacy Agreement (CPA) came into effect on 1 July 2024 and provides continued investment
                                  in the community pharmacy sector. The CSO deed has been extended whilst we finalise discussions with the
                                  Australian Government regarding arrangements in the first pharmacy wholesaler agreement.

     Animal Care              •   The Animal Care segment delivered double-digit Underlying EBITDA growth driven by the performance of higher
                                  margin businesses and the contribution from the Superior Pet Food Co. (Superior) acquisition.
     EBITDA up 13.2%1
                              •   The branded business delivered double-digit revenue growth driven by ongoing resilience in the pet food category.
                              •   Several new products were successfully launched under the Black Hawk and Vitapet brands.
                              •   The Superior acquisition, completed in July 2023, performed strongly and further strengthened the Group’s branded
                                  products portfolio.

     Group                    •   The Group continued to deliver stronger Underlying EBITDA growth of approximately 8% when normalised to
                                  exclude the Chemist Warehouse Australia (CWA) contract (compared to 7.3% actual Underlying EBITDA growth).
     NPAT up 7.7%1
                              •   Cost management is an area of focus for management with a reduction of 24bp in Underlying Operating
                                  Expenditure as a percentage of revenue.
                              •   Underlying operating cash flow of $367.0m reflects strong earnings growth and disciplined net working capital
                                  management.
                              •   Net Debt : EBITDA of 1.89x at 30 June 2024 is an improvement on the 2.06x reported at 31 December 2023.
                              •   ROCE of 15.3% at 30 June 2024 is in-line with target.

     • Underlying EPS of 157.9 cents representing growth of 6.8%.

     • Final dividend of NZ 61.5 cents per share declared (imputed to 25%1 and franked to 100% for New Zealand and Australian tax resident
       shareholders, respectively).

     • Full year dividend payout ratio of 69.5% on an underlying basis2.

     • EBOS reiterates its dividend policy of declaring dividends representing between 60% to 80% of NPAT.

     • The Group’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) will be operational for the upcoming final dividend. Shareholders can elect to take shares
       in lieu of a cash dividend at a discount of 2.5% to the volume weighted average share price (VWAP).




      Notes:
25    1. The New Zealand company tax rate is 28%. Therefore, a dividend that is partially imputed with 25% of the maximum allowable imputation
          credits implies an 8.86% imputation percentage in relation to the gross taxable amount of the dividend.
      2. Dividend payout ratio is based on an underlying basis on a NZD:AUD average exchange rate of 0.924.

     COSTS AND COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES

     • The Group successfully managed operating expenditure as a percentage of revenue and EBITDA margins in the inflationary
       environment.

     • Underlying Operating Expenditure is expected to continue to grow in FY25 reflecting ongoing business growth. Key cost growth drivers
       include:

        o   Volume growth across business units

        o   Investments in growing businesses and products

        o   IT costs

     • Our cost reduction initiatives will assist with partially offsetting this with ~$25-50m of savings identified for the next 1-2 years. Cost
       reduction initiatives are primarily targeting:

        o   Freight

        o   Packaging

        o   Labour

        o   COGS

        o   Administrative costs

     OUTLOOK
     • EBOS is pleased with the strong earnings growth achieved in FY24, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions.

     • Our earnings have demonstrated resilience and continued growth despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, reflecting the
       defensive and diverse nature of our Group.

     • Our FY25 performance will be impacted by the non-renewal of the CWA contract, which generated approximately $2.2 billion of
       revenue in FY24 and ceased on 30 June 2024.

     • To assist investors EBOS is providing guidance for FY25 that the Group expects to generate Underlying EBITDA of between $575m to
       $600m.

     • This guidance implies Underlying FY25 EBITDA growth compared to the prior year (excluding the CWA contract) of approximately 5%
       to 10%, driven by:
        o   Base business growth in both the Healthcare and Animal Care segments;
        o   Community Pharmacy revenue and segment share growth against a backdrop of changed industry dynamics; and
        o   Cost reduction initiatives across the Group.

     • July 2024 trading demonstrated positive growth compared to the prior corresponding period (excluding the CWA contract) and is
       supportive of the FY25 guidance. A further trading update for the first three months of FY25 will be provided at the Annual Meeting in
       October 2024.

     • ROCE is expected to decline in FY25 reflective of the guidance above. ROCE remains a key focus of the Group and we expect to
       grow ROCE back towards our 15% target within the short to medium term.

     • EBOS’ balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to pursue growth opportunities.
