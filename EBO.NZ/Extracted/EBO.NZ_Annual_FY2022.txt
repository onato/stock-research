When acquiring Symbion, EBOS inherited the rich history of the Faulding brand, which celebrated 177 years in business on 19 May
2022. Francis Hardy Faulding opened his first pharmacy at 5 Rundle Street, Adelaide in 1845 and while the business has evolved
considerably since then, Faulding continues to live on as part of the EBOS Group, a respected brand that supports the health
and wellbeing of Australians.

          bears the risks of loss in relation to the goods.

          A receivable is recognised by the Group when it passes control of the goods, which is when the goods are delivered to
          the customer as this represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the
          passage of time is required before payment is made.

          The transaction price may be adjusted for customers who pay their account in full, earlier than what standard credit terms
          would require, or for incremental costs incurred in obtaining a sales contract which are recognised over the contractual
          period. Under the Group’s standard terms with customers, product returns, refunds and provision for warranties are in
          accordance with local requirements. Accumulated experience has been used to determine that such returns are not
          significant.

           EBOS reviews the recoverable amount of its tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, at each balance date. If the
           carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in the income statement.            The following is an analysis of EBOS’ revenue and results by reportable segment:
           Tangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs).
                                                                                                                                              Revenue from external customers (A$’000)
           The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of future cash flows
           expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).

           Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
           The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities
           incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by EBOS in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related
           costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
           Where applicable, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
           arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the
           cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value
           of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant NZ IFRSs.
           Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.

          The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on trade receivables. The amount of ECL                                                                                                              A$’000                        A$’000
          is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial
          instrument.

          The Group measures the provision for ECL using the simplified approach to measuring ECL, which uses a lifetime expected               Current
          loss allowance for all trade receivables. The Group determines lifetime ECL for groups of trade receivables with shared               Trade payables                                                                         1,767,572                    1,469,202

          Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than
          90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable basis that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.
