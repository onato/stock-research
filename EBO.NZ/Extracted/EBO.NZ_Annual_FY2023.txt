                     Our DNA
                     At EBOS, our purpose is clear: we advance
                     opportunities to enrich lives.
                     Across our Company, our businesses are guided by a
                     set of values and a united vision to help those who rely
                     on our vast experience, breadth of services and broad
                     expertise.
                     Whether administering vaccines, comforting a sick
                     child, ensuring critical medical supplies arrive on time,
                     or providing the best nutrition to a precious pet –
                     our commitment to our customers and communities
                     is at the core of everything we do.
                     Our people play a vital role on the frontline of the
                     healthcare industry, distributing medicines, vaccines
                     and protective equipment to doctors, nurses and
                     patients.
                     This commitment to help others was underlined
                     across New Zealand and Australia when our people
                     supported cyclone and flood affected communities to
                     help them through the impact of these natural events.

                     matters.
                     Through a culture of innovation, collaboration,
                     and continued investment in our facilities and
                     people, we continue to strive forward and remain
                     agile to meet evolving local and global healthcare and      Our business is integral to communities receiving the right

                     It is our focus on excellence and going above and
                     beyond that enables us to positively impact the lives
                     of thousands of people each day. This dedication

 The demand for pet food and pet care products and
 services has continued to grow following the surge in pet
 ownership during the COVID pandemic.
 In 2022, Australians spent more than $4.4 billion* on food
 and treats to satisfy the appetites of their favourite pets,
 and that is expected to increase amid the trend towards
 the premiumisation of pet food.
 Our Animal Care segment is well prepared to meet the
 growing demand from pet parents for high-quality food,
 with the official opening last year of our Pet Care Kitchen
 in Parkes, NSW.
 The 12,000m2 facility, which commenced operations
 in the second half of FY22 and employs more than
 60 staff, is running 24 hours, 5 days a week, and can
 produce more than 3.3 million bags of Black Hawk kibble

          Recognition and measurement

          Community Pharmacy and Institutional Healthcare
          Revenue is derived from the supply of human healthcare products to pharmacies, hospitals, aged care facilities,
          supermarkets and other healthcare providers in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia markets. This includes the
          supply of agency products, EBOS’ own branded human healthcare products and distributed by the Group’s branded
          distribution businesses. Following delivery of the goods, the customer obtains control as it has full discretion over the
          manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when on selling the goods and bears the
          risks of loss in relation to the goods.

          A receivable is recognised by the Group when it passes control of the goods, which is when the goods are delivered to
          the customer as this represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the
          passage of time is required before payment is made.

          The transaction price may be adjusted for customers who pay their account in full, earlier than what standard credit terms
          would require, or for incremental costs incurred in obtaining a sales contract which are recognised over the contractual
          period. Under the Group’s standard terms with customers, product returns, refunds and provision for warranties are in
          accordance with local requirements. Accumulated experience has been used to determine that such returns are not
          significant.

             EBOS reviews the recoverable amount of its tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, at each balance date. If the
                                                                                                                                                                          Revenue from external customers (A$’000)
             carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in the income statement.
             Tangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs).                                              2023                                     2022
             The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of future cash flows
             expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).
             Depreciation and amortisation
             Depreciation is provided for on a straight line basis on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land,
             at depreciation rates calculated to allocate the assets’ cost less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful
             lives. Refer to note D1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation.
             Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of finite life intangibles. Refer to note B1(d)
             for the useful lives used in the calculation of amortisation.
             Short term and low value asset leases
             EBOS leases certain land, buildings, plant and equipment.
             The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and low value asset
             leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with the leases as an expense (recognised within other
             expenses in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term).

          Deferred tax is income tax that is expected to be payable or recoverable in the future as a result of the unwinding of
          temporary differences. These arise from differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and
          for the filing of income tax returns.

          Judgement: useful lives of indefinite life intangible assets
                                                                                                                                              For the year ended 30 June 2023, the Directors have determined that there is no impairment of any of the CGUs containing goodwill,
          The Directors have assessed these brands, trademarks and a franchise network asset as having an indefinite useful life.
                                                                                                                                              brands, trademarks or the franchise network asset (2022: Nil).
          In coming to this conclusion the expected expansion of these assets across other products and markets, the typical product
          life cycle of these assets, the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, the level of maintenance expenditure              Key judgement: impairment assessment assumption

         Management has carried out a sensitivity analysis and believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions
         would not cause the book value of any CGUs or groups of CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.                                               Other finite life intangible assets comprise primarily software.

         Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.

         The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities              Section Overview
         incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by EBOS in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related
         costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.                                                                                         This section provides further analysis on the significant operating assets and liabilities of EBOS. These balances

         Where applicable, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
         arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the
         cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of
         contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant NZ IFRSs. Changes     C1. Trade and other receivables

 Goodwill arose on the acquisitions of the business operations during the year. In addition, goodwill resulted from the consideration
 paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above the current fair value of the assets acquired and the expected synergies and
 future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future         Trade receivables (i)                                                                        1,414,658                         1,310,185

         The Group measures the provision for ECL using the simplified approach to measuring ECL, which uses a lifetime expected

         ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and
         distribution.
