To the Shareholders of EBOS Group Limited


 Opinion                 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of EBOS Group Limited (the ‘Company’) and its
                         subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2024, and the
                         consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash
                         flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material
                         accounting policy information.

                         In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 34 to 85, present fairly, in all
                         material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2024, and its consolidated
                         financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents
                         to IFRS Accounting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’) as issued by the External Reporting Board and IFRS Accounting
                         Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.


 Basis for Opinion       We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and International
                         Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described
                         in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

                         We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
                         our opinion.

                         We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of
                         Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by
                         the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
                         Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
                         Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

                         Our firm carries out other assignments for the Group in the area of taxation compliance services. These services
                         have not impaired our independence as auditor of the Group. In addition to this, partners and employees of our
                         firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the
                         Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.


 Audit Materiality       We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements
                         of the Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
                         knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also
                         assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or
                         influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the
                         scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

                         We determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be $19.2m.


 Key Audit Matters       Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
                         of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
                         our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not

assumptions applied in the value-in-use models are:

We have included the impairment assessments of goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets as a key audit matter due to the
significance of the balances to the financial statements and the
level of judgement applied by the Group in determining the key
assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts.

         Recognition and measurement

         Community Pharmacy and Institutional Healthcare
         Revenue is derived from the supply of human healthcare products to pharmacies, hospitals, aged care facilities, supermarkets
         and other healthcare providers in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia markets. This includes the supply of agency
         products and EBOS’ own branded human healthcare products distributed by the Group’s branded distribution businesses.
         Following delivery of the goods, the customer obtains control as it has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to
         sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when on selling the goods and bears the risks of loss in relation to the goods.

         A receivable is recognised by the Group when it passes control of the goods, which is when the goods are delivered to the customer
         as this represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time is
         required before payment is made.

         The transaction price may be adjusted for customers who pay their account in full, earlier than what standard credit terms would
         require, or for incremental costs incurred in obtaining a sales contract which are recognised over the contractual period.
         Under the Group’s standard terms with customers, product returns, refunds and provision for warranties are in accordance with
         local requirements. Accumulated experience has been used to determine that such returns are not significant.

Recognition and measurement

          Impairment
          EBOS reviews the recoverable amount of its tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, at each balance date. If the
          carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in the income statement.
          Tangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). The recoverable
          amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated
          by the asset (value in use).
          Depreciation and amortisation
          Depreciation is provided for on a straight line basis on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land,
          at depreciation rates calculated to allocate the assets’ cost less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives.
          Refer to note D1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation.
          Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of finite life intangibles. Refer to note B1(d) for the
          useful lives used in the calculation of amortisation.
          Short term and low value asset leases
          EBOS leases certain land, buildings, plant and equipment.
          The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and low value asset leases.
          The Group recognises the lease payments associated with the leases as an expense (recognised within other expenses in the
          Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term).

(b) Expenses continued

          Employee expenses
          Provision is made for benefits owing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and
          employee incentives for services rendered. Provisions are recognised when it is probable they will be settled and can be
          measured reliably. They are carried at the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement and discounted to the
          present value of the expected payment to the employee at balance date.
          Net finance costs
          Finance costs include bank interest and amortisation of costs incurred in connection with borrowing facilities. Finance costs
          are expensed immediately as incurred, using the effective interest method, unless they relate to acquisition and development
          of qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised.
          Interest income is recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest method.

(d) Information about major customers

No revenues from transactions that are with a single customer amount to 10% or more of EBOS’ revenues (2023: Nil).

         Recognition and measurement

         The reportable segments of EBOS have been identified in accordance with NZ IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.

         The Group’s operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly
         reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.

         The accounting policies of EBOS have been consistently applied to the operating segments. Profit before depreciation,
         amortisation, net finance costs and tax expense (EBITDA) is the measure reported to the chief operating decision-maker for the
         purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

         Assets are not allocated to operating segments as they are not reported to the chief operating decision-maker at a segment level.

        Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected

        realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been
        enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.

        A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent it is
        probable that future taxable profits will be available to
        use the asset. This is reviewed at each balance date and
        reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
        sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to
        utilise the deferred tax asset.

         Recognition and measurement

         Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition
         date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests
         in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest (if any) in the acquiree over the fair value of the
         identifiable net assets recognised.

         Goodwill is not amortised; however, it is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
         goodwill is allocated to each of EBOS’ CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

         CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that
         the unit may be impaired. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable
         amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any

         profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.

          Recognition and measurement

          Indefinite life intangible assets represent purchased brands, trademarks and a franchise network asset that are initially
          recognised at fair value. These intangible assets are tested annually for impairment on the same basis as for goodwill.

          Judgement: useful lives of indefinite life intangible assets

          The Directors have assessed these brands, trademarks and a franchise network asset as having an indefinite useful life. In coming
          to this conclusion, the expected expansion of these assets across other products and markets, the typical product life cycle of
          these assets, the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, the level of maintenance expenditure required and the
          period of legal control over these assets has been considered.

For the year ended 30 June 2024, the Directors have determined that there is no impairment of any of the CGUs containing goodwill,
brands, trademarks or the franchise network asset (2023: Nil).


           Key judgement: impairment assessment assumption
           The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined on the basis of value in use calculations.
           The recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes in the following assumptions:

             Revenue                       Estimated by management based on revenue achieved in the period immediately before the start of the
                                           assessment period and adjusted each year for any anticipated growth.

             Operating costs               Estimated by management based on current trends at the start of the assessment period and adjusted
                                           for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

             Discount rates                Estimated by management based on a current market assessment of the time value of money,
                                           cost of capital and risks specific to the asset or CGU to which the cash flows generated by that asset
                                           or CGU are being assessed.




                                                                                                                                                             53

        Key estimate: value in use calculation

        The value in use calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by the Board and management
        covering a five year period, including terminal value, and management’s past experience. The following estimates, excluding the
        impact of known business losses, were used in the value in use calculation:

(1) Non-cash amortisation of intangibles recognised on acquisitions.

          Recognition and measurement

          Finite life intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis
          over their estimated useful life.

          Other finite life intangible assets comprise primarily software.

          Judgement: Useful lives of finite life intangible assets

          In determining the estimated useful life of finite life intangible assets (of a period of between one to 13 years) the following
          characteristics have been assessed: (i) expected expansion of the usage of the assets, (ii) the typical product life cycle of these
          assets, (iii) the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, and (iv) the level of maintenance expenditure required.
          The estimated useful life and amortisation period is reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.

         At each balance sheet date, EBOS reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether there is any
         indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is
         estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
         independent from other assets, EBOS estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.

         Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
         flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
         of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

         If the recoverable amount of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
         (CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

         Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, other than for Goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to
         the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the
         carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years.
         A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. Impairment losses cannot be reversed for goodwill.

         3. To recognise current and deferred tax balances on acquisition.
         4. To recognise the fair value of inventories on acquisition.
         5. To recognise the fair value of property, plant and equipment on acquisition.
         6. To recognise the fair value of right of use assets on acquisition.

         10. To recognise the fair value of lease liabilities on acquisition.
         11. To recognise the fair value of employee benefits on acquisition.


         Recognition and measurement

         Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.

         The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred
         or assumed, and equity instruments issued by EBOS in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are
         recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

         Where applicable, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement,
         measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition
         where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent
         consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant NZ IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of
         contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.

Goodwill arising on acquisition

Goodwill arose on the acquisitions of the business operations of Superior and CAB because the cost of acquisition included a control
premium paid. In addition, goodwill resulted from the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above the current
fair value of the assets acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are
not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably measured and they do not
meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets. The accounting for the business combinations including goodwill arose is considered
provisional at balance date and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.

Superior is a leading manufacturer and supplier of dog treats and premium dog rolls based in New Zealand. This acquisition expands the
Group’s portfolio of branded products in attractive categories, increases our in-house manufacturing capabilities and accelerates our new
product development initiatives.

CAB is a distributor of foot and ankle devices, consumables and allografts operating in Australia. CAB was acquired as it is a profitable
Australian healthcare business which the Group believes fits strategically with its Australian healthcare business assets.

Impact of the acquisitions on the results of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2024

The impact of the acquisitions on the Group’s results for the period ended 30 June 2024 are not considered material.

         Recognition and measurement

         Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
         They are presented as current assets unless collection is not expected for more than 12 months after the reporting date.

         The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is
         no realistic prospect of recovery.

         The Directors believe that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value

(i) Trade receivables are non-interest bearing. Interest may be charged on outstanding overdue balances in accordance with the terms and

C1. Trade and other receivables continued

           Recognition and measurement

           The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on trade receivables. The amount of ECL is updated at
           each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

           The Group measures the provision for ECL using the simplified approach to measuring ECL, which uses a lifetime expected loss
           allowance for all trade receivables. The Group determines lifetime ECL for groups of trade receivables with shared credit risk
           characteristics. Groupings are based on customer, trading terms and ageing.

           An ECL rate is determined based on the historic credit loss rates for the Group, adjusted for other current observable data that may
           materially impact the Group’s future credit risk. This other observable data includes specific factors in relation to each debtor or
           general economic conditions of the industry in which the debtors operate.

           Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past
           due unless the Group has reasonable basis that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

           Recognition and measurement

           Inventories consist of raw materials (for the manufacturing operations of EBOS) and finished goods. Inventories are recognised
           at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
           where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present
           location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all
           estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

           Recognition and measurement

           Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.

           Trade and other payables, are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective
           interest method.

           The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

           Trade payables are unsecured and are generally settled within the month following the invoice date.

D1. Property, plant and equipment continued

        Recognition and measurement

        Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the original purchase consideration and those costs
        directly attributable to bringing the item of property, plant and equipment to the location and condition for its intended use.
        After recognition as an asset, property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
        losses.

        Depreciation of property, plant and equipment assets, other than freehold land, is calculated on a straight-line basis.
        This allocates the cost or fair value amount of an asset, less any residual value, over its estimated useful life.

        Judgements and estimates – useful lives

        EBOS estimates the remaining useful life of assets as follows:

        • Buildings: 20 to 50 years
        • Leasehold improvements: 2 to 20 years
        • Plant and equipment: 2 to 20 years
        • Office equipment, furniture and fittings: 2 to 20 years

        The residual value and useful lives are reviewed and if appropriate adjusted at each reporting date.

(i) E
     BOS, through a subsidiary company, has a trade debtor securitisation facility of $400.0m (2023: $400.0m) of which $219.3m was
    unutilised at 30 June 2024 (2023: $357.9m). The securitisation facility involves providing security over the future cash flows of specific trade
    receivables, which meet certain criteria, in return for cash finance on a contracted percentage of the security provided. As recourse, in the
    event of default by a trade debtor, remains with EBOS, the trade receivables provided as security and the funding provided are recognised
    on the EBOS Consolidated Balance Sheet.

  At 30 June 2024, the value of trade receivables provided as security under this securitisation facility was $236.7m (2023: $111.4m).
  The net cash flows associated with the securitisation programme are disclosed in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as cash flows
  from financing activities.

(ii) E
      BOS has gross bank term loan facilities of $1,632.4m (2023: $1,534.6m), of which $577.4m was unutilised at 30 June 2024 (2023: $598.2m).

     EBOS fully complies with and operates within the debt facility financial covenants under the arrangements with its bankers.




           Recognition and measurement

           All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received plus issue costs
           associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, these loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost
           using the effective interest method, which allocates the cost through the expected life of the loan or borrowing. The fair value of
           non-current borrowings is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
           Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless EBOS has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
           12 months after the balance sheet date.

           Recognition and measurement
           An associate is an entity over which EBOS has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture or
           joint operation. EBOS has significant influence when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of
           the investee, but is not in control or joint control over those policies.

           Investments in associates are incorporated in the Group’s financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the
           equity method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition
           changes in EBOS’ share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments and less any
           dividends. Losses of an associate in excess of EBOS’ interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that EBOS has
           incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

           Any excess of the cost of acquisition over EBOS’ share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
           liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying
           amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.

F3. Non-controlling interests
On 31 May 2022, the Group, through its subsidiary EBOS Medical Devices Australia Pty Ltd, acquired 100% of equity interest in Pacific Health
Supplies TopCo1 Pty Ltd and Pacific Health Supplies TopCo2 Pty Ltd (LifeHealthcare Group), including a 51% interest in Transmedic Pte Ltd
(Transmedic, a subsidiary of LifeHealthcare Group). The Group also entered into arrangements providing a pathway of up to 100% ownership
of Transmedic, resulting in a financial liability – derivative of $137.0m initially recognised on the balance sheet as at 30 June 2022 and a
corresponding adjustment to non-controlling interests. Subsequently, the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise of the option was
reassessed to $165.0m, as at 30 June 2023, with the movement of $28.0m recognised directly in equity.

During the current year, the Group purchased an additional 39% shareholding in Transmedic for a consideration of $134.6m, to increase its
shareholding in Transmedic to 90%. An option arrangement has also been entered into that will facilitate the Group moving to 100% ownership
in financial year 2026. As at 30 June 2024, the carrying value of the financial liability – derivative was $35.0m. Subsequent changes to the
carrying value of the financial liability – derivative are recognised directly in equity within non-controlling interests.

The table below shows details of Transmedic, the non-wholly owned subsidiary of the Group that has material non-controlling interests.
The other non-controlling interests are not considered material and are therefore not disclosed in the financial statements.

          Recognition and measurement
          Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. The non-controlling interests on the date
          of acquisition are initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the identifiable net
          assets assumed. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the valuation on initial recognition
          plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded
          directly in retained earnings.
                                                                                                                                                               75

Section G: How we manage risk

           Section Overview

           This section describes the financial risks that EBOS has identified and how it manages these risks, to protect its financial
           position and financial performance. Management of these risks includes the use of financial instruments to hedge against
           unfavourable interest rate and foreign currency movements.



G1. Financial risk management

The EBOS corporate treasury function provides services to the Group’s entities, co-ordinates access to financial markets, and manages
the financial risks relating to the operation of the Group.

EBOS does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. The use
of financial derivatives is governed by Group policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of
financial derivatives. Compliance with policies for exposure limits is reviewed by a committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis.



         Foreign currency risk                                                   Interest rate risk

         EBOS is exposed to foreign currency risk arising primarily              EBOS is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds
         from the procurement of goods denominated in foreign                    in New Zealand dollars, Singapore dollars and Australian
         currencies (US dollar, Australian dollars, Thai baht, Swiss             dollars at floating interest rates.
         Franc, Euro and British pound).
                                                                                 The risk is assessed and managed by the use of interest
         It is the policy of the Group to enter into foreign exchange            rate swap and interest rate collar contracts. In interest
         forward contracts to manage the foreign currency                        rate swap contracts, EBOS agrees to exchange the
         risk associated with anticipated sales and purchase                     difference between fixed and floating rate interest
         transactions typically out to 12 months of the exposure                 amounts calculated on agreed notional principal
         generated. It is the policy of the Group to enter into foreign          amounts. In interest rate collar contracts, EBOS pays
         exchange forward contracts for up to 100% of forecasted                 upfront premiums to cap the interest at strike rates
         foreign currency transactions for the next six months                   on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts
         and up to 80% of six to 12 months of forecasted foreign                 enable EBOS to partially mitigate the risk of changing

        non-controlling shareholders on their equity interest in
        a non-wholly owned subsidiary for settlement in cash a
        financial liability, at the present value of the exercise price
        of the option, is recognised. When the non-controlling
        interests still have present access to the returns associated
        with the underlying ownership interest, non-controlling
        interests continue to be recognised and accordingly
        the liability is considered a transaction with owners and
        recognised within non-controlling interests. Subsequent to
        the initial recognition, any changes in the carrying amount
        of the financial liability - derivative, including the accretion
        of interest, are recognised directly in equity within
        non-controlling interests.

External Auditor Rotation and Tender
As a New Zealand and Australian public interest entity the Group is required to maintain a five-year mandatory rotation period for the
appointment of the Group audit engagement partner.

The 2024 financial year is the first year of engagement for the current Group Audit Partner, with the previous Group engagement partner
having completed a five-year period as the Group’s auditor in the prior year.

Deloitte are the Group’s current Group auditor. Utilising Deloitte’s extensive global experience and presence, the audit engagement is led by
the Group engagement partner, however, is also supported by additional partners from Deloitte Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to audit
their respective component group entities across Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.

A formal request for proposal process was recently completed in August 2023 for the provision of external audit services to EBOS for the
financial years ending 30 June 2024 to 30 June 2026. After conducting the audit tender process led by the Audit and Risk Committee,
which invited audit proposals from the four major accounting firms, the Board determined that Deloitte should be retained as the Group’s
external auditor.

Waivers granted from the NZX Listing Rules/ASX Admission
There were no waivers granted by the NZX during the year or waivers
of NZX Listing Rules relied upon by the Company during the year.
The terms of the Company’s admission to the ASX and on-going
listing requires the following disclosures:
1. The Company is not subject to Chapters 6, 6A, 6B and 6C of the
    Australian Corporations Act dealing with the acquisition of shares
    (including substantial holdings and takeovers).
2. L
    imitations on the acquisition of securities imposed under New
   Zealand law are as follows:
 (a) In general, securities in the Company are freely transferable
     and the only significant restrictions or limitations in relation
     to the acquisition of securities are those imposed by New
     Zealand laws relating to takeovers, overseas investment and
     competition.
 (b) T
      he New Zealand Takeovers Code creates a general rule under
     which the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting rights in
     the Company or the increase of an existing holding of 20%
     or more of the voting rights of the Company can only occur
     in certain permitted ways. These include a full takeover offer
     in accordance with the Takeovers Code, a partial takeover
     in accordance with the Takeovers Code, an acquisition
     approved by an ordinary resolution, an allotment approved
     by an ordinary resolution, a creeping acquisition (in certain
     circumstances), or compulsory acquisition of a shareholder
     holding 90% or more of the shares.
 (c) T
      he New Zealand Overseas Investment Act 2005 and Overseas
     Investment Regulations 2005 (New Zealand) regulate certain
     investments in New Zealand by overseas interests. In general
     terms, the consent of the New Zealand Overseas Investment
     Office is likely to be required where an ‘overseas person’
     acquires shares in the Company that amount to 25% or more
     of the shares issued by the Company, or if the overseas person
     already holds 25% or more, the acquisition increases that
     holding.
 (d) The New Zealand Commerce Act 1986 is likely to prevent a
      person from acquiring shares in the Company if the acquisition
      would have, or would be likely to have, the effect of substantially
      lessening competition in the market.

alignment.

FY24 Performance and Remuneration Outcomes
In FY24 EBOS reported another year of strong performance by the
Group driven by continued organic growth as well as undertaking
several strategic investments. Group revenue exceeded $13 billion
(up 7.8%) for the first time reflecting particularly strong growth
within our Community Pharmacy and Institutional Healthcare
divisions. Overall, the Group reported underlying EBITDA of
$624.3 million (up 7.3%), underlying NPAT of $303.4 million (up 7.7%)
and underlying EPS of 157.9 cents (up 6.8%).

Significant investments undertaken in line with EBOS’ strategy of
investing for growth were completed during the period, including
increasing our shareholding in Southeast Asia business Transmedic
to 90% and completing the acquisition of Superior Pet Food Co.
In addition, we completed four small bolt-on acquisitions in the
Medical Technology and Medical Consumables businesses across
ANZ and Southeast Asia.

The Board assesses the performance of the CEO against set targets.
The short term incentive of the CEO is assessed on the annual
earnings performance of the Group and the Board determined
that the FY24 short term incentive would be set by reference to the
Group’s underlying EBITDA growth, aligning the incentive with a key
financial metric reported to shareholders. The long term incentive
continues to be assessed on the three year EPS growth achieved by
the Group.

Table 5 of the remuneration report details the realised
remuneration of the CEO in FY24 and Table 8 provides detail of
the CEO remuneration structure. Table 6 of the report outlines the
current and historical performance of the Group in more detail.

Executive Remuneration Framework
In order to drive sustainable business performance and to execute
its strategic plan, EBOS must attract and retain people of a high
calibre. Accordingly, executive remuneration is set with regard to
this and other key business objectives, including encouraging a
long-term commitment to EBOS Group.

EBOS aligns components of executive remuneration with the
performance of EBOS (pay-for-performance alignment).
As such, executive remuneration comprises fixed and ‘at risk’
(or performance-based) elements which are both short and
long-term in nature. The purpose of this structure is to ensure
that the interests of the executives, EBOS and its shareholders
are aligned during the period over which the business results are
realised (stakeholder alignment).

and its employees to pay everyone fairly for the value of the work

EBOS adopts an objective, robust and market-competitive system          a. Summary
to determine the remuneration levels of roles at EBOS based on the
                                                                        The Group’s Executive Remuneration Framework is a transparent
job requirements, skills and experience, and knowledge required
                                                                        structure comprising three elements.
of a fully competent job incumbent without bias. This approach is
also flexible enough to ensure that EBOS is able to recruit, develop
and retain a highly qualified workforce. The Remuneration Policy
is reinforced by EBOS’ Values and Leadership Standards which
recognises the Group’s overarching commitments to safety,
diversity, respect, sustainability, ethical behaviour and appropriate
risk management. Attracting, developing and retaining people of a
high calibre is critical to support sustainable business performance
and execution of strategy, and the remuneration of directors and
executives is set having regard to this.

Executive remuneration is benchmarked having regard
 to comparably sized companies to EBOS on the ASX.
The benchmarking also has regard to the evolving complexity
in the EBOS business with EBOS operating across a number of
geographies (New Zealand, Australia, Southeast Asia and the
United States) and sectors, the requirements of the individual
position and relevant internal and external pay relativities.

The remuneration framework is structured to promote the long-
term sustainable growth of the Group with a significant portion of
performance-based executive remuneration awarded as rights
to equity to reinforce alignment with the interests of EBOS and
its shareholders over this period. In this way, executive pay-for-
performance is aligned with stakeholder (including shareholder)
experience over the longer term.

Section 2: Remuneration Governance
As set out in the Charter for the Remuneration Committee, the
Committee is responsible for reviewing, recommending and,
if delegated by the Board, setting, in accordance with EBOS’
Remuneration Policy and practices, all components of the
remuneration of the directors and executives. The charter for the
Remuneration Committee is available on EBOS’ website:
https://www.ebosgroup.com/who-we-are/corporate-governance.

b. Short-Term Incentive (STI) Plan

Table 2: FY24 STI plan


 Feature                     Approach

 Purpose                     Aligns individual performance and behaviours with the Board-approved strategic and financial objectives of
                             EBOS for a financial year.

                             Provide individuals with a competitive market position for total cash reward (i.e. variable and fixed pay
                             components).


 Instrument                  Cash.

 Performance Criteria        The performance measures for the STI are set by reference to the executive’s responsibilities and particular
                             projects relevant to that executive and the business or function for which they are responsible.

                             The following criteria must be met before any payments are made:

                             • Group financial performance measures for the financial year; and
                             • for those with business unit responsibilities business unit EBITDA targets for the financial year.

                             For the FY23 STIs paid during FY24, Group financial performance was measured by reference to PBT.
                             For the FY24 STIs expected to be paid shortly after release of this report, Group financial performance was
                             measured by reference to Group underlying EBITDA.

                             The Board through the Remuneration Committee determines what the targets are for a financial year and
                             if these targets have been achieved. Targets are set having regard to the Board-approved budget for the
                             relevant year, with the overarching objective being that targets are achievable but sufficiently challenging.
                             This ensures targets also have regard to (as and when appropriate) significant transformative acquisitions that
                             are projected to impact upcoming year performance.

                             The FY24 STI for the Executive Leadership Team included a stretch incentive to explicitly incentivise and
                             reward outperformance by EBOS.

                             In line with the Board’s expectation that Management is accountable for a range of activities, including
                             implementation of sustainability and health & safety initiatives, the Board also has the flexibility to consider
                             non-financial STI performance measures and award Short-Term Incentive payments for special, strategically
                             important and/or transformative projects. The Board separately oversees key activities and initiatives of
                             management (including in relation to sustainability and health & safety). The Board is currently of the view that
                             financial metrics remain appropriate for an organisation of EBOS’ complexity and maturity however health
                             and safety leadership and progress in relation to the Group’s ESG program is factored into the determination
                             of the CEO STI outcome. In FY25 there are plans to introduce a Workplace Health and Safety Index as part of
                             the assessment of the STI.

 Board discretion and        The Board has discretion as to if an STI will operate for a financial year and who participates in the STI.
 Clawback
                             The payment of an STI to a participant is conditional upon the participant’s overall performance and
                             behaviours being satisfactory.

                             The Board has discretion to clawback or adjust an STI award to ensure a participant does not derive an unfair
                             benefit, including where the participant:

                             • acts, or has acted, fraudulently or dishonestly or made a material misstatement on behalf of any Group
                                company;
                             • is in breach of any of their duties or obligations to any Group company (including a breach of their obligations
                                under their employment contract);
                             • has engaged in negligence or gross misconduct;
                             • has done an act which could reasonably be regarded to have contributed to material reputation damage to
                                any Group company; or
                             • is convicted of an offence or has a judgment entered against them in connection with the affairs of any Group

                               financial performance and share price.

                               Provide individuals with a competitive market position for total reward (i.e. variable and fixed pay components).

 Instrument                    Performance rights which are rights to acquire ordinary shares in EBOS for nil consideration.


 Performance period            Three years from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2026 (i.e. FY24-FY26)

 Performance Criteria          The performance criteria (vesting conditions) for executives are:

                               • continuous employment with the Group; and
                               • growth in EBOS’ earnings per share over the performance period must equal or exceed a specific
                                  compound annual growth percentage target.

                               The vesting conditions for the FY24 LTI includes a ‘stretch’ target for certain senior executives to incentivise
                               and reward outperformance by EBOS.

                               The performance criteria are assessed at the end of the 3 year performance period (with no retesting in
                               future periods).

                               The Board also has the flexibility to consider broader performance criteria, including capital efficiency and/
                               or non-financial objectives, and award Long-Term Incentive payments for special, strategically important
                               and/or transformative projects (to drive significant outperformance and retain key executives over the
                               relevant period). The Board is currently of the view that earnings per share remains an appropriate measure
                               to assess the medium-to-long term performance of EBOS and its executive team.


 Settlement                    If the Board determines that performance rights have vested it may determine with respect to each vested
                               right whether to:

                               • allot and issue, or transfer, shares to a participant (equity settle); and/or

                               • pay a cash amount to a participant equivalent to the ‘market value’ of a share as at the date of vesting of
                                  the performance rights (cash settle). The market value of an EBOS share is calculated by reference to the
                                  volume weighted average price of EBOS shares on the NZX for the 5 trading days immediately prior to the
                                  date that the Board determines the rights have vested.


 Dividends and voting          Performance rights do not have voting rights or accrue dividends.

                               • is in breach of any of their duties or obligations to any Group company (including a breach of their

 Feature                     Approach

 Restriction on hedging      Hedging of performance rights by executives is prohibited under the plan rules and EBOS’ Securities Trading
                             Policy.


 Change of control           Vesting of performance rights is subject to Board discretion.

 Cessation of employment     Resignation: subject to the Board determining otherwise, unvested performance rights are forfeited.

                             Termination for cause: if an executive’s employment is terminated for cause, subject to the Board
                             determining otherwise, unvested and vested performance rights are forfeited.

                             Termination without cause (including circumstances such as redundancy and retirement): the Board shall
                             determine the treatment of unvested performance rights. All vested performance rights remain on foot
                             unless otherwise determined by the Board.

*The VWAP used was the 5 trading day VWAP on NZX at the time of payment multiplied by the then current AUD/ NZD exchange rate.


The full vesting of the performance rights is as a result of the achievement of the EPS performance hurdles for the three year performance
period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2023, reinforcing alignment with shareholder value creation over this period.

FY22 LTI (to vest in FY25)

In relation to the 94,124 performance rights issued in respect of the performance period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2024 (FY2022 LTI),
it is expected that all of these performance rights will vest shortly after the release of the annual report as the three year EPS CAGR
performance condition has been achieved.

FY24 LTI (granted in FY24)

The performance conditions for the performance rights granted during FY24 (FY24 LTI) are described in Table 3 above. There was no
change to the maximum LTI for Mr. Cullity in granting the FY24 LTI. Accordingly, the maximum LTI in the form of equity instruments for
Mr Cullity, which is inclusive of a stretch component, is $2,850,000. The performance period is 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2026. Accordingly,
these rights remain unvested as at 30 June 2024 and the vesting conditions will be tested following the conclusion of the FY26 financial year.

the Group’s results for FY23, less the FY23 final dividend.



FY25 LTI (granted in FY25)

The performance conditions for the performance rights granted during FY25 (FY25 LTI) are described in Table 3 above. There was no
change to the maximum LTI for Mr. Cullity in granting the FY25 LTI. Accordingly, the maximum LTI in the form of equity instruments for
Mr Cullity, which is inclusive of a stretch component, is $2,850,000. The performance period is 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027. Accordingly, these

Section 5: Non-Executive Director Remuneration

To support the attraction and retention of directors of the highest calibre and requisite expertise from New Zealand, Australia and
internationally, the Group aims to set remuneration of non-executive directors having regard to:

• the time commitment and responsibilities of the non-executive directors (including any commitment as a member of a standing or ad hoc
   Board committee and special exertion for significant project work outside of the normal workload for the Board and Committees); and

• market rates for non-executive director remuneration for comparable companies (by size, industry classification and complexity).
   The Board has regard to this as part of its succession planning and the attraction and retention of directors from, or with experience in,
   key geographic markets in which the Group operates, including Australia and Southeast Asia.

Non-executive director remuneration is in the form of fees. Non-executive directors do not receive performance-based or equity-based
remuneration.

Total remuneration for non-executive directors is subject to an aggregate fee pool limit of NZ$1,643,250 (including payments made in
respect of KiwiSaver and compulsory superannuation contributions) in any financial year. The fee pool was approved by shareholders at the
Annual Meeting held on 24 October 2023. The table below sets out the current fee allocations for director fees by position.




                                                                                                                                            103
