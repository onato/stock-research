     consolidated financial      assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and ISAs (NZ)
     statements                  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
                                 error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be

                                                                                                                                          Revenue from external customers (A$’000)
          date. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in the
          income statement.
          Tangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs).
          The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of future cash
          flows expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).

         Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the shareholders of the company by the                       in use. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is first allocated
         weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the year excluding shares held as treasury stock.                               to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis.
         Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares in determining the denominator.                    Any impairment loss on goodwill is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.

Goodwill arising on acquisition

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the LMT Group because the cost of acquisition included a control premium paid. In addition,
goodwill resulted from the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above the current fair value of
the assets acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are not
recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably measured and they do
not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.

The LMT Group was acquired as it is a profitable Australasian medical device business which the Group believes fits strategically
with its Australasian healthcare business assets.

Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group for the period ended 30 June 2020

The LMT Group contributed $1,124,000 to the Group profit for the period. Group revenue for the period includes $26,442,000 in

respect of the LMT Group. Had the LMT Group acquisition been effective at 1 July 2019, the revenue of the Group from continuing
operations would have been $8,774,944,000 and the profit for the period would have been $161,640,000.

         An associate is an entity over which EBOS has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a
         joint venture or joint operation. EBOS has significant influence when it has the power to participate in the financial and
         operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not in control or joint control over those policies.

         Investments in associates are incorporated in the Group’s financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
         Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted
         for post-acquisition changes in EBOS’ share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of
         individual investments and less any dividends. Losses of an associate in excess of EBOS’ interest in that associate are
         recognised only to the extent that EBOS has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of
         the associate.

         Any excess of the cost of acquisition over EBOS’ share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
