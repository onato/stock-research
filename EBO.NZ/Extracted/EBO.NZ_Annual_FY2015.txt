     We are confident that our businesses
     are well positioned for the future.
     None of our achievements in the past
     year would have been possible without
     our outstanding employees across all
     areas of EBOS. They understand and
     are proud of the essential role they
     play in health, and they embody our
     organisation’s promise of ‘Life Matters’.
     We are excited by the opportunities to
     expand our businesses on both sides
     of the Tasman in the years ahead.
     We believe the diversity of EBOS
     provides the benefits of a broad-
     based foundation and we have the
     agility to predict and respond quickly
     to opportunities as they arise.

 Independent Auditor’s Report
 TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EBOS GROUP LIMITED



 REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of EBOS Group Limited and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) on pages 23-59,
 which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2015, and the consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income,
 statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
 explanatory information.

 This report is made solely to the company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
 shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
 we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company’s shareholders as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
 opinions we have formed.

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 The Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with New Zealand
 Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and generally accepted accounting practice in New
 Zealand, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
 are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES

 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
 International Standards on Auditing and International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Those standards require that we comply with ethical
 requirements, and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from
 material misstatement.

 An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The
 procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
 statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
 and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
 for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
 of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
 statements.

 We believe that the audit evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

 Other than in our capacity as auditor and the provision of due diligence, financial modelling and information technology advisory assistance, we have
 no relationship with, or interests in EBOS Group Limited, or any of its subsidiaries. These services have not impaired our independence as auditor of
 the Company and Group.

 OPINION

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 23-59 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EBOS Group
 Limited and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2015, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New
 Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and generally accepted accounting
 practice in New Zealand.

     In determining the recoverability of trade and other receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the
     date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
     Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

     The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected
     liquidation proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The net carrying amount is considered to approximate its fair value.

(i) Financial asset carried at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).

(ii) Designated and effective as cash flow hedging instrument carried at fair value.

The Group has categorised these derivatives, both financial assets (as above) and financial liabilities (refer to Note 20), as Level 2 under the fair
value hierarchy contained within NZ IFRS 13.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs include observable forward
exchange rates, at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to present values.

Interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs for the valuation of interest rate swaps are the estimated future
cash flows based on observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various
counterparties. There have been no changes in valuation techniques used for either forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps
during the current reporting period. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

Allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following cash generating units or groups of cash generating units, representing
the lowest level at which management monitors goodwill:

• Australian Hospital, Pharmacy and Primary Healthcare sectors: Healthcare Australia.
• New Zealand Consumer, Hospital, Primary Healthcare, Aged Care and International Product Supplies: Healthcare NZ.
• New Zealand Pharmacy Wholesaler and Logistic Services: Healthcare - Pharmacy/Logistics NZ.
• New Zealand and Australia Animal Care sectors: Animal Care.

The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash generating units is as follows:
                                                                                                                                    2015           2014

During the year ended 30 June 2015, management has determined that there is no impairment of any of the cash-generating units containing
goodwill (2014: Nil).

During the year, the Group undertook a reorganisation of its internal reporting structure, combining its Animal Care operations acquired from
previous acquisitions. Consequently, goodwill that was previously allocated to its Animal Care New Zealand and Australian operations has now
been allocated to a combined cash-generating unit on a consistent basis with this new structure. Comparative figures have also been restated for
comparability purposes.

The recoverable amounts (i.e. higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) of those units are determined on the basis of value in use
calculations. Management has determined that the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes in the following assumptions:

• Market shares during the assessment period are assessed by management based on average market shares achieved in the period immediately
  before the start of the budget period, adjusted each year for any anticipated growth.

• Gross margins during the assessment period are estimated by management based on average gross margins achieved before the start of the
  assessment period, adjusted for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

• Operating costs during the assessment period are estimated by management based on current trends at the start of the assessment period,
  adjusted for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

The value in use calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period and
management’s past experience.

Annual growth rates of 1.7% to 7.0% (2014: 0.9% to 4.6%), an allowance of 1.8% to 7.0% (2014: 1.0% to 4.5%) for increases in expenses, and pre-tax
discount rates of 12.6% to 13.7% (2014: 12.7% to 13.7%) have been applied to these projections. Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been
extrapolated using a 2.5% (2014: 2.0% to 2.5%) growth rate. Management also believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying amount of any of the cash-generating units to exceed their recoverable amount.

     Management has assessed these assets as having an indefinite useful life. In coming to this conclusion, management considered expected expansion
     of the usage of the brands across other products and markets, the typical product life cycle of these assets, the stability of the industry in which the
     brands are operating, the level of maintenance expenditure required and the period of legal control over the brands and trademarks.

     During the current year, management has determined that there is no impairment of any of the brands and trademarks (2014: Nil).

     The calculation of the recoverable amounts for indefinite life intangibles have been determined based on a value in use calculation that uses cash
     flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.

     Management has determined that the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to change in the following assumptions: Annual growth
     rates of 1.7% to 5.9% (2014: 1.4% to 3%), and an allowance of 1.8% to 5.9% (2014: 1.4% to 3%) for increases in expenses, and pre-tax discount rates of
     13.1% to 17.9% (2014: 13.1% to 19.2%) have been applied to these projections. Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using a
     2.5% (2014: 2% to 2.5%) growth rate. Management also believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the
     carrying amount of the brands to exceed their recoverable amount.

     (i) The Group has bank term loans and revolving cash advance facilities of $364.5m (2014: $361.2m), of which $91.7m was unutilised at 30 June 2015
         (2014: $87.6m). The Group was released from a negative pledge deed in favour of the Group’s syndicated banks on 31 October 2014, when the
         significant provisions of the negative pledge deed, including the guarantee over the Group’s assets, were incorporated in an updated facilities
         agreement.

            There have been no breaches of the banking covenants.

     (ii) The Group, through a subsidiary company, has a trade debtor securitisation facility of $430.9m (2014: $450.3m) of which $277.7m was unutilised
          at 30 June 2015 (2014: $319.7m). The securitisation facility involves Symbion Pty Limited providing security over the future cash flows of specific
          trade receivables of Symbion Pty Limited, which meet certain criteria, in return for cash finance on a contracted percentage of the security
          provided. As recourse, in the event of default by a trade debtor, remains with Symbion Pty Limited the trade receivables provided as security and
          the funding provided are recognised on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

            At 30 June 2015, the value of trade receivables provided as security under this securitisation facility was $197.9m (2014: $180.3m). The net cash
            flows associated with the securitisation programme are disclosed in the cash flow statement as cash flows from financing activities.

            The Symbion Pharmacy Services Trade Receivables Trust (“SPS Trust”), which is consolidated, was established solely for the purpose of
            purchasing qualifying trade receivables from Symbion Pty Limited and funding the same from lenders. The SPS Trust has directly provided
            funding to Symbion Pty Limited to acquire the rights to the cash flows of the securitised receivables. The SPS Trust is consolidated as the Group
            has the exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the Trust and the Group considers that it has existing rights that give it
            the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the Trust.

     (iii) Secured by the assets leased.

     The fair value of non-current borrowings is approximately equal to their carrying amount.

     As at 30 June 2015 the Group maintains the following lines of credit:
                                                                                                                              Amount (NZD)

Operating leases

Leasing arrangements
Operating leases relate to certain property and equipment, with lease terms of between one to fifteen years with options to extend for a further one
to twenty years. All operating lease contracts contain market review clauses in the event that the Group exercises its option to renew. The Group
does not have an option to purchase the leased asset at the expiry of the lease period.

     Fully paid ordinary shares carry one vote per share and carry the right to dividends.

     Changes to the Companies Act in 1993 abolished the authorised capital and par value concept in relation to share capital from 1 July,
     1994. Therefore, the company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital and issued shares do not have a par value.

     3. To recognise additional liabilities identified as part of the acquisition.


     Goodwill arising on acquisition

     Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Blackhawk Premium Pet Care Pty Limited (“Blackhawk”) because the cost of acquisition included a control
     premium paid. In addition, the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows was above the current fair value of the assets acquired
     and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the
     expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.

     Blackhawk was acquired as it is a profitable premium animal food business which the Group believes fits strategically with its Animal Care
     business assets.

     Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group

     Blackhawk contributed $3,200,000 to the Group profit for the year. Group revenue for the year includes $17,732,000 in respect of Blackhawk. Had
     the Blackhawk acquisition been effective at 1 July 2014, the revenue of the Group from continuing operations would have been $6,077,013,000, and
     the Group profit for the year from continuing operations would have been $107,404,000.

A subsidiary company (PRNZ Limited) is guarantor for certain loans made to pharmacies by the ANZ National Bank Limited amounting to $3.691m
(2014: $5.273m). The Directors are of the opinion that provisions are not required in respect of these matters, as it is not probable that a future
sacrifice of economic benefits will be required.

A performance bond of up to $Nil (2014: $1m) was also held by the bank on behalf of a supplier, as was a performance guarantee of $0.585m (2014:
$0.529m).

Property lease guarantees of $8.155m (2014: $8.428m) are held by the bank on behalf of landlords of the Group.

Also refer to Note 17 for details of the Group’s borrowing facilities.

     31. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     (a) Financial risk management objectives

     The Group’s corporate treasury function provides services to the Group’s entities, co-ordinates access to financial markets, and manages the financial
     risks relating to the operation of the Group.

     The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. The use of
     financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial
     derivatives. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a regular basis.

     (b) Market risk

     The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group enters into
     a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:

     • forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on imports of product; and

     • interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.

     (c) Foreign currency risk management

     The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate
     exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

     Forward foreign exchange contracts

     The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated future sales and purchase transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies in accordance with the Group’s Board approved treasury policy.

     The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs include the forward exchange
     rates at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to present values.

     Therefore, the Group has categorised these derivatives as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy contained within NZ IFRS 13.

     There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

     (d) Interest rate risk management

     The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts.

     Interest rate swap contracts

     Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on
     agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt held. The fair value of
     interest rate swaps are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the reporting date.

                                                                         Average contracted

     The fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding are recognised as other financial assets/liabilities. Hedge accounting has been adopted. Interest
     rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs for the valuation of interest rate swaps are the estimated future cash flows
     based on observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various counterparties.

     Therefore, the Group has categorised these derivatives as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy contained within NZ IFRS 13. There were no transfers
     between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

     (e) Liquidity

     The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve banking facilities by continuously monitoring
     forecast and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

     The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and financial liabilities at balance date. The tables have
     been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of the financial assets and liabilities. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

(g) Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has
adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the
risk of financial loss from defaults.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse sectors and geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is
performed on the financial condition of the trade receivables.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represents the Group’s maximum
exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.

The maximum credit risk associated with guarantees provided by the Group is disclosed in Note 28.

The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any Group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned
by international credit rating agencies.

(h) Fair value of financial instruments

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements approximates
their fair values.

The fair values and net fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

• the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined
  with reference to quoted market prices;

• the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on
  discounted cash flow analysis; and

• the fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash
  flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments.

(i) Liquidity risk management

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

(j) Capital risk management

The Group manages its capital, meaning Total Shareholders’ Funds, to ensure that each entity within the Group will be able to continue as a going
concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity. The Group has certain capital risk management
covenants under its negative pledge agreement with its bankers, such as retaining minimum shareholder funds. None of its banking covenants were
breached during the year. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2014.



32. EVENTS AFTER BALANCE DATE

Subsequent to year end, the Board has approved a final dividend to shareholders. For further details please refer to Note 23.

ADDITIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE INFORMATION continued

Waivers from the NZX and ASX Listing Rules

Waivers granted from the application of NZX and ASX Listing Rules are published on the Company’s website.

The terms of the Company’s admission to the ASX and ongoing listing requires the following disclosures:

1. The Company is not subject to Chapters 6, 6A, 6B and 6C of the Australian Corporations Act dealing with the acquisition of shares (including
   substantial holdings and takeovers).

2. Limitations on the acquisition of securities imposed under New Zealand law are as follows:

  (a) In general, securities in the Company are freely transferable and the only significant restrictions or limitations in relation to the acquisition of
      securities are those imposed by New Zealand laws relating to takeovers, overseas investment and competition.

  (b) The New Zealand Takeovers Code creates a general rule under which the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting rights in the Company or
      the increase of an existing holding of 20% or more of the voting rights of the Company can only occur in certain permitted ways. These include
      a full takeover offer in accordance with the Takeovers Code, an acquisition approved by an ordinary resolution, an allotment approved by an
      ordinary resolution, a creeping acquisition (in certain circumstances), or compulsory acquisition of a shareholder holding 90% or more of the
      shares.

  (c) The New Zealand Overseas Investment Act 2005 and Overseas Investment Regulations 2005 (New Zealand) regulate certain investments in
      New Zealand by overseas interests. In general terms, the consent of the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office is likely to be required where
      an ‘overseas person’ acquires shares in the Company that amount to 25% or more of the shares issued by the Company, or if the overseas
      person already holds 25% or more, the acquisition increases that holding.

  (d) The New Zealand Commerce Act 1986 is likely to prevent a person from acquiring shares in the Company if the acquisition would have, or
      would be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market.

Voting Rights

Shareholders may vote at a meeting of shareholders either in person or by Proxy, Attorney, or Representative. Where voting is by show of hands or
by voice every shareholder present, in person or representative has one vote.

In a poll every shareholder present, in person or by representative has one vote for each share.

Use of Cash and Cash Equivalents

In accordance with ASX Listing Rule 4.10.19, the Board has determined that the Company has used cash and cash equivalents that it had at the time
of its admission to the ASX in a way consistent with its business objectives from the period of its admission to the ASX on 3 December 2013 to 30
June 2015.
