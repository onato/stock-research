ProPharma, PWR, Healthcare

supporting causes close to its
staff members’ hearts.

The business donates to three not-for-
profit organisations in the healthcare
field, nominated by members of its
Advisory Board, each year.

Thirty-one groups in New Zealand have
benefited from this initiative since 1999,
including the Multiple Sclerosis Society
of New Zealand (MSNZ) which provides
ongoing support, education and
advocacy for people with MS and
their loved ones.

MSNZ National Manager, Amanda
Keefe, called last year’s cash
contribution a “fantastic and greatly
appreciated surprise” which helped
fund the development of free
educational resources for people
newly diagnosed with MS.

     Independent Auditor’s Report
     TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EBOS GROUP LIMITED



     REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of EBOS Group Limited and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) on pages 21–59,
     which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, and the consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income,
     statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
     explanatory information.

     This report is made solely to the company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
     shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
     law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company’s shareholders as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
     or for the opinions we have formed.

     BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The Board of Directors are responsible on behalf of the company for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
     statements, in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting
     Standards, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
     statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

     AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES

     Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
     with International Standards on Auditing and International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Those standards require that we comply with
     ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
     free from material misstatement.

     An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
     The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
     financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
     entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
     the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes
     evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, as well as the overall presentation
     of the consolidated financial statements.

     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

     Other than in our capacity as auditor and the provision of due diligence, advisory services and information technology services, we have no
     relationship with or interests in EBOS Group Limited or any of its subsidiaries. These services have not impaired our independence as auditor
     of the Company and Group.

     OPINION

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 21 to 59 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EBOS Group
     Limited and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New
     Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.

In determining the recoverability of trade and other receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and
unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of
the expected liquidation proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The net carrying amount is considered to
approximate its fair value.

     (i) Financial asset carried at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).

     (ii) Designated and effective as cash flow hedging instrument carried at fair value.

     The Group has categorised these derivatives, both financial assets (as above) and financial liabilities (refer to Note 20), as Level 2 under the fair
     value hierarchy contained within NZ IFRS 13.

     The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs include observable forward
     exchange rates, at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to present values.

     Interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs for the valuation of interest rate swaps are the estimated future
     cash flows based on observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various
     counterparties. There have been no changes in valuation techniques used for either forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps
     during the current reporting period. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

     representing the lowest level at which management monitors goodwill:

     • Australian Hospital, Pharmacy and Primary Healthcare sectors: Healthcare Australia.
     • New Zealand Consumer, Hospital, Primary Healthcare, Aged Care and International Product Supplies: Healthcare NZ.
     • New Zealand Pharmacy Wholesaler and Logistic Services: Healthcare - Pharmacy/Logistics NZ.

     During the year ended 30 June 2016 management has determined that there is no impairment of any of the cash-generating units containing
     goodwill (2015: Nil).

     The recoverable amounts (i.e. higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) of those units are determined on the basis of value in use
     calculations. Management has determined that the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes in the following assumptions:

      • Revenue during the assessment period is estimated by management based on revenue achieved in the period immediately before the start
         of the assessment period, adjusted each year for any anticipated growth.

      • Gross margins during the assessment period are estimated by management based on average gross margins achieved before the start of
         the assessment period, adjusted for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

      • Operating costs during the assessment period are estimated by management based on current trends at the start of the assessment
         period, adjusted for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

     The value in use calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a five year period and
     managements past experience.

     Annual growth rates of 1.9% to 7.0% (2015: 1.7% to 7.0%), an allowance of 2.8% to 7.0% (2015: 1.8% to 7.0%) for increases in expenses, and pre-tax
     discount rates of 12.7% to 14.3% (2015: 12.6% to 13.7%) have been applied to these projections. Cash flows beyond the five year period have been
     extrapolated using a 2.5% (2015: 2.5%) growth rate. Management also believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions
     would not cause the carrying amount of any of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units to exceed their recoverable amount.

Management has assessed these assets as having an indefinite useful life. In coming to this conclusion, management considered expected
expansion of the usage of the brands across other products and markets, the typical product life cycle of these assets, the stability of the
industry in which the brands are operating, the level of maintenance expenditure required and the period of legal control over the brands
and trademarks.

During the current year, management has determined that there is no impairment of any of the brands and trademarks (2015: Nil).

The calculation of the recoverable amounts for indefinite life intangibles have been determined based on a value in use calculation that uses
cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.

Management has determined that the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to change in the following assumptions. Annual growth
rates of 2.2% to 7.0% (2015: 1.7% to 5.9%), an allowance of 2.8% to 7.0% (2015: 1.8% to 5.9%) for increases in expenses, and pre-tax discount rates
of 13.3% to 17.9% (2015: 13.1% to 17.9%) have been applied to these projections. Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated
using a 2.5% (2015: 2.5%) growth rate. Management also believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause
the carrying amount of the brands to exceed their recoverable amount.

(i) The Group has bank term loans and revolving cash advance facilities of $346.0m (2015: $364.5m), of which $85.3m was unutilised at 30 June
     2016 (2015: $91.7m). The Group was released from a negative pledge deed in favour of the Group’s syndicated banks on 31 October 2014 when
     the significant provisions of the negative pledge deed, including the guarantee over the Group’s assets, were incorporated in an updated
     facilities agreement.

   There have been no breaches of the banking covenants.

(ii) The Group, through a subsidiary company, has a trade debtor securitisation facility of $444.3m (2015: $430.9m) of which $337.3m was
      unutilised at 30 June 2016 (2015: $277.7m). The securitisation facility involves Symbion Pty Limited providing security over the future
      cash flows of specific trade receivables of Symbion Pty Limited, which meet certain criteria, in return for cash finance on a contracted
      percentage of the security provided. As recourse, in the event of default by a trade debtor, remains with Symbion Pty Limited the trade
      receivables provided as security and the funding provided are recognised on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

   At 30 June 2016, the value of trade receivables provided as security under this securitisation facility was $148.4m (2015: $197.9m).
   The net cash flows associated with the securitisation programme are disclosed in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as cash
   flows from financing activities.

   The Symbion Pharmacy Services Trade Receivables Trust (“SPS Trust”), which is consolidated, was established solely for the purpose
   of purchasing qualifying trade receivables from Symbion Pty Limited and funding the same from lenders. The SPS Trust has directly
   provided funding to Symbion Pty Limited to acquire the rights to the cash flows of the securitised receivables. The SPS Trust is
   consolidated as the Group has the exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the Trust and the Group
   considers that it has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the Trust.

(iii) Secured by the assets leased.

The fair value of non-current borrowings is approximately equal to their carrying amount.

As at 30 June 2016 the Group maintains the following lines of credit:

Goodwill arising on acquisition

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the business operations of Red Seal because the cost of acquisition included a control premium paid.
In addition, the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above the current fair value of the assets acquired and the
expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the
expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.

Red Seal was acquired as it is a profitable healthcare business which the Group believes fits strategically with its Australasian Retail Services
business assets.

Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group

Red Seal contributed $1,431,000 to the Group profit for the period. Group revenue for the period includes $24,101,000 in respect of
Red Seal. Had the Red Seal acquisition been effective at 1 July 2015, the revenue of the Group from continuing operations would have
been $7,119,485,000 and the profit for the period from continuing operations would have been $128,556,000.

     Goodwill arising on acquisition

     Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Blackhawk Premium Pet Care Pty Limited (“Blackhawk”) because the cost of acquisition included a control
     premium paid. In addition, the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows was above the current fair value of the assets
     acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are not recognised separately from
     goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable
     intangible assets.

     Blackhawk was acquired as it is a profitable premium animal food business which the Group believes fits strategically with its Animal Care
     business assets.

     Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group for the year ended June 30 2015

     Blackhawk contributed $3,200,000 to the Group profit for the year. Group revenue for the year includes $17,732,000 in respect of
     Blackhawk. Had the Blackhawk acquisition been effective at 1 July 2014, the revenue of the Group from continuing operations would
     have been $6,077,013,000, and the Group profit for the year from continuing operations would have been $107,404,000.

     31. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     (a) Financial risk management objectives

     The Group’s corporate treasury function provides services to the Group’s entities, co-ordinates access to financial markets, and manages
     the financial risks relating to the operation of the Group.

     The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
     The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles
     on the use of financial derivatives. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a regular basis.

     (b) Market risk

     The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
     The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:

     • forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on imports of product; and

     • interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.

     (c) Foreign currency risk management

     The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
     Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

     Forward foreign exchange contracts

     The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated future sales and purchase
     transactions denominated in foreign currencies in accordance with the Group’s Board approved treasury policy.

     The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs include the
     forward exchange rates at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to present values.

     Therefore, the Group has categorised these derivatives as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy contained within NZ IFRS 13.

     There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

     (d) Interest rate risk management

     The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts.

     Interest rate swap contracts

     Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated
     on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt held. The fair
     value of interest rate swaps is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the reporting date.

                                                                      Average contracted

     The fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding is recognised as other financial assets/liabilities. Hedge accounting has been adopted.
     Interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs for the valuation of interest rate swaps are the estimated
     future cash flows based on observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of
     the various counterparties.

     Therefore, the Group has categorised these derivatives as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy contained within NZ IFRS 13. There were no
     transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

     (e) Liquidity

     The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve banking facilities by continuously monitoring
     forecast and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

     The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and financial liabilities at balance date. The tables
     have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of the financial assets and liabilities. The table includes both interest and principal
     cash flows.

     (f) Sensitivity analysis

     (i) Interest rate sensitivity analysis

     The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for financial instruments at the balance date.
     The analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the financial instrument outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for
     the whole year.

     The impact to Profit for the Year and Total Equity as a result of a 100 basis point movement in interest rates is as follows:


                                                                                                                                       2016           2015

     (ii) Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

     The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase or decrease in the foreign currency rate against the presentation currency of
     the Group. The sensitivity analysis below is determined on exposure to outstanding foreign currency contracts and foreign currency monetary
     items, and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in
     profit and equity where the functional currency weakens 10% against the relevant currency.

31. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued

(g) Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group
has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit-worthy counter parties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of
mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse sectors and geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation
is performed on the financial condition of the trade receivables.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represents the Group’s maximum
exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.

The maximum credit risk associated with guarantees provided by the Group are disclosed in Note 28.

The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counter party or any Group of counter parties having similar
characteristics. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter parties are banks with high
credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

(h) Fair value of financial instruments

The directors consider that the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements approximates
their fair values.

The fair values and net fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

• the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined
   with reference to quoted market prices;
• the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based
   on discounted cash flow analysis; and
• the fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available use is made of discounted
   cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments.

(i) Liquidity risk management

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

(j) Capital risk management

The Group manages its capital, meaning Total Shareholders’ Funds, to ensure that each entity within the Group will be able to continue as
a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity. The Group has certain capital
risk management covenants under its negative pledge agreement with its bankers, such as retaining minimum shareholder funds. None of its
banking covenants were breached during the year. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2015.




32. EVENTS AFTER BALANCE DATE

Subsequent to year end, the Board has approved a final dividend to shareholders. For further details, please refer to Note 23.

On 4 August 2016 EBOS Group Limited announced it had entered into an agreement to merge its Chemmart business with the Terry White
Group businesses to create one of Australia’s largest retail pharmacy networks.

EBOS Group will sell the Chemmart business assets and subscribe for shares in Terry White Group Limited (TWG), which will result in
EBOS Group consolidating TWG in its financial statements from completion. The expected earnings impact is not material to EBOS Group.

Completion of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including TWG shareholder approval. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions, the transaction is expected to complete in late October 2016.

Waivers from the NZX and ASX Listing Rules

Waivers granted from the application of NZX and ASX Listing Rules are published on the Company’s website.

The terms of the Company’s admission to the ASX and ongoing listing requires the following disclosures:

1. The Company is not subject to Chapters 6, 6A, 6B and 6C of the Australian Corporations Act dealing with the acquisition of shares (including
    substantial holdings and takeovers).

2. Limitations on the acquisition of securities imposed under New Zealand law are as follows:

 (a) In general, securities in the Company are freely transferable and the only significant restrictions or limitations in relation to the acquisition
      of securities are those imposed by New Zealand laws relating to takeovers, overseas investment and competition.

 (b) The New Zealand Takeovers Code creates a general rule under which the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting rights in the Company or
      the increase of an existing holding of 20% or more of the voting rights of the Company can only occur in certain permitted ways. These include
      a full takeover offer in accordance with the Takeovers Code, an acquisition approved by an ordinary resolution, an allotment approved by an
      ordinary resolution, a creeping acquisition (in certain circumstances), or compulsory acquisition of a shareholder holding 90% or more of
      the shares.

 (c) The New Zealand Overseas Investment Act 2005 and Overseas Investment Regulations 2005 (New Zealand) regulate certain investments
     in New Zealand by overseas interests. In general terms, the consent of the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office is likely to be required
     where an ‘overseas person’ acquires shares in the Company that amount to 25% or more of the shares issued by the Company, or if the
     overseas person already holds 25% or more, the acquisition increases that holding.

 (d) The New Zealand Commerce Act 1986 is likely to prevent a person from acquiring shares in the Company if the acquisition would have,
      or would be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market.

Voting Rights

or by voice every shareholder present in person or representative has one vote.
