Pharmacist, HPS Pharmacies
John Fawkner Oncology

The HPS Approved Pharmacy at John Fawkner Oncology looks after seven
hospitals across Victoria, each with their own unique requirements. Lydia Leong
supported the pharmacy team to navigate the challenges of the pandemic while
also guiding the unit through a period of significant change. The pharmacy’s
ability to adapt to this change and overhaul the site’s workflow and processes
during a pandemic was critical to ensuring they could continue to service their
customers and emerge as a more efficient and robust unit.

          passage of time is required before payment is made.

          The transaction price may be adjusted for customers who pay their account in full, earlier than what standard credit terms
          would require, or for incremental costs incurred in obtaining a sales contract which are recognised over the contractual
          period. Under the Group’s standard terms with customers, product returns, refunds and provision for warranties are in
          accordance with local requirements. Accumulated experience has been used to determine that such returns are not
          significant.

           The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of future cash
           flows expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the business operations of Cryomed and CH2 Vet because the cost of acquisition included a
control premium paid. In addition, goodwill resulted from the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above
the current fair value of the assets acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained.
These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably
measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.

Cryomed was acquired as it is a profitable Australasian medical device business which the Group believes fits strategically with its
Australasian healthcare business assets.

CH2 Vet was acquired as it is a profitable Australian animal care business which the Group believes fits strategically with its

Deferred consideration of $8.5m was recognised as future EBITDA earn out targets of the businesses acquired, on which the
consideration is payable, have, or are expected to be achieved.

The impact of the acquisitions on the results of the Group for the period ended 30 June 2021 are not considered material and are
therefore not disclosed in the financial statements.

          to the extent that EBOS has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

          Any excess of the cost of acquisition over EBOS’ share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
          contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included
          within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
