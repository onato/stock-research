Independent Auditor’s Report to the Shareholders
of EBOS Group Limited

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Opinion              We have audited the consolidated financial statements of EBOS Group Limited and its subsidiaries
                     (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2017, and the
                     consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in
                     equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial
                     statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

                     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 31 to 78, present
                     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2017,
                     and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended
                     in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (“NZ
                     IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

Basis for Opinion    We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) and
                     International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (“ISAs (NZ)”). Our responsibilities under those
                     standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
                     Financial Statements section of our report.

                     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
                     basis for our opinion.

                     We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised)
                     Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
                     Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
                     Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
                     these requirements.

                     Our firm carries out other assignments for the Group in the area of due diligence, advisory services
                     and information technology services. These services have not impaired our independence as
                     auditor of the Company and Group. In addition to this, partners and employees of our firm deal
                     with the Company and its subsidiaries on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading
                     activities of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. The firm has no other relationship
                     with, or interest in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Audit Materiality    We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial
                     statements of the Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic
                     decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’
                     materiality). In addition, we also assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the
                     audit would in our judgement change or influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’
                     materiality). We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the
                     results of our work.

                     We determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be $10m.

Key Audit Matters    Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance
                      in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were
                      addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in
                      forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
                                                                                                                                 27

We included the impairment assessments of goodwill
and indefinite life intangible assets as a key audit matter
due to the significance of the balances to the financial
statements and the level of judgement applied by the Group
in determining the key assumptions used to determine the
recoverable amounts.

         as appropriate.

         All significant inter-company transactions and
         balances are eliminated on consolidation.

 Foreign currency

         Functional currency

         The financial statements of each of the Group’s
         entities are measured using the currency of the
         primary economic environment in which that
         entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

         Transactions and balances

         Foreign currency transactions are translated into
         the functional currency using the exchange rate
         on the date of the transaction. At each balance
         sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
         denominated in foreign currencies are translated
         at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
         Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are
         measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
         currency are not retranslated.

         Exchange differences arising on the settlement
         of monetary items, and on the translation of
         monetary items, are included in the Consolidated
         Income Statement for the period.

         Foreign operations

         On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of
         EBOS’ overseas operations are translated at the
         exchange rate at the reporting date. Income and
         expense items are translated at the average rates
         for the period. Exchange differences arising are
         recognised in the foreign currency translation
         reserve (in equity) and recognised in profit or
         loss on disposal of the foreign operation.

         Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the
         acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
         and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated
         at the exchange rate at the reporting date.

           RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
           Impairment
           EBOS reviews the recoverable amount of its tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, at each balance
           date. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in
           the income statement.
           Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating
           units). The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the present value of
           future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).
           Depreciation and amortisation
           Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land,
           at depreciation rates calculated to allocate the assets’ cost less estimated residual value, over their estimated
           useful lives. Refer to note D1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation.
           Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of finite life intangibles. Refer to
           note B1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of amortisation.
           Operating lease expenses
           EBOS leases certain land, buildings, plant and equipment. Operating leases are where the lessor rather than
           EBOS has effectively retained the substantial risk and benefit of ownership of a leased item. Operating lease
           payments are included in the determination of profit or loss in equal instalments over the period of the lease.
           Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
                                                                                                                            41




         Employee expenses
         Provision is made for benefits owing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service
         leave and employee incentives for services rendered. Provisions are recognised when it is probable they will be
         settled and can be measured reliably. They are carried at the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time
         of settlement and discounted to the present value of the expected payment to the employee at balance date.

         Net Finance costs
         Finance costs include bank interest and amortisation of costs incurred in connection with borrowings facilities.
         Finance costs are expensed immediately as incurred, using the effective interest rate method, unless they relate
         to acquisition and development of qualifying assets, in which case finance cost is capitalised.

         Interest income is recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest rate method.




                                                                                                                                 EBOS Group Limited | Annual Report 2017
         Dividend income
         Dividend income from investments is recognised when EBOS has the right to receive payment of the dividend.

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

         The reportable segments of EBOS have been identified in accordance with NZ IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.

         The Group’s operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group
         that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment
         and to assess its performance.

         The accounting policies of EBOS have been consistently applied to the operating segments. Profit before
         depreciation, amortisation, net finance costs and tax expense (EBITDA) is the measure reported to the chief
         operating decision-maker for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

         Assets are not allocated to operating segments as they are not reported to the chief operating decision-maker
         at a segment level.

          RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

          Income tax expense is the income tax assessed on taxable profit for the year.

          Taxable profit differs from profit before tax reported in the Consolidated Income Statement as it excludes items of
          income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years (temporary differences) and also excludes items
          that will never be taxable or deductible (permanent differences).

          Income tax expense components are current income tax and deferred tax.

 A3. TAXATION continued

         Deferred tax is income tax that is expected to be payable or recoverable in the future as a result of the unwinding
         of temporary differences. These arise from differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial
         reporting and for the filing of income tax returns.

         Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences, other than those arising:

         • from goodwill;

         • from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than in a business combination) that
            affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and

         • from investments in associates and subsidiaries where EBOS is able to control the reversal of the temporary
            differences and such differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

         Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when a liability is settled or an
         asset realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.

         A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to use the
         asset. This is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
         taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise the deferred tax asset.

          SECTION OVERVIEW

          This section identifies the balances and transactions to which key judgements have been made by EBOS in the
          preparation of these financial statements. Key judgements have been in regard to the estimates for future cash
          flows for goodwill impairment assessment purposes, and the identification of intangible assets and recognition
          of goodwill for business acquisitions.

        RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

        Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired
        (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount
        of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest
        (if any) in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets recognised.

        Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
        goodwill is allocated to each of EBOS’ cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units expected to
        benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are
        tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
        The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. If the recoverable amount of
        the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the
        carrying amount of any goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. Any impairment
        loss to goodwill is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.

         initially recognised at fair value. These intangible assets are tested annually for impairment on the same basis
         as for goodwill.

         JUDGEMENT: USEFUL LIVES OF INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

         The Directors have assessed these brands, trademarks and franchise network asset as having an indefinite useful
         life. In coming to this conclusion, the expected expansion of these assets across other products and markets, the
         typical product life cycle of these assets, the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, the level
         of maintenance expenditure required and the period of legal control over these assets has been considered.

For the year ended 30 June 2017, the Directors have determined that there is no impairment of any of the cash-generating
units containing goodwill, brands and trademarks (2016: Nil).

            KEY JUDGEMENT: IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT ASSUMPTION

            The recoverable amounts of cash generating units is determined on the basis of value in use calculations.
            The recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes in the following assumptions:

             Revenue              Estimated by management based on revenue achieved in the period immediately before
                                  the start of the assessment period and adjusted each year for any anticipated growth.

             Operating costs      Estimated by management based on current trends at the start of the assessment period
                                  and adjusted for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

             Discount rates       Estimated by management based on a current market assessment of the time value of
                                  money, cost of capital and risks specific to the asset to which the cash flows generated
                                  by that asset are being assessed.

        KEY ESTIMATE: VALUE IN USE CALCULATION

        The value in use calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by the Board
        and management covering a five year period, including terminal value, and management’s past experience.
        The following estimates were used in the value in use calculation:


                                                                                                 2017                    2016

        KEY ESTIMATE: FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL CALCULATION

        The fair value of indefinite life intangibles has been calculated using the relief from royalty method.
        The following estimates were used:

        Management have carried out a sensitivity analysis and believe that any reasonably possible change in the key
        assumptions would not cause the book value of any of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating
        units, to exceed their recoverable amount.

          RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

          Finite life intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on
          a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.

          JUDGEMENT: USEFUL LIVES OF FINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

          In determining the estimated useful life of finite life intangible assets (of a period of between 1 to 12 years) the
          following characteristics have been assessed: (i) expected expansion of the usage of the assets, (ii) the typical
          product life cycle of these assets, (iii) the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, and (iv) the
          level of maintenance expenditure required. The estimated useful life and amortisation period is reviewed at the
          end of each annual reporting period.

          ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          At each balance sheet date, EBOS reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether
          there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
          recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
          Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, EBOS estimates the
          recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

          Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
          estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
          current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
          estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

          If the recoverable amount of an asset (cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,
          the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment
          loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

          Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, other than for goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset
          (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that
          the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
          impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment
          loss is recognised as income immediately. Impairment losses cannot be reversed for goodwill.

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

         Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.

         The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given,
         liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by EBOS in exchange for control of the acquiree.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

         Where applicable, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
         arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted
         against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent
         changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in
         accordance with relevant NZ IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity
         are not recognised.
                                                                                                                                55




Goodwill arising on acquisition

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the business operations of TWG because the cost of acquisition included a control
premium paid. In addition, goodwill resulted from the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above
the current fair value of the assets acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained.
These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be
reliably measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.
TWG was acquired as it is a profitable healthcare business that the Group believes fits strategically with its existing
Australian healthcare business assets.

Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017

TWG contributed a profit of $1.179m to the Group profit for the year, this amount is inclusive of transaction costs incurred




                                                                                                                                     EBOS Group Limited | Annual Report 2017
by TWG attributable to the acquisition. Group revenue for the year includes $84.295m in respect of TWG. Had the TWG
acquisition been effective at 1 July 2016, the revenue of the Group from continuing operations would have been $7.655b
and the profit for the period would have been $133.616m.

In June 2017 the Group acquired the business assets of Alchemy Holdings Pty Ltd (‘HPS’). Details of the acquisition

 Subsequent to the acquisition of HPS and prior to balance date, $9.769m of the deferred consideration balance was
 settled. Due to the timing of the acquisition the above figures have not yet been able to be finalised and are currently
 considered provisional.

 Goodwill arising on acquisition

 Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the business operations of HPS because the cost of acquisition included a control
 premium paid. In addition, the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above the current fair value
 of the assets acquired and the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained. These benefits are
 not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be reliably measured
 and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.

 HPS was acquired as it is a profitable healthcare business that the Group believes fits strategically with its existing Australian
 healthcare business assets.

 Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017

 Due to the timing of the acquisition, HPS’ contribution to the Group’s revenue and profit for the year were immaterial.
 Had the HPS acquisition been effective at 1 July 2016, the revenue of the Group from continuing operations would have
 been $7.684b and the profit for the period would have been $135.221m.

            RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

            Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently carried at amortised
            cost. Allowances are made for estimated unrecoverable amounts (provision for doubtful debts) and these are
            recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The provision for doubtful debts is measured as the difference
            between the trade receivables carrying amount and expected present value of future cash flows, which has
            considered customer credit history and historical recovery performance and trends.

 (i) T
      rade receivables are non-interest bearing with credit accounts provided to customers on monthly terms. Interest may be
     charged on outstanding overdue balances in accordance with the terms and conditions under which goods are supplied.

 (ii) Ageing of impaired trade and other receivables

                                                                                            2017                           2016

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

         Inventories consist of raw materials (for the manufacturing operations of EBOS) and finished goods. Inventories are
         recognised at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis and net realisable value. Cost comprises
         direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing
         the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in
         the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
         and distribution.

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

         Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the original purchase consideration
         and those costs directly attributable to bringing the item of property, plant and equipment to the location and
         condition for its intended use. After recognition as an asset, property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less
         accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

         Depreciation of property, plant and equipment assets, other than freehold land, is calculated on a straight-line
         basis. This allocates the cost or fair value amount of an asset, less any residual value, over its estimated remaining
         useful life.

         JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES – USEFUL LIVES

         EBOS makes estimates of the remaining useful life of assets as follows:

         • Buildings: 20 to 50 years
         • Leasehold improvements: 2 to 15 years

(i) E
     BOS, through a subsidiary company, has a trade debtor securitisation facility of $447.0m (2016: $444.3m) of which
    $292.0m was unutilised at 30 June 2017 (2016: $337.3m). The securitisation facility involves providing security over the
    future cash flows of specific trade receivables, which meet certain criteria, in return for cash finance on a contracted
    percentage of the security provided. As recourse, in the event of default by a trade debtor, remains with EBOS the trade
    receivables provided as security and the funding provided are recognised on the EBOS Consolidated Balance Sheet.

  At 30 June 2017, the value of trade receivables provided as security under this securitisation facility was $198.9m
  (2016: $148.4m). The net cash flows associated with the securitisation program are disclosed in the Consolidated
  Cash Flow Statement as cash flows from financing activities.

 E3. BORROWINGS continued

 (ii) E
       BOS has bank term loans and revolving cash advance facilities of $450.4m (2016: $346.0m), of which $8.7m was
      unutilised at 30 June 2017 (2016: $85.3m).

     EBOS is in full compliance with its debt facility financial covenants. Bank loans are secured by a guarantee over the
     assets of EBOS.
             RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

             All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received plus
             issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, these loans and borrowings are subsequently
             measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method that allocates the cost through the expected life of
             the loan or borrowing. The fair value of non-current borrowings is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
             Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless EBOS has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
             liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

         An associate is an entity over which EBOS has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest
         in a joint venture or joint operation. EBOS has significant influence when it has the power to participate in the
         financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not in control or joint control over those policies.

         Investments in associates are incorporated in the EBOS Group financial statements using the equity method of
         accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
         at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in EBOS’ share of the net assets of the associate, less any
         impairment in the value of individual investments and less any dividends. Losses of an associate in excess of
         EBOS’ interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that EBOS has incurred legal or constructive
         obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.




                                                                                                                                      EBOS Group Limited | Annual Report 2017
         Any excess of the cost of acquisition over EBOS’ share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
         contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill
         is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.


SECTION G: HOW WE MANAGE RISK

           SECTION OVERVIEW

           This section describes the financial risks that EBOS has identified and how it manages these risks, to protect its
           financial position and financial performance. Management of these risks includes the use of financial instruments
           to hedge against unfavourable interest rate and foreign currency movements.


G1. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The EBOS corporate treasury function provides services to the Group’s entities, coordinates access to financial markets
and manages the financial risks relating to the operation of the Group.

EBOS does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by Group policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written
principles on the use of financial derivatives. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board of
Directors on a regular basis.

         FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

         EBOS is exposed to foreign currency risk arising primarily from the procurement of goods denominated in foreign
         currencies (US dollar, Thai Baht, Euro and British Pound).

Foreign exchange rate exposures are managed utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

EBOS enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated future purchase
transactions denominated in foreign currencies in accordance with the Board approved treasury policy.

         INTEREST RATE RISK

         EBOS is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds in both New Zealand dollars and Australian dollars at
         floating interest rates.
72




 G1. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued

 The risk is assessed and managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts.

 Under interest rate swap contracts, EBOS agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest
 amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable EBOS to mitigate the risk of changing
 interest rates on debt held.

 Interest rate swap contracts are only entered into in accordance with the Group’s Board approved treasury policy.

           LIQUIDITY RISK

           EBOS is exposed to liquidity risk as it must invest in significant levels of working capital such as inventory and
           accounts receivables that can impact liquidity unless they are converted to cash.

 EBOS manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve banking facilities by
 continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
 Refer to note E4 for information on EBOS’ borrowings facility maturity profile.

           CREDIT RISK

           EBOS is exposed to the risk of default in relation to receivables owing from its Healthcare and Animal Care
           customers, hedging instruments and guarantees and deposits held with banks and other financial institutions.

 EBOS has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counter parties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial
 loss from defaults.

 Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse sectors and geographical areas.
 Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the trade receivables.

 The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represents
 the maximum exposure to EBOS of any credit risk.

 EBOS does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counter party. The credit risk on liquid funds and
 derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by
 international credit rating agencies.

 EBOS has not changed its overall strategy regarding the management of risk from 2016.

(i) Designated and effective as a cash flow hedging instrument carried at fair value.

EBOS has categorised these derivatives, both financial assets and financial liabilities, as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy
contained within NZ IFRS 13. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs are
based upon observable forward exchange rates, at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to
present values.

Interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs for the valuation of interest rate swaps
are the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, discounted at
a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various counterparties.

 G2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued

        RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

        Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
        subsequently remeasured to their fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately
        unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the
        recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. EBOS designates certain derivatives
        as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.

        The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements approximates
        their fair values.

        The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

        • the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on
           active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices;

        • the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally
           accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis; and

        • the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available use
           is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments.

        CASH FLOW HEDGES

        Changes in fair value of hedges that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and are considered effective
        for accounting purposes are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve (in equity) and in other comprehensive
        income. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the income statement.
        Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled in the income statement in the periods when
        the forecast transactions (hedged item) take place.

        However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a
        non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and
        included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.

        Hedge accounting is discontinued when EBOS either revokes the hedging relationship or the hedging instrument
        expires or is terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts deferred in equity are
        recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.

        When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred
        in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 EBOS operates a long term incentive share plan whereby EBOS provides an interest free, non-recourse loan to participating
 senior executives in order for those executives to purchase shares in the company. While the shares are issued and held in
 the executive’s name the shares will not vest unless and until performance conditions are met. The executive cannot deal
 in the shares unless and until those shares vest. All net dividends received in respect of the shares must be applied to the
 repayment of the interest-free loan.

 A total of 600,000 shares were issued in September 2016 with an issue price of $18.15. The performance conditions in
 relation to these shares will be tested after the end of the performance period, being 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019.

 H6. CHANGES IN FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

 No new accounting standards or interpretations have been adopted during the year that have had a material impact on
 these financial statements. The following new standards have been approved but are not yet effective, which may have
 a future impact on the Group’s financial statements:

 NZ IFRS 16 Leases

 NZ IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including NZ IAS 17 leases and the related interpretations when it
 becomes effective for EBOS in the 2020 financial year.

 NZ IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
 Distinctions of operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting,
 and is replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by
 lessees (i.e., all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.

 The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less
 accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability
 is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease
 liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications.

 Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under NZ IAS 17 are
 presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the NZ IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal
 and an interest portion that will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.

 The new requirement to recognise a right-of use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have a significant impact
 on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the directors are currently assessing its
 potential impact. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the directors complete
 their review.

 NZ IFRS 9 Financial instruments

 NZ IFRS 9 establishes the principles for hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. Under NZ IFRS 9, greater
 flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting. In addition, the effectiveness test
 has been overhauled and replaced with the principle of an ‘economic relationship’. Retrospective assessment of hedge
 effectiveness is also no longer required. Enhanced disclosure requirements about an entity’s risk management activities
 have also been introduced. In relation to the impairment of financial assets NZ IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss
 model, as opposed to an incurred credit loss model under NZ IAS 39. The expected credit loss model requires an entity to
 account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes.
 This standard will be effective for EBOS in the 2019 financial year. While the Group has made progress in its assessment
 of the potential impact of this standard this process has not yet been completed.

 NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts

 NZ IFRS 15 provides a single, comprehensive principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
 This standard will be effective for EBOS in the 2019 financial year. The five steps in the model are: identify the contract with
 the customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction
 price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
 obligation. While the Group has made progress in its assessment of the potential impact of this standard this process has
 not yet been completed.

 We expect to report more detailed information on these not-yet-implemented standards, including estimated quantitative
 financial effects, in our 2018 financial statements.

     imitations on the acquisition of securities imposed under New Zealand law are as follows:

     (a) In general, securities in the Company are freely transferable and the only significant restrictions or limitations in
          relation to the acquisition of securities are those imposed by New Zealand laws relating to takeovers, overseas
          investment and competition.

         rights in the Company or the increase of an existing holding of 20% or more of the voting rights of the Company
         can only occur in certain permitted ways. These include a full takeover offer in accordance with the Takeovers
         Code, a partial takeover in accordance with the Takeovers Code, an acquisition approved by an ordinary resolution,
         an allotment approved by an ordinary resolution, a creeping acquisition (in certain circumstances), or compulsory

         to 25% or more of the shares issued by the Company, or if the overseas person already holds 25% or more, the
         acquisition increases that holding.

PRINCIPLE 8: REMUNERATE FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee,
the current members of which are Mark Waller, Elizabeth
Coutts and Sarah Ottrey. Mark Waller is the Chair of the
Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee’s
Charter which outlines the Committee’s authority, duties,
responsibility and relationship with the Board is set out
as Appendix C to the Corporate Governance Code and is
available on the Company’s website.

There were two Remuneration Committee meetings held
during the year which were attended by all then-current
members of the committee.

The Company’s policies and approach to remuneration
issues are outlined in section 10 of the Corporate
Governance Code.

EBOS operates a long term incentive share plan for senior
executives. Under the rules for the plan, a participating
executive must not enter into an arrangement with anyone,
including a derivative or hedging arrangement, if the
arrangement would have the effect of limiting the exposure
of the participant to risk relating to unvested shares.
