     independent auditor’s
     report to the shareholders

     Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
     Opinion             We have audited the consolidated financial statements of EBOS Group Limited and its
                         subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2018,
                         and the consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement
                         of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the
                         consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

                         In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 30 to 74, present
                         fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June
                         2018, and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in
                         accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards
                         (‘NZ IFRS’) and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’).

     Basis for Opinion   We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and
                         International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those
                         standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
                         Financial Statements section of our report.

                         We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
                         basis for our opinion.

                         We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1
                         (Revised) Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and
                         Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
                         Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
                         responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

                         Other than in our capacity as auditor and the provision of advisory services and taxation
                         services, we have no relationship with or interests in the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
                         These services have not impaired our independence as auditor of the Company and Group.

     Audit Materiality   We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the
                         financial statements of the Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the
                         economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced
                         (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also assess whether other matters that come to
                         our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or influence the decisions of such
                         a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit
                         work and in evaluating the results of our work.

                         We determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be $10.5m.

     Key Audit Matters   Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most
                         significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.
                         These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
                         statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
                         opinion on these matters.

     We included the identification and valuation of intangible
     assets and the allocation of goodwill to CGU’s for the
     Alchemy acquisition as a key audit matter because the
     Group’s acquisitions are considered a key area of interest for
     investors and because of the size of this acquisition and the
     level of intangible assets. There is also significant judgement
     involved in identifying the intangible assets acquired

Consolidated Financial      assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and ISAs (NZ)
Statements                  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
                            error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
                            expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated

        entities are measured using the currency of the
        primary economic environment in which that entity
        operates (the functional currency).

        Transactions and balances

        Foreign currency transactions are translated into
        the functional currency using the exchange rate




                                                                                                                                          Financials

        sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
        denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
        the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
        Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are
        measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
        currency are not retranslated.

        Exchange differences arising on the settlement of
        monetary items, and on the translation of monetary
        items, are included in the Consolidated Income

        Foreign operations

        On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of
        EBOS’ overseas operations are translated at the
        exchange rate at the reporting date. Income and
        expense items are translated at the average rates
        for the period. Exchange differences arising are
        recognised in the foreign currency translation
        reserve (in equity), and recognised in profit or loss
        on disposal of the foreign operation.

              RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

              Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts net of
              any returns and discounts. Revenue is recognised when it is considered probable that the economic benefits of
              the transaction will be received by EBOS. The following specific recognition criteria must be met before revenue is
              recognised:

               Sale of Goods                                                    Rendering of Services

          Impairment
          EBOS reviews the recoverable amount of its tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, at each balance
          date. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is recognised in the
          income statement.
          Tangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
          (cash-generating units). The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the
          present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (value in use).
          Depreciation and amortisation
          Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land,
          at depreciation rates calculated to allocate the assets’ cost less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful
          lives. Refer to note D1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation.
          Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of finite life intangibles. Refer to note
          B1 for the useful lives used in the calculation of amortisation.

          Operating lease expenses
          EBOS leases certain land, buildings, plant and equipment. Operating leases are where the lessor rather than EBOS
          have effectively retained the substantial risk and benefit of ownership of a leased item. Operating lease payments
          are included in the determination of profit or loss in equal instalments over the period of the lease. Lease incentives
          received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease period.

     A1. REVENUE AND EXPENSES continued
              Employee expenses
              Provision is made for benefits owing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave
              and employee incentives for services rendered. Provisions are recognised when it is probable they will be settled and
              can be measured reliably. They are carried at the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement and
              discounted to the present value of the expected payment to the employee at balance date.
              Net finance costs
              Finance costs include bank interest and amortisation of costs incurred in connection with borrowing facilities.
              Finance costs are expensed immediately as incurred, using the effective interest method, unless they relate to
              acquisition and development of qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised.
              Interest income is recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest method.

               RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

               The reportable segments of EBOS have been identified in accordance with NZ IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.

               The Group’s operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that
               are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to
               assess its performance.

               The accounting policies of EBOS have been consistently applied to the operating segments. Profit before
               depreciation, amortisation, net finance costs and tax expense (EBITDA) is the measure reported to the chief
               operating decision-maker for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

               Assets are not allocated to operating segments as they are not reported to the chief operating decision-maker
               at a segment level.

               RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

               Income tax expense is the income tax assessed on taxable profit for the year.

               Taxable profit differs from profit before tax reported in the Consolidated Income Statement as it excludes items of
               income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years (temporary differences) and also excludes items
               that will never be taxable or deductible (permanent differences).

               Income tax expense components are current income tax and deferred tax.

                                                                                                                                      Business
        Deferred tax is income tax that is expected to be payable or recoverable in the future as a result of the unwinding of
        temporary differences. These arise from differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
        and for the filing of income tax returns.

        Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences, other than those arising:

        • from goodwill;

        • from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than in a business combination)
           that affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and

        • investments in associates and subsidiaries where EBOS is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences
           and such differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.




                                                                                                                                                Financials
        Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when a liability is settled or an asset
        realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.

        A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to use the
        asset. This is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
        taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise the deferred tax asset.

     Section B: Key judgements made
                SECTION OVERVIEW

                This section identifies the balances and transactions to which key judgements have been made by EBOS in the
                preparation of these financial statements. Key judgements have been made with regard to the estimates for
                future cash flows for goodwill impairment assessment purposes, and the identification of intangible assets and
                recognition of goodwill for business acquisitions.

               RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

               Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired
               (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of
               any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest (if any)
               in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets recognised.

               Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
               goodwill is allocated to each of EBOS’ cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units expected to benefit
               from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for
               impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. The recoverable
               amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
               unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any
               goodwill and then to the other assets of the cash-generating unit on a pro-rata basis. Any impairment loss on
               goodwill is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

         Indefinite life intangible assets represent purchased brands, trademarks and a franchise network asset that are
         initially recognised at fair value. These intangible assets are tested annually for impairment on the same basis as
         for goodwill.
                                                                                                                                      & Disclosures

         JUDGEMENT: USEFUL LIVES OF INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

         The directors have assessed these brands, trademarks and a franchise network asset as having an indefinite useful
         life. In coming to this conclusion the expected expansion of these assets across other products and markets,
         the typical product life cycle of these assets, the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, the level
         of maintenance expenditure required and the period of legal control over these assets has been considered.

     For the year ended 30 June 2018, the directors have determined that there is no impairment of any of the cash-generating
     units containing goodwill, brands, trademarks and franchise network asset (2017: Nil).

                   KEY JUDGEMENT: IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT ASSUMPTION

                   The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units is determined on the basis of value in use calculations.
                   The recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes in the following assumptions:

                    Revenue                Estimated by management based on revenue achieved in the period immediately before
                                           the start of the assessment period and adjusted each year for any anticipated growth.

                    Operating costs        Estimated by management based on current trends at the start of the assessment period
                                           and adjusted for expected changes in the business or sector in which the business operates.

                    Discount rates         Estimated by management based on a current market assessment of the time value of
                                           money, cost of capital and risks specific to the asset to which the cash flows generated
                                           by that asset are being assessed.

             RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

             Finite life intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a
             straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.

             JUDGEMENT: USEFUL LIVES OF FINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

             In determining the estimated useful life of finite life intangible assets (of a period of between 1 to 12 years)
             the following characteristics have been assessed: (i) expected expansion of the usage of the assets, (ii) the typical
             product life cycle of these assets, (iii) the stability of the industry in which the assets are operating, and (iv) the level
             of maintenance expenditure required. The estimated useful life and amortisation period is reviewed at the end of
             each annual reporting period.

         ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         At each balance sheet date, EBOS reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine
         whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists,
         the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
         Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, EBOS estimates the
         recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

         Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
         the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects




                                                                                                                                           Financials
         current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates
         of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

         If the recoverable amount of an asset (cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,
         the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
         recognised as an expense immediately.

         Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, other than for goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset
         (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that
         the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
         impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss
         is recognised as income immediately. Impairment losses cannot be reversed for goodwill.

         RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
         Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.

         The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given,
         liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by EBOS in exchange for control of the acquiree.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
                                                                                                                                         & Disclosures
                                                                                                                                         Directors’ Interests
         Where applicable, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
         arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted
         against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent
         changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in
         accordance with relevant NZ IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are
         not recognised.

Goodwill arising on acquisition

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of business operations because the costs of acquisition included control premiums paid.
In addition, goodwill resulted from the consideration paid for the benefit of future expected cash flows above the current fair
value of the assets acquired and due to the expected synergies and future market benefits expected to be obtained.
These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the expected future economic benefits arising cannot be
reliably measured and they do not meet the definition of identifiable intangible assets.
                                                                                                                                                   Directory




The businesses were acquired because they are profitable healthcare businesses which the Group believes fit strategically
with its existing Australasian healthcare business assets.

     B2. ACQUISITION INFORMATION continued

     Impact of the acquisitions on the results of the Group

     The acquired businesses contributed profit of $1.5m to the Group profit for the year. Group revenue for the year includes
     $6.0m in respect of the businesses acquired. Had the acquisitions been effective at 1 July 2017, the revenue of the Group from
     continuing operations would have been $7.630b and the profit for the period from continuing operations would have been
     $152.960m.

              KEY JUDGEMENT: FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT

              2017:
              The Group acquired a 100% equity interest in Alchemy Holdings Pty Ltd in June 2017 for $162.8m. Due to the timing of
              the acquisition, the acquisition accounting fair value adjustments were identified as being on a provisional basis in
              the Group’s 30 June 2017 financial statements.

              During the current period, the acquisition accounting adjustments have been updated to reflect independent
              valuations performed on the net assets recognised as part of the acquisition. As a result, the following
              adjustments have been recognised in the current period: the recognition of a brand indefinite life intangible asset
              ($9.5m), a decrease in finite life intangible assets ($4.8m to $8.8m) and an increase in deferred tax liabilities
              ($1.5m to $5.8m). Consequently the goodwill recognised on the acquisition has decreased by $3.2m to $127.0m.

     Prior year balances also include the acquisition of Terry White Group.

     Impact on the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement of all acquisitions and fair value adjustments during the year:

           Trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently carried at
           amortised cost. Allowances are made for estimated unrecoverable amounts (provision for doubtful debts), and
           these are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The provision for doubtful debts is measured as the
           difference between the trade receivables carrying amount and expected present value of future cash flows, which
           has considered customer credit history and historical recovery performance and trends.

              RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

              Inventories consist of raw materials (for the manufacturing operations of EBOS) and finished goods. Inventories are
              recognised at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and net realisable value. Cost comprises
              direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing
              the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in
              the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
              and distribution.

              RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

              Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the original purchase consideration and
              those costs directly attributable to bringing the item of property, plant and equipment to the location and condition
              for its intended use. After recognition as an asset, property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated
              depreciation and impairment losses.

              Depreciation of property, plant and equipment assets, other than freehold land, is calculated on a straight-line basis.
              This allocates the cost or fair value amount of an asset, less any residual value, over its estimated useful life.

              JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES – USEFUL LIVES

              EBOS estimates the remaining useful life of assets as follows:

              • Buildings: 20 to 50 years
              • Leasehold improvements: 2 to 15 years
              • Plant and equipment: 2 to 20 years
              • Office equipment, furniture and fittings: 2 to 10 years

              The residual value and useful lives are reviewed and if appropriate adjusted at each reporting date.

     (i) E
          BOS, through a subsidiary company, has a trade debtor securitisation facility of $435.7m (2017: $447.0m) of which $275.4m
         was unutilised at 30 June 2018 (2017: $292.0m). The securitisation facility involves providing security over the future cash
         flows of specific trade receivables, which meet certain criteria, in return for cash finance on a contracted percentage of the
         security provided. As recourse, in the event of default by a trade debtor, remains with EBOS, the trade receivables provided
         as security and the funding provided are recognised on the EBOS Consolidated Balance Sheet.

       At 30 June 2018, the value of trade receivables provided as security under this securitisation facility was $207.4m
       (2017: $198.9m). The net cash flows associated with the securitisation programme are disclosed in the Consolidated
       Cash Flow Statement as cash flows from financing activities.

(ii) EBOS has bank term loans and working capital facilities of $606.5m (2017: $450.4m), of which $132.5m was unutilised at
      30 June 2018 (2017: $8.7m).

  EBOS is in full compliance with its debt facility financial covenants. Bank loans are secured over the assets of EBOS.


            RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

            All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received plus
            issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, these loans and borrowings are subsequently
            measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method which allocates the cost through the expected life
            of the loan or borrowing. The fair value of non-current borrowings is approximately equal to their carrying amount.




                                                                                                                                                Financials
            Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless EBOS has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
            liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

     F2. INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES continued

              RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

              An associate is an entity over which EBOS has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in
              a joint venture or joint operation. EBOS has significant influence when it has the power to participate in the financial
              and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not in control or joint control over those policies.

              Investments in associates are incorporated in the EBOS Group financial statements using the equity method of
              accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
              at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in EBOS’ share of the net assets of the associate, less any
              impairment in the value of individual investments and less any dividends. Losses of an associate in excess of EBOS’
              interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that EBOS has incurred legal or constructive obligations
              or made payments on behalf of the associate.

              Any excess of the cost of acquisition over EBOS’ share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
              contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is
              included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.


     Section G: How we manage risk
                SECTION OVERVIEW

                This section describes the financial risks that EBOS has identified and how it manages these risks, to protect
                its financial position and financial performance. Management of these risks includes the use of financial
                instruments to hedge against unfavourable interest rate and foreign currency movements.


     G1. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

     The EBOS corporate treasury function provides services to the Group’s entities, co-ordinates access to financial markets,
     and manages the financial risks relating to the operation of the Group.

     EBOS does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
     The use of financial derivatives is governed by Group policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written
     principles on the use of financial derivatives. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board of
     Directors on a regular basis.

              FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

              EBOS is exposed to foreign currency risk arising primarily from the procurement of goods denominated in foreign
              currencies (US dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht, Euro and British pound).

     Foreign exchange rate exposures are managed utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

     EBOS enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated future purchase
     transactions denominated in foreign currencies in accordance with the Board approved treasury policy.

              INTEREST RATE RISK

              EBOS is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds in both New Zealand dollars and Australian dollars at
              floating interest rates.

                                                                                                                                        Business
The risk is assessed and managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts.

Under interest rate swap contracts, EBOS agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable EBOS to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates
on debt held.

Interest rate swap contracts are only entered into in accordance with the Group’s Board approved treasury policy.

          LIQUIDITY RISK

          EBOS is exposed to liquidity risk as it must invest in significant levels of working capital such as inventory and
          accounts receivable which can impact liquidity unless they are converted to cash.




                                                                                                                                                  Financials
EBOS manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve banking facilities by
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Refer to note E4 for information on EBOS’ borrowings facility maturity profile.

          CREDIT RISK

          EBOS is exposed to the risk of default in relation to receivables owing from its Healthcare and Animal Care
          customers, hedging instruments and guarantees and deposits held with banks and other financial institutions.

EBOS has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counter parties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss
from defaults.




                                                                                                                                        Governance

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the trade receivables.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represents the
maximum exposure to EBOS of any credit risk.

EBOS does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counter party. The credit risk on liquid funds and
derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by
international credit rating agencies.

EBOS has not changed its overall strategy regarding the management of risk from 2017.

     EBOS has categorised these derivatives, both financial assets and financial liabilities, as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy
     contained within NZ IFRS 13. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the current or prior periods.

     The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs are
     based upon observable forward exchange rates, at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to
     present values.

     Interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow valuation. Key inputs for the valuation of interest rate swaps are
     the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, discounted at a rate that
     reflects the credit risk of the various counterparties.

                                                                                                                                  Business
        RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

        Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
        subsequently remeasured to their fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately
        unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the
        recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. EBOS designates these derivatives as
        cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.

        The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements approximates
        their fair values.

        The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:




                                                                                                                                            Financials
        • the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active
           liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices;

        • the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally
           accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis; and

        • the fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available use
           is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments.

        CASH FLOW HEDGES




                                                                                                                                  Governance
                                                                                                                                  Corporate
        Changes in fair value of hedges that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and are considered effective
        for accounting purposes are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve (in equity) and in other comprehensive
        income. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the income statement.
        Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled in the income statement in the periods when
        the forecast transactions (hedged item) take place.

        However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a
        non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in
        the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.

        Hedge accounting is discontinued when EBOS either revokes the hedging relationship or the hedging instrument
        expires or is terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts deferred in equity are
                                                                                                                                  & Disclosures
                                                                                                                                  Directors’ Interests
        recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.

        When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is
        recognised immediately in profit or loss.

     H6. CHANGES IN FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

     No new accounting standards or interpretations have been adopted during the year which have had a material impact on
     these financial statements. The following new standards have been approved but are not yet effective which may have a
     future impact on the Group financial statements:

     NZ IFRS 16 Leases

     NZ IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including NZ IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it
     becomes effective for EBOS in the 2020 financial year.

     NZ IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
     Distinctions of operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting,
     and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by
     lessees (i.e., all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.

     The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less
     accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is
     initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is
     adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications.

     Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under NZ IAS 17 are presented
     as operating cash flows; whereas under the NZ IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest
     portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively. As a result reported EBITDA will be higher
     upon the adoption of IFRS 16.

     The new requirement to recognise a right-of use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have a significant impact
     on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the directors are currently assessing its
     potential impact. The Group has begun to assess the impact of the new standard and prepare for its implementation from
     1 July 2019, however it is not considered practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect at this time until
     the directors complete their review.

     NZ IFRS 9 Financial instruments

     NZ IFRS 9 establishes the principles for hedge accounting, measurement, classifications and impairment of financial assets.
     Under NZ IFRS 9, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting. In addition,
     the effectiveness test has been overhauled and replaced with the principle of an ‘economic relationship’. Retrospective
     testing assessment of hedge effectiveness is also no longer required. Enhanced disclosure requirements about an entity’s
     risk management activities have also been introduced. In relation to the impairment of financial assets NZ IFRS 9 requires an
     expected credit loss model to be applied, as opposed to an incurred credit loss model under NZ IAS 39. The expected credit
     loss model requires an entity to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each
     reporting date to reflect changes in counter party risk. This standard will be effective for EBOS in the 2019 financial year.
     The Group has reviewed NZ IFRS 9 and has concluded that applying the standard is not expected to have a material impact
     on the Group’s financial statements.

     NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts

     NZ IFRS 15 provides a single, comprehensive principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
     This standard will be effective for EBOS in the 2019 financial year. The five steps in the model are: identify the contract with
     the customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction
     price to the performance obligations in the contract; and, recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
     obligation. The Group has reviewed NZ IFRS 15 and has concluded that applying the standard will have an immaterial impact
     on profit and will not materially impact revenue recognised in the Group’s financial statements.

     Unmarketable Parcels as at 16 July 2018

     As at 16 July 2018, there were 111 shareholders (with a total of 1,366 shares) holding less than a marketable parcel of shares,
     based on the closing price of the Company’s shares on the ASX of A$18.90. The ASX Listing Rules define a marketable parcel
     of shares as a parcel of shares of not less than A$500.

     Waivers from the NZX and ASX Listing Rules

     Waivers granted from the application of NZX and ASX Listing Rules are published on the Company’s website.

     The terms of the Company’s admission to the ASX and on-going listing requires the following disclosures:

     1. The Company is not subject to Chapters 6, 6A, 6B and 6C of the Australian Corporations Act dealing with the acquisition of
         shares (including substantial holdings and takeovers).

     2. Limitations on the acquisition of securities imposed under New Zealand law are as follows:

        (a) In general, securities in the Company are freely transferable and the only significant restrictions or limitations in relation
            to the acquisition of securities are those imposed by New Zealand laws relating to takeovers, overseas investment and
            competition.

        (b) T
             he New Zealand Takeovers Code creates a general rule under which the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting rights
            in the Company or the increase of an existing holding of 20% or more of the voting rights of the Company can only occur
            in certain permitted ways. These include a full takeover offer in accordance with the Takeovers Code, a partial takeover
            in accordance with the Takeovers Code, an acquisition approved by an ordinary resolution, an allotment approved by
            an ordinary resolution, a creeping acquisition (in certain circumstances), or compulsory acquisition of a shareholder
            holding 90% or more of the shares.

        (c) The New Zealand Overseas Investment Act 2005 and Overseas Investment Regulations 2005 (New Zealand) regulate
             certain investments in New Zealand by overseas interests. In general terms, the consent of the New Zealand Overseas
             Investment Office is likely to be required where an ‘overseas person’ acquires shares in the Company that amount to
             25% or more of the shares issued by the Company, or if the overseas person already holds 25% or more, the acquisition
             increases that holding.

        (d) The New Zealand Commerce Act 1986 is likely to prevent a person from acquiring shares in the Company if the
             acquisition would have, or would be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market.

     Voting Rights

     Shareholders may vote at a meeting of shareholders either in person or by proxy, attorney, or representative. Where voting is
     by show of hands or by voice every shareholder present in person or representative has one vote.

     In a poll every shareholder present in person or by proxy, attorney or representative has one vote for each share.

shares in the company. While the shares are issued and
held in the executive’s name, the shares will not vest
unless and until performance conditions are met. The
executive cannot deal in the shares unless and until those
shares vest. All dividends received in respect of the shares
must be applied to the repayment of the loan.
