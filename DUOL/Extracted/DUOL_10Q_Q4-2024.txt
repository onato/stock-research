Dear shareholders,
We closed out 2024 with a record-breaking quarter. We surpassed 40 million DAUs; added our largest-ever
number of net paid subscribers; achieved our highest-ever quarterly bookings, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA; and
delivered 42% free cash flow margin. Duolingo Max, our highest subscription tier, helped drive this growth by
exceeding our expectations. Our New Year’s Promotion was also strong during the last four days of December.

Total bookings were $271.6 million, an increase of 42% from the prior year quarter;
Subscription bookings were $236.5 million, an increase of 50% from the prior year quarter;
Paid subscribers totaled 9.5 million at quarter end, an increase of 43% from the prior year quarter;
Daily active users (DAUs) were 40.5 million, an increase of 51% from the prior year quarter, and monthly
active users (MAUs) were 116.7 million, an increase of 32% from the prior year quarter;
Total revenues were $209.6 million, an increase of 39% from the prior year quarter;
Net income was $13.9 million, compared to $12.1 million in the prior year quarter;
Adjusted EBITDA was $52.3 million, compared to $35.2 million in the prior year quarter, a 25.0% versus
23.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively; and
Net cash provided by operating activities was $83.3 million, compared to $49.2 million in the prior year
quarter, and free cash flow was $87.8 million, compared to $47.7 million in the prior year quarter.

2024 highlights and 2025 priorities
Our growth starts with users. We create engaging experiences that teach our users and keep them coming back
every day. This engagement translates into bookings as users pay for subscriptions. With scale and disciplined
investment, we have turned our top-line momentum into sustained profitability. This reinforcing cycle—users,
bookings, and profitability—has fueled our ability to reinvest and expand our mission to more people.
User growth
Powered by product improvements and creative marketing, our user growth has been remarkable over the past
since 2021.

DUOLINGO Q4 / FY 2024

In 2024, we introduced many new product features, which boosted engagement and user retention. One measure
of engagement is our DAU/MAU ratio, which rose more than 4 points year over year to 34.7% in Q4. Over 10 million
of our users now maintain streaks of one year or longer, and one-third of our DAUs have a Friend Streak. We
believe that our unhinged and viral marketing campaigns—like our 5-second Super Bowl ad, Duolingo on Ice, and
“Owl Game” partnership with Netflix—contributed to our user growth and the growth of our iconic brand. Because
of this work, AdAge named Duolingo “Marketer of the Year.” We’ve also successfully diversified our marketing
channels. In 2024, our views on YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels grew over 430% and 450% year over year,
respectively.
In 2025, we’ll continue improving our product through A/B testing, increasing experiment velocity to make the
experience more social and gamified. We’ll also expand our reach by launching new courses, such as Chinese for
Korean speakers and German for Japanese speakers. We also plan to provide English learners with a more
engaging experience by improving existing features like Video Call.

DUOLINGO Q4 / FY 2024

Monetization
Bookings grew 40% year-over-year in 2024. This was fueled by our packaging, promotion, and conversion
experiments as well as the evolution of our subscription offerings, like Duolingo Max.

We also made significant progress launching Duolingo Max in more countries and courses, and it’s now available
to a majority of our users. By year-end, this premium tier accounted for 5% of paid subscribers. Video Call, our
real-time conversation feature introduced in Q3 2024, has been a key driver of this success by addressing a
critical learning gap: practicing speaking skills. And because we see English learners engaging with this feature
significantly more than learners of other languages, we believe this could help us monetize this audience over
time.
In 2025, our priority is to elevate Video Call by making Lily, our AI-powered conversation partner, more dynamic
and interactive in order to strengthen user engagement and further differentiate Duolingo Max as a premium
offering.

We gained operating leverage across Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing (S&M), and General
and administrative (G&A) expenses thanks to efficiency gains as we’ve scaled that helped us grow revenues faster
than operating expenses. AI and automation tools in particular have helped us significantly scale our lesson
content creation, helping to drive efficiency gains in R&D. Here’s a chart of our content growth as measured by
course units published per year since 2021:

In 2025, we will continue investing in our core product, especially Duolingo Max and Video Call, and promote it
globally. At the same time, we’ll lay the foundation for longer-term initiatives like Math and Music. Our fast-paced
product development allows us to leverage advancements in generative AI to boost user engagement and
monetization through features like Video Call, and we’ve already seen significant early success doing so.
Since our IPO, we’ve rapidly expanded profitability (shown in charts above). While we expect to continue growing
margins this year, we will do so at a more measured pace due to the investments we are making into AI and the
variable costs associated with Video Call. We see a tremendous growth opportunity ahead and believe that by
investing strategically now, we can drive sustained, long-term success.

Closing remarks
2024 was an extraordinary year for Duolingo. People often ask me, “What’s the secret behind Duolingo’s success?”
The truth is, there’s no secret—just our mission and a process. We call the process "The Green Machine." It’s our
approach to experimentation, and it’s the engine behind everything we do, from product development to viral
marketing. To see how we operate in more detail, I welcome you all to read the Duolingo Handbook, which we just
published a few weeks ago.
I’m incredibly excited for what lies ahead. Each Monday, I share a message with the entire company. In my first
note this January, I told the team that I believe 2025 will be our best year yet. Thank you for being a part of our
journey to make learning accessible, effective, and delightful for everyone.
Until next time, we’ll continue to make it fun.

In Q4, total bookings reached a record high of $271.6 million, growing 42% year over year on a reported basis
(and 45% on a constant currency basis) driven primarily by a 50% increase in subscription bookings. In FY
2024, total bookings were $870.6 million, up 40% year over year on a reported basis (and 42% on a constant
currency basis), driven primarily by a 47% increase in subscription bookings.
In Q4, revenues were $209.6 million, 39% higher year over year both on a reported and constant currency
basis, driven primarily by an increase in subscription revenue, which grew 48% year over year, and comprised
83% of revenues. In FY 2024, revenues were $748.0 million, 41% higher year over year on both a reported and
constant currency basis, driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which was up 50% year over year,
and comprised 81% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of paid subscribers year over year. In Q4, subscription revenue per average subscriber
increased 2% year over year, primarily due to a higher mix of both family plan and Duolingo Max subscribers.

In Q4, gross margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points year over year to 71.9% due to lower
subscription margins from increased generative AI costs due to the increased adoption of Duolingo Max, and
lower advertising gross margin during the period from lower advertising revenue per DAU. This was offset by
an increase in subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue. In FY 2024, gross margin decreased by
approximately 50 basis points year over year to 72.8%. This was mainly due to lower advertising gross margin,
offset by an increase in subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue.

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, as well
as other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q4 and FY 2024 was for stock-based compensation
(SBC) expenses related to equity awards of $36.6 million and $120.3 million, respectively. Roughly 15% of our
SBC expense in Q4 was related to our pre-IPO founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as the sole
equity award opportunity for our founders through 2031.
In Q4 and FY 2024, we achieved significant operating leverage across total operating expenses, both on a GAAP
and non-GAAP basis.
(1) Other revenue is comprised mainly of Advertising, Duolingo English Test, and In-App Purchases.

In Q4, GAAP R&D expense decreased from 33% to 32% of revenue year over year, and in FY 2024, GAAP R&D
expense decreased from 37% to 31% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis†, R&D expense decreased year over
year from 24% to 23% in Q4 and decreased from 27% to 23% in FY 2024. We continued to see leverage from
our R&D investments, with top-line growth outpacing our spending in this area. Our team of engineers,
designers, and product managers run countless experiments to make our products more engaging and
effective at converting free users into subscribers. We believe his disciplined approach allows us to scale
efficiently while delivering meaningful growth.
In Q4, GAAP S&M expense decreased from 13% to 12% of revenue year over year, and in FY 2024, GAAP S&M
expense decreased from 14% to 12%. On a non-GAAP basis†, S&M expense decreased year over year from 12%
to 11% in Q4, and decreased from 13% to 11% in FY 2024. Our social-first marketing strategy continues to
deliver strong results, enabling us to attract new users efficiently. By focusing on creative, high-impact efforts,
we’ve improved user acquisition effectiveness and sustained growth as we’ve scaled.
In Q4, GAAP G&A expense decreased from 24% to 22% of revenue year over year, and in FY 2024 GAAP G&A
decreased from 25% to 21%. On a non-GAAP basis†, G&A expense decreased year over year from 15% to 13%
of revenues in both Q4, and FY 2024. Year over year operating leverage in G&A primarily came from employee,
office, and professional expenses.

$191.9 million, or a 25.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin. The increase was driven by growth in revenue and
improved leverage across all categories of operating expenses during the period, as we continued to manage
the business with cost and capital discipline.
During Q4 and FY 2024, we generated free cash flow (FCF)† of $87.8 million (a 41.9% FCF margin†) and $274.9
million (a 36.8% FCF margin†), respectively, driven primarily by an increase in cash from operations.

Our guidance in the table above assumes foreign exchange rates as of February 21, 2025.
On a constant currency basis, assuming the average foreign exchange rates for full-year 2024 remained
constant for full-year 2025, we estimate that our full-year 2025 year-over-year growth for bookings and
revenue at 26.2% to 28.1% and 30.1% to 32.2%, respectively.
On a constant currency basis, assuming the average foreign exchange rates for Q1 2024 remained constant for
Q1 2025, we estimate that our Q1 2025 year-over-year growth for bookings and revenue at 30.8% to 32.4% and
33.6% to 35.4%, respectively.
With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a
reconciliation to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance
with GAAP, has not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net
income cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP
adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such
as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP
adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude
of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the
probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and
potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the
learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the
average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs
is the three months ended December 31, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the
analysis of results is based on those periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user
community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the
learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the
average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three
months ended December 31, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of
results is based on those periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user
community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription
offering and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is
treated as a single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the
count of paid subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying
members of a family plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and inapp purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results,
including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription
revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates
of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how
our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform
that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks
user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations
may be inaccurate. We believe that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable
period of measurement, and that the methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these
metrics are reasonable bases to identify trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we
employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other
companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.
DUOLINGO Q4 / FY 2024

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin, constant currency measures, non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A
expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP operating expenses”), free cash flow, and free cash flow margin. Please
refer to the definitions and reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures
for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By
excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these
non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance.
Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they
allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and
operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to
help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of
non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not
as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other
companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently
or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues and bookings, which
exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to
investors to facilitate comparisons and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign
currency may vary significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of
our management. We calculate constant currency revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues
and translating them to constant currency using prior year comparable period exchange rates for the entire
period of related bookings. We calculate constant currency bookings by using current period foreign currency
bookings and translating them to constant currency using prior year comparable period exchange rates. The
constant currency percentage change for revenues and bookings is calculated by dividing the difference
between the constant currency amount and the prior year comparable period amount by the prior year
comparable period amount.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, transaction costs related to
acquisitions, acquisition earn-out costs, gain on sale of capitalized software, loss on disposal of leasehold
improvements and impairment of capitalized software. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA
as a percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and
marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the
respective GAAP operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation
expenses related to equity awards, and, as applicable, transaction costs related to acquisitions, acquisition
earn-out costs, gain on sale of capitalized software, loss on disposal of leasehold improvements, and
impairment of capitalized software. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate
the financial performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we
believe that they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by
analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables
present a reconciliation of our net income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable
financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and
non-GAAP operating expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development
costs and purchases of property and equipment and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation
equity awards, transaction costs related to acquisitions and acquisition earn-out payments as we believe such items
are not indicative of future liquidity. Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues.
We believe that Free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management,
investors and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash
that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in
that it does not represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary
commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most
directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
