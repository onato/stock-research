Dear shareholders,
The momentum we had in the first two quarters of the year carried over to the third, and we continued to
outperform our expectations. Here’s a summary of our Q3 2023 results:

Third Quarter Highlights
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

DAUs increased 63% to 24.2 million and MAUs increased 47% to 83.1 million, compared to the prior
year quarter;
The number of paid subscribers totaled 5.8 million at the end of Q3, an increase of 60% compared to
the end of the prior year quarter;
Total bookings grew 49% and revenue grew 43%, compared to the prior year quarter (48% and 42%,
respectively, on a constant currency basis);
Subscription bookings increased 54% to $121.3 million compared to the prior year quarter (51% on a
constant currency basis);
Our net income was $2.8 million versus a net loss of $18.4 million in the prior year quarter;
We delivered a record high Adjusted EBITDA of $22.5 million, compared to $2.1 million in the prior year
quarter, or a 16.3% and 2.2% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively; and
Cash flow from operating activities was $37.7 million compared to $8.8 million in the prior year
quarter, and free cash flow was $33.5 million compared to $6.1 million in the prior year quarter.

Based on our strong performance year to date, we are raising our full-year 2023 guidance: total bookings are
now expected to grow about 40% year over year, and Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to fall within the
range of 16.6—16.9%, representing a nearly 13 point increase over the prior year.

One App to Teach Them All
Last month at Duocon 2023, we announced that we are launching a new Music course, and integrating both
Math and Music into the main Duolingo app. We believe this will allow us to leverage the gamification
mechanics that we’ve already built in order to more rapidly scale these new subjects.
For learners, this creates new, compelling reasons to try or return to Duolingo—you can keep your streak alive
by doing a math lesson one day and a music or language lesson the next. It also gives our 24+ million daily
active users more reasons to recommend Duolingo to their friends and families.
As with everything that we do, we are taking the long view with this multi-subject strategy, which means we
will prioritize building the best product possible for our learners. We believe that adding new subjects will
make our flagship app even more delightful and engaging, and will further enhance user retention, but we do
not expect these new subjects to meaningfully contribute to monetization in the near-term.
We’ve shared before that about 80% of our learners in the U.S. were not learning a language before using
Duolingo. Over time, we hope to see a similar dynamic with math and music in which we expand the market
and grow the number of people learning these subjects.

Duo Re Mi
Our new Music course will be available for learners on iOS this month and will teach basic music literacy, like
how to read notes and play simple songs using an on-screen keyboard. Studies show that learning music can
also help with reading, verbal, listening, and math skills… and learning music the Duolingo way is a lot of fun!

Our new music course uses fun, bite-sized lessons

We Run Hundreds of Experiments to Get Better
We’re on track to have our best year ever in terms of user growth, bookings, revenue, and profitability. As
we’ve mentioned in previous shareholder letters, we have achieved this in large part because of our culture of
experimentation and A/B testing. Through our experiments, we strive to make incremental progress on user
engagement, learning outcomes, and monetization. We are not only innovating with new initiatives, like Math
and Music, but we are also continuing to improve existing gamification features like Leaderboards,
Achievements, and Friends Quests. We continue to see improvement in our engagement metrics and today,
over 70% of DAUs have a streak longer than one week, and nearly 20% have a streak longer than a year!
Our experimentation is not limited to A/B tests in the product. For example, while the vast majority of our new
user growth is organic, there are a couple of times during the year when we step up our paid user acquisition,
namely in the summer and around the New Year. During August and September, when children are going back
to school and adults are getting back into a routine, we take advantage of seasonally lower ad rates and run
tests to see if we can become more efficient. This year our summer campaign did exceptionally well, driving
about 50% more new users than last year with essentially flat costs, showing that we have become
increasingly efficient at acquiring new users through marketing.

AI-Enhanced Learning
Thanks to the approximately 10 billion exercises our users complete every week, we have more data on how
people learn languages than anyone in history. Our trove of data has made AI a consistently important tool for
us, and it’s inspiring to see how much progress we’ve made using generative AI over the past few quarters.
Generative AI is accelerating our work by helping us create new content dramatically faster. Additionally,
Duolingo Max, which we’re still experimenting with, was rolled out to more learners in Q3 and we are seeing
increased usage of Max’s AI features.
We also revealed an exciting new feature at Duocon that is enabled by AI: DuoRadio. This is a new lesson
format that improves how we teach listening. Learners can enjoy short, podcast-like radio shows featuring
Duolingo characters as the hosts. AI is used to generate the episode scripts, which allowed us to launch this
feature in less than two quarters. DuoRadio is already available to Spanish learners on Android, and we’re
currently testing it for Spanish learners on iOS.

DuoRadio is our newest lesson type in the learning path

In Closing
I want to thank everyone who tuned in to Duocon in October, which drew record attendance. We have
already exceeded our expectations and had an incredible 1.6M views in less than 30 days! Thanks to our fans,
we’re not only the world’s most popular education app, but also one of the world’s largest communities of
lifelong learners. And a huge thanks to our entire team for continuously striving for excellence.
Until next time, don’t forget to do your language, math, or music lessons on Duolingo!

Non-Subscription

In the third quarter, total bookings grew 49% year over year on a reported basis (and 48% on a constant
currency basis) to $153.6 million, driven primarily by a 54% increase in subscription bookings (51% on a
constant currency basis). Revenues grew 43% year over year on a reported basis to $137.6 million in the third
quarter (and 42% on a constant currency basis), driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which
grew 47% year over year, and comprised 77% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of subscribers year over year. Subscription revenue per subscriber declined 7% year
over year, primarily due to stronger growth in non-U.S. countries that have lower regional pricing, partially
offset by foreign currency changes.

Gross margin increased by approximately 100 basis points year over year to 73.7% in the third quarter. This
was primarily driven by higher subscription margins as a result of a reduction in third-party payment
processing fees per subscriber, as well as higher margins on the Duolingo English Test primarily driven by
higher pricing. These improvements were partially offset by lower advertising margins during the period due to
lower advertising revenue per DAU.

G&A

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and IPO
and public company costs, as well as other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q3 2023 was for
stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses related to equity awards† of $26 million. Approximately a quarter of
our SBC expense in Q3 was related to our pre-IPO founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as the
sole equity award opportunity for our founders through 2031. As a reminder, these founder awards are
intended to align our founders’ economic interests with those of shareholders because they vest, in part, based
upon the achievement of stock price hurdles that, if achieved, would result in significant value creation for our
equity holders. However, these founder awards are expensed even if none of the stock price hurdles are
achieved. The next hurdle would be achieved if our stock price averaged $178.50 per share for 60 days.
In Q3, we achieved significant leverage across total operating expenses, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
GAAP R&D expense decreased from 44% to 37% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expense
decreased year over year from 34% to 27%. Our top line performance has outpaced our growth in R&D
expense, which is primarily driven by hiring talented engineers, product managers, and designers who work to
continuously improve our products to improve engagement and efficacy which, we believe, drives organic user
growth.
GAAP S&M expense decreased from 18% to 16% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, S&M expense
decreased year over year from 17% to 15%. We are becoming increasingly efficient at spending our marketing
dollars strategically through experimentation and applied learnings.
GAAP G&A expense decreased from 31% to 24% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A expense
decreased year over year from 18% to 15%. Year over year operating leverage in G&A primarily came from
employee, office, and insurance expenses.

In Q3, we achieved our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA†, which increased by $20.4 million year over year to
$22.5 million, a 16.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin. The increase was driven by growth in revenue and improved
leverage across all categories of operating expenses.
During Q3, we generated free cash flow (FCF)† of $33.5 million, a 24.3% FCF margin†, driven primarily by an
increase in cash from operations.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation
to GAAP net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has
not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net (loss) income cannot
be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares
granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax
and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be
accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable
information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its third quarter results today, November 8, 2023, at 5:30 p.m. ET. This
live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at investors.duolingo.com. A
replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion of the webcast and will
remain available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo
Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the
Apple App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide
learners a fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the
best education in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. The
measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the same period in the prior year
where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global
active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement
period for DAUs is the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the same period in the prior year where
applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement
of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates
of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how
our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform
that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks
user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations
may be inaccurate. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics
may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q3 2023

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA
margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP
operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at
the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and
as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our
recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures
are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures
used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional
investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number
of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial
measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues, which exclude the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons
and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from
period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We calculate constant
currency revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues and translating them to constant currency
using prior year comparable period exchange rates. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by
determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current
period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, transaction costs related to an
acquisition, acquisition earn-out costs, and loss on disposal of leasehold improvements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is
defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and
development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. These non-GAAP operating expenses
are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based
compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as applicable, transaction costs related to an acquisition and
acquisition earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial
performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are
helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and
other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables present a reconciliation of our
net (loss) income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in
accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses,
respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development
costs and purchases of property and equipment and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation
equity awards and transaction costs related to an acquisition, as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity.
Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a
measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and
evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities
or investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash
flow for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
