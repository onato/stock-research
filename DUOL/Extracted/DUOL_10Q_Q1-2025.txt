DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2025

Dear shareholders,
2025 is off to a fantastic start, continuing our strong momentum across user growth, monetization, and
profitability. In Q1, we added more Daily Active Users (DAUs) than ever before—a clear sign that we continue to
sustain meaningful growth at scale. Bookings growth exceeded our prior guidance, driven by continued
subscriber growth and the strong performance of our higher-priced plans like Duolingo Max and the family
plan. Profitability for Q1 was above our expectations, and we are seeing early progress in optimizing AI costs.
Given our strong execution, we are raising the midpoint of our full-year bookings guidance to 29% YoY growth
(30% on a constant currency basis) and the midpoint of our full-year Adjusted EBITDA margin to 28% YoY
growth. More detail can be found in the Q2 and FY 2025 Guidance section below.

26.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively; and
Net cash provided by operating activities was $105.6 million, compared to $83.5 million in the prior
year quarter, and free cash flow(1) was $103.0 million, compared to $78.5 million in the prior year
quarter.

Sustained user growth and engagement
This quarter, we launched one of our most successful marketing campaigns ever and spent practically nothing
on it: Dead Duo. This social-led narrative—a ‘whodunit’ mystery—generated 1.7 billion organic impressions,
and drove a meaningful lift in new and resurrected users as our community rallied around their favorite owl.
While brand moments like Dead Duo spark significant user growth, our ongoing A/B testing aims to continue to
make our product itself a durable growth engine. Our testing infrastructure allows us to explore hundreds of
ideas at once, measure their impact rigorously, and let the best ones shape our product. In Q1, we launched
several improvements across the user experience to drive user retention and engagement, including playful
visual updates and end-of-day nudges to remind users to complete their lessons. We also brought more of our
"unhinged" personality into the app, with updated lesson-end animations that celebrate user achievements in
funny and unexpected ways.

Just a few of the ways we celebrate your progress...with a healthy dose of weirdness

As we continue expanding our learning content to reach more users, I’m excited that we will be rolling out our
Chess course in the coming weeks. Like Music and Math, this expands our learning footprint beyond language,
offering another fun way to build practical skills. We chose Chess as our next subject because it trains strategic
thinking, problem-solving, and mental agility—skills that are valuable far beyond the game itself. Learners
start with the basics, like how each piece moves, and progress to more advanced tactics through bite-sized
challenges and full games against Duolingo characters like Oscar, our new chess coach.

Sharpen your skills one challenge at a time, no grandmaster title required

DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2025

Users are open to trying new subjects like Chess because they trust us to offer fun experiences. Then we let
our beautifully designed, engaging product take it from there. It’s why we’re so excited about expanding beyond
language learning in the long-term.

Monetization and subscriber growth
Our subscription business remains strong. Adoption of our highest-priced subscription tier, Duolingo Max, is
growing, and its flagship feature, Video Call, allows learners to chat with Lily in a fun, low-stakes environment
that builds confidence over time. We have a number of feature enhancements that will be launched in the next
few months, including a new Video Call practice tab that will give learners the opportunity to review past
conversations and listen to voice messages from Lily.

Now in 3D: Conversations with Lily that feel a little too real

We’re also enhancing the experience further by making Lily and her environment 3D. We are adding more
interactive backgrounds and lifelike animations to make conversations feel more immersive. These
enhancements are aimed at making Duolingo Max more engaging and differentiated—ultimately driving greater
adoption of our highest-value subscription tier.

Profitability and operational leverage
With AI-powered learning features like Video Call and Role Play, we believe Duolingo Max represents one of our
biggest opportunities, even as it comes with variable costs that we are actively managing. Last quarter, we
shared that we’d begin experimenting with AI-cost-optimization measures in the first half of this year, and
would start launching them in the second half. However, some of these improvements were so straightforward
that we implemented them ahead of schedule in Q1.

DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2025

6

For example, we made model optimizations that significantly reduced costs for Role Play. Though Role Play
represents a small portion of our overall GenAI costs, we expect the process we followed to reduce its costs is
indicative of how we can implement further cost-saving measures in the second half of the year.
At the same time, we continued to expand our learning content at an unprecedented pace. We were able to
introduce nearly 150 new language courses for different geographies in Q1 using AI-generated content. These
efficiencies are what have allowed us to grow both users and bookings while maintaining strong profit
margins.

Closing remarks
2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year. We’re executing well on the three core priorities we laid out for the
year in our Q4 shareholder letter: driving subscription bookings through user growth and conversion gains,
using AI to enhance Video Call and scale content, and growing profitably with operational discipline.
And, as always, we’re having fun along the way. After Dead Duo, we followed up with our latest April Fools
marketing campaign: a Duolingo-themed cruise, complete with a line of exclusive merch you’ll need to pack
for your next vacation.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a checkmate to plan. See you on the board!

In Q1, total bookings were $271.6 million, growing 38% year over year on a reported basis (42% on a constant
currency basis), driven primarily by a 44% increase in subscription bookings on a reported basis (48% on a
constant currency basis). Revenues totaled $230.7 million in Q1, representing a 38% increase on a reported
basis (40% on a constant currency basis), driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which grew 45%
year over year on a reported basis (47% on a constant currency basis), and comprised 83% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of paid subscribers year over year.

Total gross margin was 71.1% and 73.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,
respectively. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to lower subscription gross margin as a result of
increased generative AI costs related to the expansion of our Duolingo Max tier.

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and
other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q1 2025 was for stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses
related to equity awards of $34.5 million. Approximately 12% of our SBC expense in Q1 was related to our
pre-IPO founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as our founders’ sole equity award opportunity
through 2031.
In Q1, we achieved operating leverage across both GAAP and non-GAAP total operating expenses, as revenue
growth continued to outpace expense growth. GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expenses represented 31% and 22% of
revenue, respectively, both essentially flat to the prior year. GAAP and non-GAAP S&M expenses also held
steady at 12% and 11%, respectively, reflecting continued investment discipline. The most meaningful leverage
came from G&A, which declined from 21% to 19% of revenue on a GAAP basis, and from 14% to 13% on a nonGAAP basis.

Our guidance in the table above assumes foreign exchange rates as of March 31, 2025. On a constant currency basis, assuming the
average foreign exchange rates for Q2 2024 remained constant for Q2 2025, we estimate our Q2 2025 year-over-year growth for
bookings and revenue at 29.0% to 30.6% and 34.7% to 36.4%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, assuming the average
foreign exchange rates for full-year 2024 remained constant for full-year 2025, we estimate our full-year 2025 year-over-year
growth for bookings and revenue at 29.8% to 30.9% and 33.2% to 34.4%, respectively.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a
reconciliation to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance
with GAAP, has not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net
income cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP
adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such
as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP
adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude
of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the
probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and
potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.
Guidance Commentary
Based on our Q1 results and what we’re seeing so far in the second quarter, we’re raising our full-year
bookings guidance (numbers have been rounded from the table above).
• We expect Q2 bookings to grow 29% year-over-year, or 30% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint. Our Q2 bookings guidance assumes DAUs will grow in the range of 40% to 45%.
• We now expect our FY 2025 bookings to grow 29% year-over-year, or 30% on a constant currency basis
at the midpoint.
• Our outlook uses exchange rates as of the end of Q1, so if the recent weakness in the USD persists, it
would result in an upside to our bookings and revenue guidance since over half of our bookings and
revenue come from outside the U.S.

DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2025

13

For gross margin, we continue to expect a year-over-year decline of approximately 150 basis points in FY 2025,
which is a slight improvement from the guidance we provided last quarter. This is driven by stronger-thanexpected Q1 results, where the gross margin decline was closer to 200 basis points year-over-year versus the
300 basis points we had anticipated. For Q2, we continue to expect gross margin to be about 50 basis points
lower compared to Q1, and we feel confident that gross margins will improve in the second half of the year.
Based on our strong top line growth year to date and continued cost discipline, we’re raising our full-year
Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to 28% at the midpoint, representing a 230 basis point expansion over last
year and a full-year incremental margin of 35% at the midpoint. For Q2, we are guiding to an Adjusted EBITDA
margin of 25% at the midpoint, which is consistent with our commentary from last quarter.
As to the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year bookings growth rate to step down by about 300
basis points in Q3, and then by less than that in Q4. Our revenue growth rate is expected to follow a similar
directional trend. For profitability, we expect sequential Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of about 200 basis
points in Q3, and even more meaningful expansion in Q4 as we expect to realize AI cost efficiencies and our
marketing spend to moderate as a percentage of revenue.
Finally, we continue to expect fully diluted share count to increase by about 1% in 2025.

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
March 31, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
March 31, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, the majority of which are twelve months in duration.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our
user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is
used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and
operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session
activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. We believe
that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, and that the
methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these metrics are reasonable bases to identify
trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics
may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2025

16

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, constant currency measures, non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and nonGAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP operating expenses”), free cash flow, and free cash flow margin.
Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures
for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By
excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these nonGAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we
believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional
information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making
and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of
our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and
these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from,
our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as
comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues and bookings, which exclude the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a
means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate
comparisons and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary
significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We
calculate constant currency revenues by translating current period foreign currency revenues using prior-year
exchange rates applied consistently over the full revenue recognition period. We calculate constant currency
bookings by using current period foreign currency bookings and translating them to constant currency using prior
year comparable period exchange rates. The constant currency percentage change for revenues and bookings is
calculated by dividing the difference between the constant currency amount and the prior year comparable period
amount by the prior year comparable period amount.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and acquisition earn-out costs.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses
consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. NonGAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses excluding depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as applicable, acquisition
earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial
performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they
are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts,
investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables present a
reconciliation of our net income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial
measures presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP
operating expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capitalized software development costs
and purchases of property and equipment. Beginning in Q1 2025, we have aligned our calculation of free cash flow to
this definition, and prior periods in this letter have been recast to conform to this presentation. Free cash flow
margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that Free cash flow is a measure of
liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating
the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or
investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow
for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation
of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
