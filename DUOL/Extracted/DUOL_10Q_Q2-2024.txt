User growth
We believe that coupling an app that is fun and effective with our unique marketing approach is driving growth in
both mature and underpenetrated markets. As we’ve discussed in past shareholder letters, our award-winning
marketing efforts are primarily social-first, with culturally relevant and humorous content to foster affinity with
our brand. So far this year, our organic social media impressions are 190% higher than in the same period last
year. Our April Fool’s campaign, Duolingo on Ice, garnered nearly 100 million impressions, over four times that of
our Love Language campaign in 2023.

International growth playbook: Spotlight on Japan
By leveraging our proven social-first marketing approach from established markets, we've developed an effective
international playbook that we can apply to high-opportunity geographies.
Japan exemplifies our playbook in action. We started by investing a modest amount in marketing to ignite growth.
Afterwards, we hired a country marketing manager to spearhead the creation of culturally relevant content
focused on entertainment, leveraging influencers and brand partnerships.
The results to date have been impressive. In Q2, Japan had 93% DAU and 58% bookings growth compared to the
prior year quarter.
We believe there are many untapped markets where we can apply this playbook. To that end, we’ve recently added
country marketing managers in France and Korea, which we believe also have attractive potential.

Introducing the Friend Streak
We continue to invest in social interactions among our learners, which have been a driver of user engagement and
retention. Features like Friends Quests and Leaderboards not only encourage learners to come back more often,
but also transform learning into a shared journey. Over half of our DAUs now follow at least one friend.
We've also talked about the streak being a powerful mechanic that helps users stick to their daily habit. Today, one
out of every five of our DAUs has a streak longer than 365 days.
I'm excited to share that we've brought both of these ideas together in our newest feature called the Friend
Streak. Now, you can invite up to five of your friends to each share a streak with you. If your friend hasn't done
their lesson, you can send a nudge reminding them to extend their streak. Early results have been excellent, since
users are not only accountable to themselves, but also to their friends.

Monetization: Enhanced experience
We continue to enhance our subscription offerings in order to increase revenue. Duolingo Max gives users a more
immersive experience, while the family plan offers a fun way to learn together at a compelling value.
•

Duolingo Max: This premium tier, which includes GenAI-enabled features, is now available in 5 courses
and 27 countries, which together comprise about 15% of our DAUs. We’re also experimenting with an
innovative, new premium feature that allows learners to practice real-time, spoken conversation with
Duolingo characters. You can expect us to continue iterating on Max and expanding its availability to
additional geographies, with most users having access to it by year end. We plan to share more details
about Max at Duocon in September.

•

Family Plan: Currently, our family plan accounts for approximately 20% of subscribers and has higher
retention than individual plans. We’re focused on increasing adoption by increasing the visibility of the
family plan among free learners, driving upgrades from current individual subscribers, and increasing
engagement among existing family members.

Closing
In July, we announced the acquisition of Hobbes, a Detroit-based motion design and animation studio. This
investment underscores our commitment to design and animation, which are key drivers of user engagement and
monetization, and cornerstones of the Duolingo brand.
I invite you to tune into Duocon on September 24 to hear more about our biggest product announcements of the
year.
Until next time, start a Friend Streak and don’t let your friends down!

In Q2, total bookings were $190.1 million, growing 38% year over year on a reported basis (and 41% on a
constant currency basis), driven primarily by a 47% increase in subscription bookings on a reported basis (and
50% on a constant currency basis). Revenues totaled $178.3 million in Q2, representing a 41% increase on a
reported basis (and 42% on a constant currency basis), driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue,
which grew 51% year over year on a reported basis (and 52% on a constant currency basis), and comprised
81% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of paid subscribers year over year.

Total gross margin was 73.4% during both the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Q2 2024 was the
same as the year ago period due to a higher subscription gross margin contribution from an increase in
subscriber revenue as a percentage of total revenue, partially offset by a decline in Advertising margins, which
was due to a decrease in average revenue per DAU.

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and
other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q2 2024 was for stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses
related to equity awards of $28 million. Approximately one fifth of our SBC expense in Q2 was related to our
pre-IPO founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as our founders’ sole equity award opportunity
through 2031.
In Q2, we achieved leverage across total operating expenses and for each category of operating expense, both
on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, because we continued to scale our revenue faster than our operating
expenses. GAAP R&D expense decreased from 38% to 31% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis,
R&D expense decreased year over year from 29% to 23%. GAAP S&M expense decreased from 14% to 11% of
revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, S&M expense decreased year over year from 13% to 11%. GAAP
G&A expense decreased from 25% to 21% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A expense
decreased year over year from 15% to 14%.

In Q2, we achieved our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA†, which increased by $27.2 million year over year to
$48.1 million, a 27.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin†. The increase in margin was driven by growth in revenue and
improved leverage across all categories of operating expenses.
During Q2, we generated free cash flow (FCF)† of $54.9 million, a 30.8% FCF margin†, driven primarily by an
increase in cash from operations. Cash from operations increased mainly due to generation of higher net
income during the current period.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation
to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not
been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income cannot be
calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stockbased compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted
and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and
regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately
forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable
information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its second quarter and full year results today, August 7, 2024, at 5:30
p.m. ET. This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at
investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion
of the webcast and will remain available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo
Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the
Apple App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide
learners a fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the
best education in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
June 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
June 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates
of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how
our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform
that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks
user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations
may be inaccurate. We believe that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable
period of measurement, and that the methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these
metrics are reasonable bases to identify trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we
employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other
companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q2 / FY 2024

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA;
Adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively,
the “non-GAAP operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and
reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational
decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not
be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial
measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial
measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our
institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there
are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these nonGAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues, which exclude the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons
and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from
period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We calculate constant
currency revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues and translating them to constant currency
using prior year comparable period exchange rates for the entire period of related bookings. Constant currency
revenue percentage change is calculated by dividing the difference between constant currency revenue and the prior
year comparable period revenue by the prior year comparable period revenue.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, transaction costs related to acquisitions, and
acquisition earn-out costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.
GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and
administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses
excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as
applicable, transaction costs related to an acquisition and acquisition earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial
measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present these

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development
costs and purchases of property and equipment and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation
equity awards and transaction costs related to acquisitions as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity.
Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a
measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and
evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities
or investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash
flow for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
