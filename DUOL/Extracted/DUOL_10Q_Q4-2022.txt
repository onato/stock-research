Dear shareholders,
We had a “Super” strong finish to 2022, outperforming our expectations and setting new records for active
users and bookings in Q4. This letter is focused on what we’re looking forward to in 2023, from innovative AIdriven features that drive engagement, to brand-new course content for more advanced English learners. But
first, here’s a summary of how we performed in Q4:

Q4 Highlights
 For the sixth quarter in a row, we saw accelerating user growth on Duolingo: DAUs increased 62% to 16.3
million and MAUs increased 43% to 60.7 million, compared to the prior year quarter
 We added a record number of paid Super Duolingo subscribers, which totaled 4.2 million at the end of Q4,
an increase of 67% compared to the prior year quarter, and family plan subscribers now make up over 12%
of total subscribers
 Total bookings grew 39% and revenue grew 42%, compared to the prior year quarter (46% and 47%,
respectively, on a constant currency basis)
 Subscription bookings grew 44% compared to the prior year quarter and in-app purchases (IAPs) grew
more than 100%.


Before we look ahead to 2023, I want to review what drives our user and bookings growth.

Our Advantage Is Our Great Free Product
Our freemium business model enables us to grow organically and keeps competitors at bay. 


We didn’t monetize Duolingo for years after launching it, so we didn’t want to spend to acquire our users. We
found that the most cost efficient growth came from making our product so fun and engaging that people
would tell their friends and family about it. That strategy worked well, and it's why 90% of our user growth has
been organic and why we feel so strongly that our free product must remain excellent.


The size of our user base is a big part of our data moat. Duolingo has more data on how people learn
languages than any other entity in history, and we use that data to improve our effectiveness and engagement.
This creates a strong flywheel effect: our product gets better as we get more learner data, and that in turn
drives word of mouth growth and increases the amount of data we have.


Having an excellent free product also reduces friction for returning users, who can easily come back after a
period of being away. On any given day, the number of returning users (i.e., those who have been away for
more than a month) is roughly the same as the number of brand new users who come to the platform.
Language learning is often a lifelong process, and while learners may take a break, they eventually come back
to resume their lessons. And our personalized experience allows them to easily jump back in.

Looking Ahead to 2023
In 2023, in addition to the thousands of A/B tests we normally run to improve our products, we’re focused on
two emerging opportunities: generative artificial intelligence (AI) and English language learners.

Since our founding, we have leveraged new technology to help us execute on our mission of making the best
education in the world universally available. In 2012, we made the decision to create a mobile-first experience.
The smartphone was a seminal change, and betting on it allowed Duolingo to become the company it is today.
We now believe that AI is likely to be the next technological sea change.

While we have been investing in AI since 2013 to power both the Duolingo language learning app and the
Duolingo English Test, the technology has advanced to a level that is within striking distance of our vision to
teach as well as a human tutor. As such, we’ve begun testing a higher subscription tier (above Super Duolingo)
with new generative AI features, called Duolingo Max, that is the next step on this path. We worked closely with
OpenAI to develop Max features, using an advanced system that is optimized for language learning.
Duolingo Max will offer two powerful features on top of Super Duolingo: Explain My Answer and Roleplay. 

Explain My Answer will provide in-depth explanations, generated by AI, to help learners understand their
mistakes in a Duolingo lesson. Roleplay will give learners a chance to chat with Duolingo characters in order
to help build critical conversation skills. Using AI, we will guide learners through ordering coffee or asking for
directions, and give feedback on their progress. 

We believe that together, these new features will allow us to get closer to simulating a human tutor while
continuing to make Duolingo even more engaging and fun.
We’ve begun testing Duolingo Max in select markets, and expect to roll it out to more learners throughout 2023.

New Course Content for More Advanced English Learners
The vast majority (nearly 90%) of language learners in the world are learning English, but only about 45% of
Duolingo users are doing so. We see a clear opportunity to expand our presence in the English-learning
market and drive international monetization by broadening our English learning course offerings.

Currently all Duolingo courses are structured to teach a target language from a base language. For example,
our course to teach English for Spanish speakers is different from and more comprehensive than our course
to teach English for Arabic speakers. As such, more advanced English learners from Arabic can’t benefit as
much from Duolingo. To serve learners who already know basic English, we’re using generative AI and our
unique teaching methods to create intermediate content that we can scale to all of our English courses.

We’re excited to better address this market and believe it will unlock incremental user and bookings growth
over time.

2023 Financial Profile
In 2022, we grew DAUs by 62%, subscribers by 67%, and bookings by 46%, while our non-GAAP sales &
marketing (S&M) expenses only grew by 20%. We saw operating leverage in S&M because our user and
bookings growth came, in large part, from our R&D investments in years past. We expense nearly all our R&D
spend as it is incurred, but in many ways the improvements that come from our engineers, designers, and
product managers become assets that compound over time, paying off for years. That’s why we also expect to
get leverage in R&D over time.

With over 2 billion people learning languages around the world, we have a huge market opportunity ahead of
us. We believe we will continue to grow the top line rapidly as we progress toward our long-term Adjusted
EBITDA margin target of 30-35%. This year, we expect to achieve an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10-12%, up
from about 4% in 2022. This implies more than 30% of incremental flow through to Adjusted EBITDA in 2023,
with the second half of the year showing even higher incremental profitability.

In Closing
I decided to keep this letter short to focus on the new opportunities we’re looking forward to in 2023. In
addition to these, we will continue to work on expanding beyond language learning through our literacy and
math apps, on the Duolingo English Test, on making Duolingo more social, and on a la carte IAPs, all of which I
will update you on in the coming quarters.

Until next time, don’t forget to do your daily lessons!

Summary of Financial and Key Operating Metrics

(1) Please refer to the Appendix at the end of this letter for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

Amounts reported in millions are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components reported in
millions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. In addition, percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying numbers in thousands and may not add to their respective totals due to rounding.

In the fourth quarter, total bookings reached a record high of $126.4 million, growing 39% year over year on a reported
basis (about 46% on a constant currency basis). In 2022, total bookings grew 46% year over year on a reported basis to
$428.6 million (about 52% on a constant currency basis). This was mainly driven by a 48% increase in subscription
bookings, which was due to a growing number of first-time and renewal subscriptions. We also continue to see a shift
to individual annual and family plan subscriptions, which make up about 79% and over 12% of total subscribers at year
end, respectively.


In the fourth quarter, revenues grew 42% year over year on a reported basis to $103.8 million (about 47% on a constant
currency basis). In 2022, revenues grew 47% year over year on a reported basis to $369.5 million (about 51% on a
constant currency basis), driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which grew 51% in 2022. The increase in
subscription revenue was primarily driven by a higher average number of paid subscribers. The table below provides
revenues by product type:

Gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points year over year to 73.3% in Q4, and approximately 70 basis
points year over year to 73.1% in 2022. The improvement for both periods was primarily driven by higher subscription
margins due to stronger retention and lower fees charged by the Google Play store, and were offset by lower margins
in advertising.

*Other primarily includes in-app sales of virtual goods.

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing (S&M), and
General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses adjusted for depreciation,
amortization, stock-based compensation, and IPO and public company costs, as well as other expenses. The majority of
the adjustments in Q4 and 2022 were for stock-based compensation expense of $20.6 million and $73.8 million,
respectively. In Q4 and 2022, $7.3 million and $31.0 million, respectively, were related to our pre-IPO founder equity
awards which are intended to serve as the sole equity award opportunity for our founders through 2031. As a reminder,
these founder awards are meant to align our founders’ economic interests with those of shareholders because they
vest, in part, based upon the achievement of stock price hurdles that, if achieved, would result in significant value
creation for our equity holders. However, they are expensed even if none of the stock price hurdles are achieved. The
next hurdle would be achieved if our stock price averaged $178.50 / share for 60 days.

In Q4, GAAP R&D expense increased slightly from 41% to 43% of revenue year over year, primarily due to growth in
headcount. In 2022, GAAP R&D expense remained flat year over year at 41% of revenue. 

On a non-GAAP basis, we achieved operating leverage in R&D for both Q4 and 2022. In Q4, non-GAAP R&D expense
decreased year over year from 35% to 34% and in 2022, non-GAAP R&D expense decreased year over year from 36% to
33% of revenue.  

We also continue to achieve leverage in S&M expense on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis by applying our past
learnings in order to spend marketing dollars strategically and acquire users more efficiently in under-penetrated
markets. In 2022, GAAP S&M expense decreased year over year from 24% to 18% of revenue, and non-GAAP S&M
expense decreased year over year from 21% to 17% of revenue. 

In Q4, GAAP G&A expense decreased year over year from 35% to 30% of revenue, and in 2022, this expense increased
slightly year over year from 31% to 32% of revenue.  

On a non-GAAP basis in Q4, G&A expense remained flat year over year at 18% of revenue. In 2022, non-GAAP G&A
increased year over year from 16% to 19% of revenue, driven primarily by increased travel and meals (as COVID
restrictions eased), facilities costs (as we built out our new office in Pittsburgh and expanded our NYC office),
professional fees (as we had a full year of costs related to being public and only about half a year of those costs in
2021) and web services and technology costs.

comparable GAAP financial measure.

As we have since our founding, we continue to manage the business with cost and capital discipline. In Q4, Adjusted
EBITDA† increased by $4.9 million year over year to $5.2 million, and in 2022, increased $16.5 million year over year to
$15.5 million. The increase was driven by growth in revenue and gross margin, and improved leverage in operating
expenses.

During Q4 and FY 2022, we generated $11.3 million and $46.2 million in free cash flow†, respectively, driven by an
increase in cash from operations. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities,
reduced by capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment, and increased by IPO
and public company costs, taxes paid related to stock-based compensation equity awards and other costs, as we
believe they are not indicative of future liquidity.

comparable GAAP financial measure.

Q1 and FY 2023 Guidance

Duolingo is providing the following guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2023.

With regards to the Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation
to GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been
provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net loss cannot be calculated or
predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based
compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and
market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory
reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted.
For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could
have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Video Webcast

Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its quarterly and full year results today, February 28, 2023, at 5:30 p.m.
ET. This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at investors.duolingo.com.
A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion of the webcast and will
remain available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo

Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the Apple
App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide learners a
fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the best
education in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase
of a subscription to Super Duolingo. Total bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase of a
subscription to Super Duolingo, a purchase of a Duolingo English Test, an in-app purchase for a virtual good, and from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in
our operating results, including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize
subscription revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. MAUs
are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.

Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language learning
application or the language learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement
period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. DAUs are a measure of the
consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo. 

Throughout this document, the measurement period for MAUs and DAUs is the three months ended December 31,
2022 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods.

Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to Super Duolingo, including subscribers
who pay for a family plan, and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user
account is treated as a single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and
the count of paid subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members
of a family plan.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the
applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used. These
metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and operate and
have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session activity. If we fail
to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. Because we update the
methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior periods.
Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin, Free cash flow and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at the end of this
letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core
operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information
regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and
others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its
financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst
community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the
use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including
companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces
their usefulness as comparative measures. 

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational
decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Constant currency revenue percentage
change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period
revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period
exchange rates.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding interest (income) expense, net, income tax provision, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and public
company costs and transaction costs related to an acquisition, tender offer-related costs and other expenses. Adjusted
EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. These non-GAAP financial measures are
used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial
measures because we believe that they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are
frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following
table presents a reconciliation of our net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in
accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.

DUOLINGO Q4 / FY 2022

19

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development costs
and purchases of property and equipment, and increased by IPO and public company costs, transaction costs related to an
acquisition, taxes paid related to stock-based compensation equity awards and other costs, as we believe they are not
indicative of future liquidity. Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe
that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in
understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic
opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual
cash flow for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

(1) In addition to stock-based compensation expense, this includes costs incurred related to taxes paid on equity transactions. 

(2) IPO and public company costs include costs associated with IPO readiness incurred in 2021 and costs associated with the
establishment of our public company structure and processes, including consultant costs, a one-time fee associated with the set-up
of our initial proxy statement, and fees paid to consultants and Deloitte for work in connection with remediation of the material
weakness disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 

(3) Represents costs incurred related to an acquisition including due diligence, valuation and integration costs.

(4) Represent costs incurred related to the earn-out payment on the acquisition.

(5) Includes costs related to our tender offer initiated in February 2021.

(6) Represents one-time cash awards to Duolingo contributors under our non-employee volunteer program.
