Dear shareholders,
When Duolingo went public, I said that I planned to dedicate my life to building a future in which, through
technology, every person on this planet has access to the best quality of education. And not only that, but a
future in which people want to spend their time learning. I’m proud to say that this year we made significant
progress towards this vision. Our language learners spent close to a billion hours on our app, and we showed
that they can learn the equivalent of five university semesters of language education in half the time. This is
nothing short of remarkable.

We had a number of significant achievements in 2021: 

­

We went public and shared our story in our own, uniquely Duolingo way

­

We saw strong user growth across all regions, especially Asia, and ended the year with record-breaking
DAUs and MAUs (successfully lapping COVID lockdowns)

­

We rapidly grew paid subscribers, adding nearly one million new ones

­

We launched our Family Plan subscription package, which allows up to six members to enjoy the premium
benefits of Duolingo Plus, and which we believe will help us further grow paid subscribers and retain them
better

­

We made the Duolingo app more engaging by adding social features, further rolling out our cast of
characters, and adding even more delightful animations

­

We continued securing our place in popular culture as a shorthand for language learning with millions of
engagements across all social media channels, especially TikTok

­

We expanded our team by approximately 150 new employees, two-thirds of whom are in engineering,
product and design, all while we were hiring the necessary finance and accounting employees to operate
as a public company;£

­

We celebrated the five-year anniversary of the Duolingo English Test (DET). Since its inception, the DET has
successfully disrupted the language assessment market, driving the shift to online testing and capturing
significant market share, with plenty of growth opportunities ahead.

Financially, we generated positive operating cash flow of $9 million for fiscal 2021. Since we went public, we
had IPO-related stock-based compensation and public company readiness costs, which contributed to our net
loss of $60 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis*, we delivered free cash flow of $13 million and achieved
near-break-even Adjusted EBITDA. This shows that we continue to manage our business with the same
discipline as when we were not monetizing our products at all.

* Please refer to the Appendix at the end of this letter for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure.

In the fourth quarter:

]

We accelerated our growth and achieved records in nearly all metrics, including active users, paid
subscribers, and top-line results?

]

Our MAUs increased 15% to 42.4 million and our DAUs increased 20% to 10.1 million compared to the prior
year quarter;W

]

We added a record number of paid subscribers to reach 2.5 million by the end of the quarter, an increase of
56% over the prior year quarter?

]

Total bookings grew 59% and revenue grew 51% compared to the prior year quarter;

This performance brings our full year 2021 bookings and revenue growth both to 55% compared to the full
year 2020. 


Here in our first quarterly shareholder letter, I want to elaborate on these highlights and on what we’re looking
forward to in 2022. But first, I will go over our mission and strategy, and how they contribute to our strong
results.

Taking the long view

Our mission to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available drives everything we
do. I believe that being a mission-driven company is what has led to our success because rather than spending
most of our resources on short-term gains like performance marketing, we take the long view and continually
improve our products and our brand.

Executing our strategy

Our strategy has five elements that create a powerful flywheel: grow users, teach better, grow subscribers,
become the proficiency standard, and expand beyond language learning. The more active users we have, the
more paying subscribers we will have, which means higher revenues that can be invested in teaching better
and becoming the proficiency standard, which in turn attract more users. And, while language learning is a
huge market opportunity, learning in general is even bigger. So as we look to 2022 and beyond, we plan to use
our position as a market leader in language learning to expand to other areas of education. 


Below I lay out how we performed on each of our five strategy dimensions in 2021.

6

Grow Users
We are proud to be the most downloaded language app worldwide. Even though we have started spending on
marketing, particularly in underpenetrated markets, in 2021, about 90% of our growth came organically
through word of mouth. Our learners come from every country in the world and have a variety of reasons to
learn a new language, from economic betterment, to entertainment, to brain training, to culture and family. But
regardless of their motivation, they consistently tell us that we are changing their lives and that they share
their love of our products with their friends. 

Our user growth is the direct result of our obsession with creating engaging products that teach effectively. In
2021, we added or optimized a number of features to increase user retention and word of mouth growth. One
of my favorite areas of improvement has been making the Duolingo app more social, which not only increases
engagement, but creates network effects. Learners on Duolingo can follow, share their progress with, and
send encouraging congratulatory messages to each other. Throughout the year, the fraction of DAUs that send
or receive a congratulatory message on a given day grew from 1% to 10%, and today almost 25% of our DAUs
follow at least three other learners.

We also made several improvements to our streak and Leaderboards features. A streak measures the number
of consecutive days a learner has used Duolingo. In 2021, we optimized how we display the streak to
emphasize its importance, resulting in an impressive 1.5 million DAUs with a streak of over 365 days (meaning
they have used Duolingo every day in the last year or longer!). Our Leaderboards intelligently group learners
into leagues to compete for the top spots and move onto higher leagues. More than one million of our DAUs
are in the highest league, called the Diamond League, and each spends on average over three hours per week
learning on our platform.

7

When it comes to our brand, our green owl mascot, Duo, continues to be a hit in popular culture. A prime
example of this is the growing popularity of our TikTok account, which in the last 6 months has attracted
nearly 3 million followers and over 500 million video views, all with basically zero marketing spend.

Our global marketing strategy is to grow brand awareness in established markets and to seed it in new
markets so that our organic, word-of-mouth growth can take hold. This year we had very successful
campaigns that reactivated existing users and attracted new ones. In December, we launched our annual Year
in Review that summarized each learner’s accomplishments in 2021, including their learning stats and unique
learner style. This drove a record number of shares across social media channels, with our hashtag
#Duolingo365 among the top 10 trending topics on Twitter during the campaign.

Another channel of new user growth is our Duolingo for Schools product, a free tool that helps language
teachers track the progress of their students who use the Duolingo app. In 2021, we launched an entirely
redesigned version of Duolingo for Schools that helped us grow adoption in classrooms across the world. We
estimate approximately 40% of U.S. language teachers are using Duolingo in some fashion.

8

Teach Better
During 2021, we made great strides in teaching better. We completely redesigned about 3,000 lessons across
numerous courses in order to teach more comprehensively and ensure that our curricula align more closely
with international language teaching standards. We also focused on developing learners’ conversational skills
by adding lots of new features. For example, we added 30,000 immersion exercises—clever dialogues,
conversations, and reading exercises—to help learners start thinking in the new language. Additionally, we
scaled out our Audio Lessons, which lead learners through realistic conversations and help them practice
speaking the lines they need in real life when communicating in their new language. 

We also enhanced the way we teach grammar by expanding our grammar-focused lessons to more courses
and adding AI-driven personalized “Smart Tip” feedback for when learners make grammatical mistakes.

9

Another focus area for us in 2021 was improving how we teach languages with non-Roman writing systems,
like Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian. To do this, we developed completely new lessons and exercise
types that focus on teaching letters or characters. This was a priority because Asian languages, especially
Japanese and Korean, are among the world’s fastest growing languages to learn.

Teaching better also means making learning more fun. Our colorful cast of characters that live within our
apps and cheer on our learners is a big part of what makes our user experience so entertaining. We have been
busy bringing these characters to life with major enhancements in 2021. For example, we have now launched
unique computerized voices for them in six of our top languages. 


Our characters also appear in Stories, one of our most popular features, which are bite-sized narratives with
fun dialogues that improve reading and listening skills. This year, we published over 2,000 new Stories across
our language courses, nearly doubling the amount from last year. 


To ensure that all our work in teaching better is having an impact, we spend significant effort measuring the
efficacy of our products. We are proud to report that our research showing that completing five units in
Duolingo is comparable to four semesters of university classes has been published as a peer-reviewed article
in the prestigious journal “Foreign Language Annals.” We also released research reports on two additional
studies, accessible from our efficacy page: one showing that completing seven units in Duolingo is comparable
to five semesters of university classes, and another demonstrating that most learners develop levelappropriate speaking skills after completing five units in Duolingo. This research represents real progress
towards achieving our mission of providing high-quality education for everyone.

10

Grow Subscribers
Since none of our learning content is behind a paywall, anyone can download the Duolingo app, use it for as
long as they like, and complete any of our courses free of charge. This has allowed us to scale to over 42
million MAUs. 

Our premium subscription package, Duolingo Plus, gives learners an ad-free experience and many additional
features that enrich their learning. Since we launched Duolingo Plus in 2017, we have consistently increased
the percentage of learners that pay for a subscription by running thousands of A/B tests that make the paid
experience more valuable. In 2021 the fraction of Duolingo Plus subscribers went from 4% to 6% of MAUs, and
we have a long roadmap of tests that we believe will continue increasing this ratio in the years ahead. 

Continuous product improvements not only increase the propensity of learners to subscribe, but also help
retain them better. During the year, our paid annual subscriber retention went up by several percentage points.
This allows us to deliver better engagement and education, and also benefits us financially by increasing the
lifetime value of our customers. 

Another way we have benefited our learners and also increased their lifetime value is by increasing our mix of
annual subscriptions, which ended the year at about 85%, up from 71% at the end of 2020. 

We believe we can further improve retention and increase our average bookings per subscriber through our
new Family Plan package, in which up to six members can enjoy the benefits of a Plus subscription. We’re
encouraged by the early results of Family Plan, and look forward to increasing its visibility within the Duolingo
app. 

A final noteworthy achievement of 2021 in terms of growing subscribers was the success of our New Year’s
promotion, which is the only time of the year we offer a discount. The results of this year’s discount, which ran
from December 28th through January 31st, were above our expectations, and drove a meaningful increase in
new subscribers.

11

Become the Proficiency Standard
When we launched the Duolingo English Test, our goal was to make high-stakes English proficiency testing
more accessible. We made a test you could take on your computer, from anywhere, in a reasonable amount of
time, and decided to charge $49 per test as opposed to the over $200 that incumbent tests were charging. We
have seen rapid adoption of the DET over the past two years as the pandemic accelerated the acceptance of
online assessment. This year, we saw the DET get accepted by even more institutions and we saw students
increasingly choose to take it. This led DET revenue to grow by 63%.

And we are just getting started. During the fourth quarter, the Irish government announced that it would begin
accepting the DET for student visas. We’ve always known there is an enormous opportunity to expand the DET
beyond higher education and this represents our first step in this direction.

We are already the most downloaded language learning app globally, and we believe we can achieve similar
success in testing and assessment. Our goal is to connect our test’s proficiency scores with our language
learning app to become the standard way people talk about how fluent they are—instead of a learner saying
they are “intermediate” in French, we want them to say they are a “Duolingo 65” in French. We believe
becoming this type of standard will further our competitive advantage as the brand people think about when
they think about language learning.

Franck M., from the Democratic Republic of Congo, took the Duolingo English Test on his path to Columbia University (Class of ‘23)
where he is studying computer science.

12

Expand Beyond Language Learning
As we shared during our IPO, language learning is a $60 billion plus market opportunity that is growing and
rapidly shifting online, and we believe we can capture a sizable portion of it. And while for many Duolingo has
become synonymous with language learning, our mission is about education in general, so in the coming years
we will be expanding to other subjects like early literacy and math. For early literacy, we launched Duolingo
ABC on iOS over a year ago, and we’re currently working on making it more engaging, on expanding its
curriculum to more advanced reading levels, and on an Android version of it that we plan to launch this year. 

We believe we can make our new products succeed by reusing many components of the infrastructure that
made the Duolingo language learning app successful, like our AI-based personalized teaching, our A/B testing,
and our gamification. We also believe Duolingo for Schools, our Family Plan subscription package, and the love
that millions of people have for our brand will provide strong tailwinds for adoption of our products in new
verticals. For example, by including a premium version of Duolingo ABC or our math app in our Family Plan, we
can channel the success of Duolingo to these new products.

Commitment to our Employees
We are an engineering- and product-driven company, and to remain that way, we believe we need to continue
to reinvest our profits into talent. This year we added over 100 new engineers, product managers and
designers to further improve our existing products and launch new ones to attract more learners. This creates
a virtuous circle of new user growth that leads to subscriber and profit growth, which in turn leads to hiring
more product and engineering talent. In the coming years, we plan to continue investing significantly in
growing our talented engineering, product, and design teams.

In 2021, we had less than a 6% attrition rate, much lower than the industry average, especially in a year
marked by high levels of employee transition and resignation in the tech space. We continue attracting and
retaining amazing talent because Duolingo is recognized as a great place to work, thanks to our missiondriven and fun culture.

What to Expect in 2022
We plan to continue managing the business with cost and capital discipline while investing in R&D to drive
growth. Duolingo is known as a market leader with a strong track record of product innovation, and we expect
2022 to be no different. In addition to running thousands of A/B tests to optimize our metrics, we have a
number of product improvements in the works, some of which are described below:
Ä We’re planning to introduce an entirely new design of the Duolingo app home screen that should encourage
learners to be even more engaged­
Ä We’ll continue making Duolingo more social with features that allow learners to interact with each other.
We believe that following friends not only increases accountability, but also drives engagement and makes
learning more fun;

13

) We’ll more heavily promote our Family Plan, which we believe will further increase subscriber retention
and eventually help us expand to other education verticals
) We’ll be making Duolingo for Schools more valuable through mobile and in-class experiences;&
) We’ll continue to grow acceptance of the DET at institutions around the world, especially in Canada, the
U.K., and Australia, and we’ll experiment with new value-added features
) We’re refining our Duolingo ABC app with a fresh design to increase adoption, engagement, and learning
efficiency
) And we are excited to launch a math app towards the end of the year.
Stay tuned for updates on these and other product developments in the coming quarters. Or better yet,
download our apps and experience them for yourself!

In Closing
We have a large and growing market opportunity with nearly two billion language learners worldwide. Today a
majority of language education is still taking place in person, but the shift to digital is rapidly accelerating and
we’re in a great position to not only drive that shift but to directly benefit from it, furthering our mission, and
impacting more peoples’ lives. Despite how far we’ve come since we first launched our language learning app,
we are still in the early stages of growth and are excited about the many attractive opportunities in front of
us.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to our team, whose tireless efforts and dedication make
Duolingo such a great product and company. And I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your
commitment and continued support.

Summary of financial and operating metrics

* Please refer to the Appendix at the end of this letter for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure.

16

In the fourth quarter, total bookings reached an all-time high of $90.8 million, growing 59% year-over-year.
Subscription bookings grew 61% year-over-year to a record $69.8 million, driven by the growth in paid
subscribers and the continued shift to annual plan subscriptions. 

Our full year 2021 total bookings and subscription bookings were $294.2 million and $224.5 million,
respectively. Total bookings grew 55% year-over-year and subscription bookings grew 56% year-over-year.

17

In the fourth quarter, revenues were $73.0 million, growing 51% year over year. In 2021, revenues reached
$250.8 million, growing 55% year over year. The main driver was an increase in subscription revenue, which
was due to an increase in the average number of paid subscribers during the twelve months ended December
31, 2021 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

Non-subscription revenues reached an all-time quarterly high of $21.9 million, growing 62% year-over-year.
This revenue includes advertising, in-app purchase (IAP), and Duolingo English Test revenue. A growing portion
of this revenue is from IAPs because we made significant progress this year in optimizing how learners use
those purchases to enhance their Duolingo experience.

18

Gross margin was 72.7% in the fourth quarter, and it was 72.4% for the full 2021 year. The slight decline in the
fourth quarter from the year ago quarter was driven by additional proctoring costs in our DET business. On an
annual basis, gross margin grew about 80 basis points in 2021, primarily driven by higher subscription
margins due to improved retention, and increased advertising margins driven by an increase in average ad
revenues per DAU, which was partially offset by a decrease in Duolingo English Test margins driven by
increased proctoring costs.

19

Total GAAP operating expenses were $70.5 million and $241.6 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2021,
respectively. We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and Development (R&D), Sales and
Marketing (S&M), and General and Administrative (G&A). 

GAAP R&D expense increased from 32% to 41% of revenue during the fourth quarter and from 33% to 41%
during the year. The increase for both periods is mainly attributable to our growth in headcount leading to an
increase in employee costs. R&D continues to be our largest operating expense as we invest heavily in it in
order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction, which we believe helps to drive organic growth in
MAUs and DAUs. This in turn drives additional growth in, and better retention of, paid subscribers, as well as
increased advertising opportunities with free users.

GAAP S&M expense remained consistent at 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter and increased from 22% to
24% of revenue for the year. In absolute dollar terms, the increase in GAAP S&M expense was primarily driven
by spending on performance marketing where we found opportunities to grow quality DAUs at low cost and by
brand marketing in priority markets such as Japan, India and Southeast Asia. 

GAAP G&A expense decreased from 43% to 35% of revenue during the fourth quarter, and increased from 27%
to 31% of revenue in 2021 compared to the prior year. The main driver of this increase is IPO-related stockbased compensation and public company readiness costs.

20

Non-GAAP operating expenses represent GAAP expenses adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based
compensation, IPO and public company readiness costs, as well as other expenses. For reference, in 2021, we
recognized $40.8 million in stock-based compensation. A majority of this was related to the expenses driven
by the IPO and from the achievement of certain performance hurdles for our founder share grants. You can
find a reconciliation of these items at the end of this letter.

Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased from 29% to 35% of revenue in the fourth quarter, and from 31% to 36% in
2021. The absolute dollar increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount over these periods. We
continued to invest in R&D by adding engineers, product managers and designers throughout the year, and as
we have described elsewhere in this letter, plan to continue to do this in 2022 and beyond. 

During the fourth quarter, non-GAAP S&M declined slightly as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior
year quarter, and remained flat on an annual basis. The absolute dollar increase in non-GAAP S&M expense
during 2021 was described above.

Non-GAAP G&A declined slightly in the fourth quarter and full year 2021 as a percentage of revenue, as
compared to the prior year periods. The absolute dollar increase in non-GAAP G&A for both periods was
primarily related to higher professional fees and return to office expenses. 

We expect to achieve leverage in both S&M and G&A expense over the long-term.
21

As we have since our founding, we continue to manage the business with cost and capital discipline, and as a
result achieved nearly break-even Adjusted EBITDA results for the full year 2021. In addition, we generated
positive free cash flow for both the full year and the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as
net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment, capitalized
software development costs, and increased by IPO and public company readiness costs, taxes paid related to
stock-based compensation equity awards and other costs, as we believe they are not indicative of future
liquidity. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this letter.

Adjusted EBITDA declined to $0.3 million and a loss of $1.1 million during the fourth quarter and full year
2021, respectively, driven by growth in non-GAAP operating expenses, which grew at a quicker rate than
revenue and gross profit for these periods.

22

During the fourth quarter and full year 2021, we generated $1.6 million and $12.7 million in free cash flow,
respectively. The decline from the prior year periods was primarily driven by a decrease in net cash provided
by operating activities. During 2021, we also incurred higher capital expenditures and capitalized software
development costs.

23

1Q22 and FY22 guidance

Duolingo is providing the following guidance for the first quarter and the full year ending December 31, 2022.

With regards to the Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA outlook provided above, a reconciliation to GAAP net loss has not been
provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net loss cannot be calculated or
predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based
compensation expense requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not
currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses
depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons,
we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially
unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Conference Call

Duolingo will host a conference call to discuss its quarterly results today, March 3, 2022 at 5:30 p.m. ET. The live
webcast of Duolingo’s earnings conference call will be publicly available and can be accessed at
investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website one hour following completion of
the call.

About Duolingo

Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. With over 500 million downloads and 42 million monthly
active users, its flagship app has organically become the world's most popular way to learn languages and the topgrossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the Apple App Store. With technology at the core of
everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide learners a fun, engaging, and effective learning
experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the best education in the world and make it
universally available.

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase
of a subscription to Duolingo Plus. Total bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase of a subscription
to Duolingo Plus, a registration for a Duolingo English Test, an in-app purchase for a virtual good and from advertising
networks for advertisements served to our users. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating
results, including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription
revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. MAUs
are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.

Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language learning
application or the language learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement
period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. DAUs are a measure of the
consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo. 

Throughout this document, the measurement period for MAUs and DAUs is the three months ended December 31,
2021 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods.

Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to Duolingo Plus and had an active
subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a single paid subscriber
regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid subscribers does not include
users who are currently on a free trial.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.
Please refer to the definitions and reconciliations at the end of this shareholder letter. We use these non-GAAP
financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period
comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe
that Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance.
Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for
additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational
decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze
the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial
measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation
from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry,
may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as
comparative measures.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding interest (income) expense, net, income tax provision, depreciation
and amortization, Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and public company readiness costs, stock-based compensation
expenses related to equity awards, tender offer-related costs and other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is used by
management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present Adjusted EBITDA because we
believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that it is frequently used by analysts, investors
and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following table presents a reconciliation of our
net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment,
capitalized software development costs, and increased by IPO and public company readiness costs, taxes paid related
to stock-based compensation equity awards and other costs, as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity.
We believe that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors
and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be
used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash
provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP,
to free cash flow.
