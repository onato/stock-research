The company has a clear path to sustained high growth (25-35%) with margin expansion, driven by Max tier adoption, international expansion, and operating leverage. Strong balance sheet ($1.1B cash, no debt) provides downside protection. However, meaningful risks exist: DAU growth is decelerating significantly (30% in Q4 2025 vs 54% in 2023), AI disruption from ChatGPT/Claude is real, and the recent CFO departure raises execution concerns. The low 8.8% conversion rate suggests monetization challenges. For investors with 3-5 year horizon who believe in AI-powered differentiation and management's ability to navigate competitive threats, current valuation offers attractive risk/reward. Not suitable for investors concerned about near-term growth deceleration or AI disruption risk.",
