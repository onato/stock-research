    "fcf_calculation": "Trailing 12-month FCF (Q4 2024 + Q1-Q3 2025) = $87.8M + $53.9M + $70.5M + $77.4M = $289.6M. This represents ~38.7% FCF margin on $748M FY2024 revenue, though Q4 2024 had exceptionally strong cash generation ($87.8M on $209.6M revenue).",
    "one_time_items": "Q3 2025 net income of $292.2M includes $222.7M one-time tax benefit. Normalized net income would be ~$69.5M. This does not materially impact FCF analysis.",
    "equity_growth_rationale": "Shareholders' equity grew from $584.8M (Q4 2023) to $1,258.0M (Q3 2025), representing 53.6% CAGR over ~1.75 years. This rapid growth reflects strong profitability inflection as company scales. However, using revenue CAGR (42%) as primary growth input given equity can be volatile for high-growth companies.",
    "growth_deceleration": "DAU growth decelerated from 40% YoY (Q2 2025) to 36% (Q3) to ~30% (Q4 prelim). QoQ growth slowed from 15% (Q1) to 4% (Q4). This deceleration is reflected in conservative base case growth assumptions.",
    "ai_impact": "Video Call (GPT-4 powered) and Max tier represent key bull case drivers but also introduce margin pressure from variable AI costs. Management noted gross margin pressure despite favorable revenue mix shift.",
    "competitive_risks": "Bear case weighted toward AI disintermediation risk from ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini and AI-native competitors like Speak. Low 8.8% subscriber penetration suggests potential value proposition weakness.",
    "valuation_context": "Base case intrinsic value of $219 implies ~44% upside from $152.64 current price. Bull case of $361 implies 136% upside. Even bear case IV of $126 is only 18% below current price. Probability-weighted IV of $222 implies ~45% upside. Stock appears significantly undervalued at current levels. Entry price of $124 (base case) is only 19% below current price."
