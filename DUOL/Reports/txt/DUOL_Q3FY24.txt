Dear shareholders,
I’m thrilled to share that Q3 was another great quarter, exceeding our expectations for top line, profitability, and
user growth. We showcased several exciting product announcements at Duocon and, because we feel good about
our trajectory for the remainder of the year, we’re raising our guidance.

Third quarter highlights
•

•

Total bookings were $211.5 million, an increase of 38% from the prior year quarter;
Subscription bookings were $176.3 million, an increase of 45% from the prior year quarter;
Paid subscribers totaled 8.6 million at quarter end, an increase of 47% from the prior year quarter;
Daily active users (DAUs) were 37.2 million, an increase of 54% from the prior year quarter, and monthly
active users (MAUs) were 113.1 million, an increase of 36% from the prior year quarter;
Total revenues were $192.6 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year quarter;
Net income was $23.4 million, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year quarter;
Adjusted EBITDA was $47.5 million, compared to $22.5 million in the prior year quarter, a 24.7% versus
16.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively; and
Net cash provided by operating activities was $56.3 million, compared to $37.7 million in the prior year
quarter, and free cash flow was $52.7 million, compared to $33.5 million in the prior year quarter.

Compounding DAU growth
Our 50%+ year over year DAU growth is especially impressive considering that we’re building on 60%+ growth in
the third quarter of last year. We have been able to sustain this growth rate because we constantly improve
features that were already considered home runs, like launching Friends Streak as an extension of one of our most
powerful retention mechanics. What we’ve learned from over a decade of building habit-forming products is that
these minor improvements compound over time.
More than half of our top-of-funnel growth in the past year has come from returning users who have been inactive
for over a month. This highlights our success in reigniting engagement with our platform, which we believe is due
in part to our social-first marketing strategy that keeps us top of mind. We’ve also seen an 80% increase in social
media impressions in the past year, thanks to our expanding reach in channels like YouTube Shorts.
The growth in intermediate English learners on our platform presents an additional long-term opportunity. We
now have over 2 million DAUs learning intermediate English on our platform. Given the enormous global demand
for learning English, we believe our investment in more advanced content can yield meaningful user growth.

Improving conversation skills with Video Call
In Q3, we announced new GenAI-powered product enhancements that are transforming the learning experience on
Duolingo.
The biggest announcement was our new Video Call feature within Duolingo Max, our highest subscription tier. This
feature allows users to practice conversation skills through video calls with our purple-haired, teenage character
named Lily in a low-pressure environment. Lily also remembers past interactions, like my love for tacos or my
recent trip to New York. This makes the experience feel more personal and brings our characters to life.
Video Call marks a big step towards offering a tutor-like experience, especially for English learners. In fact, early
data show that, on average, English learners are using this feature about twice as much as other language
learners.
Video Call is available to nearly all Duolingo Max subscribers. As of the end of the third quarter, Duolingo Max was
available to about half of our DAUs and we’ll scale it to more users, primarily on Android, by the end of the year.

Video Call is a conversational feature available to Duolingo Max subscribers

Closing
Thank you to everyone who tuned into Duocon in September. We set a new record for live viewership this year,
three times higher than last year.
As we head into the final stretch of the year, we have a lot to look forward to. This includes our Year in Review, a
social feature for learners to share their achievements, and our New Year promotion—the one time a year we
discount our subscription—which is perfectly timed for learners making fresh resolutions.
Sorry, I’m getting a video call from Lily, gotta run!

In Q3, total bookings were $211.5 million, growing 38% year over year on a reported basis (39% on a constant
currency basis), driven primarily by a 45% increase in subscription bookings on a reported basis (46% on a
constant currency basis). Revenues totaled $192.6 million in Q3, representing a 40% increase on a reported
basis (41% on a constant currency basis), driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which grew 49%
year over year on a reported basis (50% on a constant currency basis), and comprised 82% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of paid subscribers year over year.

Total gross margin was 72.9% and 73.7% during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. This decline was due to a combination of lower margins in other revenue offset by an increase in
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue.

G&A

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and
other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q3 2024 was for stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses
related to equity awards of $30 million. Approximately 15% of our SBC expense in Q3 was related to our preIPO founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as our founders’ sole equity award opportunity through
2031.
In Q3, we achieved leverage across total operating expenses and for each category of operating expense, both
on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, because we continued to scale our revenue faster than our operating
expenses. GAAP R&D expense decreased from 37% to 33% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis,
R&D expense decreased year over year from 27% to 24%. GAAP S&M expense decreased from 16% to 13% of
revenue year over year as we continue to leverage our past learnings to allocate spending strategically,
improving user acquisition efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, S&M expense decreased year over year from 15%
to 12%. GAAP G&A expense decreased from 24% to 20% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A
expense decreased year over year from 15% to 13%.

In Q3, Adjusted EBITDA† increased by $25.0 million year over year to $47.5 million, a 24.7% Adjusted EBITDA
margin†. The increase in margin was driven by growth in revenue and improved leverage across all categories
of operating expenses.
During Q3, we generated free cash flow (FCF)† of $52.7 million, a 27.3% FCF margin†, driven primarily by an
increase in cash from operations. Cash from operations increased mainly due to generation of higher net
income during the current period.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation
to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not
been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income cannot be
calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stockbased compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted
and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and
regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately
forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable
information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its third quarter and full year results today, November 6, 2024, at 5:30
p.m. ET. This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at
investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion
of the webcast and will remain available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo
Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the
Apple App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide
learners a fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the
best education in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on
those periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on
those periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates
of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how
our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform
that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks
user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations
may be inaccurate. We believe that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable
period of measurement, and that the methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these
metrics are reasonable bases to identify trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we
employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other
companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q3 / FY 2024

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA;
Adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively,
the “non-GAAP operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and
reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational
decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not
be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial
measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial
measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our
institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there
are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these nonGAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues, which exclude the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons
and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from
period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We calculate constant
currency revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues and translating them to constant currency
using prior year comparable period exchange rates for the entire period of related bookings. Constant currency
revenue percentage change is calculated by dividing the difference between constant currency revenue and the prior
year comparable period revenue by the prior year comparable period revenue.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, transaction costs related to acquisitions, acquisition
earn-out costs and loss on disposal of leasehold improvements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted
EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and
marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective
GAAP operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to
equity awards, and, as applicable, transaction costs related to an acquisition, acquisition earn-out costs and loss on
disposal of leasehold improvements. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the
financial performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that
they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts,
investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables present a
reconciliation of our net income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial measures
presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating
expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development
costs and purchases of property and equipment and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation
equity awards and transaction costs related to acquisitions as we believe such items are not indicative of future
liquidity. Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash
flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in
understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for
strategic opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not
represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The
following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable
financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
