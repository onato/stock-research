DUOLINGO Q3 / FY 2025

Dear shareholders,
2025 is shaping up to be another standout year for us. Through the first nine months, DAUs and revenue are
both up 40% or more compared to the same period last year, and we continue to expand profitability. In Q3, we
crossed an important milestone: more than 50 million people now use Duolingo every day. We also saw chess
become our fastest-growing subject, had our biggest brand moment in Asia by partnering with Luckin Coffee,
and launched a LinkedIn integration so learners can showcase their Duolingo Score.

Over 26,000 Luckin stores in Asia partnered with us, selling more than 10 million Duolingo-branded drinks in two weeks.

DAUs grew 36% year over year in Q3, even on top of an exceptional Q3 last year. Growth was slightly slower
than Q2 in part because we posted less “unhinged” content on our English-speaking social media accounts as
we listened to community feedback and prioritized building long-term brand sentiment. We recently started
posting more unhinged content, and while impressions haven’t yet reached peak volume, we’ve seen a
significant increase in them. We also modestly increased marketing spend to help drive momentum,
particularly in the US. These actions support near-term user growth, but long-term gains will come from
making our product even more engaging and effective.

Taking the long view
One of our five operating principles is “take the long view.” The opportunity ahead of us is to teach billions of
people, and while we’ve made incredible progress, we know we’re early in our journey.
We focus on three core areas as we look to continuously improve our product: monetization, user growth, and
teaching better across all our subjects. Each impacts our financial results on a different timeline. Monetization
improvements, such as getting more users to subscribe, show up immediately. User growth improvements
take longer to show up in our finances, since it takes time for people to subscribe. And teaching improvements
take the longest, since they take time to improve user growth, which in turn takes time to improve
monetization.

DUOLINGO Q3 / FY 2025

4

One of the most important parts of my job is balancing among these three core areas, both in terms of relative
investment and navigating tradeoffs between them. For example, changes that boost subscriptions may have a
negative impact on free user growth, so we have to determine what tradeoff makes sense.
In Q3 we decided to shift the balance towards longer-term initiatives. In particular, we’re investing
proportionally more in teaching better, and we’re prioritizing user growth over monetization in the A/B tests
that get launched. This shift is reflected in our full-year guidance. We’re doing this now because we want to
keep growing users for a long time, and because of our increasing conviction that AI can fundamentally change
what’s possible in how we teach. If we develop an app that is more engaging than, and teaches as well as, a
personal tutor across multiple subjects, we think we’ll become a much bigger business in the long-term.

Looking ahead
As for Q4, I’m excited about a number of product initiatives. We’ve introduced player-vs-player on our chess
course, a new flashcards exercise for better word memorization, and a new guided Video Call format that
should help increase Max adoption. Q4 also brings two of our biggest annual events: Year in Review and our
New Year’s Promotion. Both are high-impact events with global reach that we believe will set us up for a strong
finish to the year.
Take the long view,

Luis von Ahn
CEO and Co-Founder

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights
Q3 2025 was another strong quarter, marked by continued top-line momentum and user growth. Total
bookings grew 33% year over year, or 31% on a constant currency basis. Revenue grew 41% year over year, or
42% on a constant currency basis. Net income benefited from the release of valuation allowance of certain
deferred tax assets of $222.7 million during the quarter. And we delivered record Adjusted EBITDA of $80.0
million, expanding year-over-year margin by almost five points to 29.5%.
In Q3, we delivered DAU growth of 36%, even while lapping a strong Q3 2024, which grew 54% year over year.
We also outperformed our expectations for bookings. We continue to see a mix shift toward our higher-priced
subscription tiers, including Max and our family plan, which drove a 7% year-over-year increase in subscription
revenue per average paid subscriber, or ARPU.
Gross margin declined about 40 basis points year over year to 72.5%, as a result of increases in generative AI
and hosting costs. We also achieved operating leverage across both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses,
which led to our highest ever quarterly Adjusted EBITDA.

Q4 and FY 2025 Guidance
Duolingo is providing the following guidance for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2025, and the full year
ending December 31, 2025(1).

Our guidance in the table above assumes foreign exchange rates as of October 31, 2025. On a constant currency basis, assuming the
average foreign exchange rates for Q4 2024 remained constant for Q4 2025, we estimate our Q4 2025 year-over-year growth for
bookings and revenue at 18.2% to 20.4% and 28.2% to 30.1%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, assuming the average
foreign exchange rates for full-year 2024 remained constant for full-year 2025, we estimate our full-year 2025 year-over-year
growth for bookings and revenue at 31.2% to 31.9% and 37.4% to 38.0%, respectively.
With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation to GAAP net
income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been provided as the
quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without
unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards
requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the nonGAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these
expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the
unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

2025 Outlook
Bookings and revenue
Based on our Q3 results and early Q4 trends, we’re raising our full-year bookings guidance slightly at the
midpoint (numbers have been rounded from the table above).
Our guidance reflects the prioritization of short- and long-term investments Luis mentioned above.
•
•
•
•
•

We expect FY 2025 bookings to grow 33% year-over-year, or 32% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint.
We expect FY 2025 revenue to grow 38% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency
basis at the midpoint.
We expect Q4 bookings to grow 22% year-over-year, or 19% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint.
We expect Q4 revenue to grow 31% year-over-year, or 29% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint.
Our outlook reflects exchange rates as of the end of October. As a reminder, over half of our bookings
come from outside the US. So, every 1% change in the dollar versus our currency basket equates to
about a $1 million impact on bookings for the remainder of the year.

Gross margin
We expect FY 2025 gross margin to decline about 80 basis points year-over-year. This is a 20 basis points
improvement from the guidance we provided last quarter, which reflects lower-than-expected AI costs.

Adjusted EBITDA
Based on strong year-to-date top-line growth and continued cost discipline, we’re raising our full-year Adjusted
EBITDA margin guidance to 29.0% at the midpoint, representing an expansion of about 330 basis points over
last year and about 25 basis points above the midpoint of our previous guidance. This implies a full-year
incremental margin of 37.9%, demonstrating our ability to deliver operating leverage even as we invest for
growth.
For Q4, we are guiding to an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.0% at the midpoint, reflecting our continued
investment in product-led AI initiatives and marketing.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its third quarter results today, November 5, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. ET.
This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at
investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following
completion of the webcast and will remain available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
September 30, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on
those periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
September 30, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on
those periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, the majority of which are twelve months in duration.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our
user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is
used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and
operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session
activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. We believe
that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, and that the
methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these metrics are reasonable bases to identify
trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics
may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q3 / FY 2025

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, constant currency measures, non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and nonGAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP operating expenses”), free cash flow, and free cash flow margin.
Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures
for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By
excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these nonGAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we
believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional
information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making
and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of
our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and
these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from,
our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as
comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues and bookings, which exclude the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a
means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate
comparisons and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary
significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We
calculate constant currency revenues by translating current period foreign currency revenues using prior-year
exchange rates applied consistently over the full revenue recognition period. We calculate constant currency
bookings by using current period foreign currency bookings and translating them to constant currency using prior
year comparable period exchange rates. The constant currency percentage change for revenues and bookings is
calculated by dividing the difference between the constant currency amount and the prior year comparable period
amount by the prior year comparable period amount.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, transaction costs related to
acquisitions and acquisition earn-out costs. Beginning in Q3 2025, we expanded our Adjusted EBITDA definition
to include integration costs related to acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a
percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing,
and general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP
operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to
equity awards, and, as applicable, transaction costs related to acquisitions and acquisition earn-out costs.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our
business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are helpful in
highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other
interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables present a reconciliation of our
net income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in
accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses,
respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capitalized software development costs
and purchases of property and equipment. Beginning in Q1 2025, we have aligned our calculation of free cash flow to
this definition, and prior periods in this letter have been recast to conform to this presentation. Free cash flow
margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that Free cash flow is a measure of
liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating
the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or
investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow
for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation
of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
