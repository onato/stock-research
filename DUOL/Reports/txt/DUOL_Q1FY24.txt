Dear shareholders,
2024 is off to a strong start. Here’s a summary of our first quarter results:

First quarter highlights
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Total bookings were $197.5 million, an increase of 41% from the prior year quarter;
Subscription bookings were $161.5 million, an increase of 47% from the prior year quarter;
Paid subscribers totaled 7.4 million at quarter end, an increase of 54% from the prior year quarter;
Daily active users (DAUs) were 31.4 million, an increase of 54% from the prior year quarter, and monthly
active users (MAUs) were 97.6 million, an increase of 35% from the prior year quarter;
Total revenues were $167.6 million, an increase of 45% from the prior year quarter;
Net income was $27.0 million, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the prior year quarter;
Adjusted EBITDA was $44.0 million, compared to $15.1 million in the prior year quarter, a 26.3% versus
13.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively; and
Cash flow from operating activities was $83.5 million compared to $29.6 million in the prior year quarter,
and free cash flow was $79.6 million compared to $28.8 million in the prior year quarter.

The strength across all these metrics shows that we continue to execute well on our strategy.

What to expect in 2024
We’ve raised our guidance for bookings, revenue, and profitability for the full year because we’re excited about our
near-term opportunities, which remain consistent: user growth, optimized subscription conversion and tiers, and
family plan.
We believe our user growth will stay strong because of word-of-mouth appeal, our ability to increase engagement
through continuous product improvements, our international growth opportunity, and our creative marketing. In
the first quarter, we saw our DAU/MAU ratio reach a record 32%, and we grew social media impressions
significantly thanks to viral content and campaigns, including our Super Bowl ad, which helped drive brand buzz.
We started Q2 strong with our April Fool’s brand moment.
In terms of monetization, we recently increased the rollout of Duolingo Max, our highest subscription tier with
generative AI features, and we expect to continue optimizing our subscription tiers throughout the year. We also
plan to continue improving our family plan, which is still in its early days. We recently made it easier to find and
add your family members, and next month, we’ll experiment with a new feature, called Family Quest, that
encourages families to work together towards a common goal (see screenshots below).

Family Quest

Growth beyond 2024
Looking beyond 2024, our growth strategy remains focused on leveraging our core competencies: an engaging
user experience, a freemium business model, data-driven decision making and a robust experimentation
infrastructure, and a distinct brand identity.
• We have created a fun, engaging, and effective product that learners love, and also helps them feel good
about how they spend their time;
• Our freemium model has established us as the category leader and helped us scale to the point where our
learners complete over one billion exercises every day;
• We use this massive collection of data to run hundreds of experiments each quarter, and we combine that
output with AI to create personalized learning experiences in order to fuel user growth and engagement,
efficacy, and monetization;
• We’ve made our brand more iconic, especially our mascot Duo, and both have become synonymous with
gamified learning.
Over time, these capabilities are what we will use to grow the number of English learners and subscribers on our
platform, and how we will expand beyond language learning with new subjects like music and math.
Our English learner initiative is not only fundamental to our mission, but also it builds on our strengths, and we
believe it will provide additional growth over the long term. Although the vast majority of language learners in the
world are learning English, they represent less than half of our DAUs. We believe that offering more advanced
English content will allow us to attract more learners and meaningfully expand our user base. We significantly

DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2024

5

expanded our roll out of such content last fall, and now more than one million DAUs interact with it. We also just
released a stand-alone intermediate-level English course, which only has exercises in English, and can be used by
any learner regardless of their native language. We believe this will allow us to expand our user base more rapidly
in more geographies.
Our latest efficacy research published in a peer-reviewed journal shows that beginner-level English learners
achieved standardized proficiency scores higher than the level of Duolingo course material they completed,
showing that learning English on Duolingo is already highly effective, especially for beginners. Additionally, two
recent studies by independent university researchers show that Duolingo English learners in Colombia and Spain
gain more proficiency than students in a classroom. This is a good indicator that our ongoing improvements to our
English offering are paying off.
In terms of expanding beyond language learning, we’ve been investing in our music and math courses, which apply
our successful gamification approach and empower users to learn these subjects in a fun and approachable way.
We believe that a lot of what we’ve unlocked in language learning applies to these subjects, and that we can create
meaningful businesses out of them.

In closing
We plan to keep investing in innovative ideas that we expect to pay off for many years to come. If you’d like to learn
more about our product-led growth and innovation, check out some of our senior leaders talking about our
product principles and our approach to risk-taking.
Until next time, don’t forget to get your tickets to Duolingo on Ice!

In Q1, total bookings were $197.5 million, growing 41% year over year on a reported basis (and 42% on a
constant currency basis), driven primarily by a 47% increase in subscription bookings on both a reported and
constant currency basis. Revenues totaled $167.6 million in Q1, representing a 45% increase on both a reported
and constant currency basis, driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which grew 53% year over
year, and comprised 79% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of paid subscribers year over year.

Gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year to 73.0% in Q1. This was primarily due
to a higher subscription gross margin contribution from an increase in subscriber revenue as a percentage of
total revenue. This was partially offset by lower advertising gross margin, which was driven by lower
advertising revenue per DAU and increased amortization of capitalized software.

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and
other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q1 2024 was for stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses
related to equity awards of $26 million. Over one fifth of our SBC expense in Q1 was related to our pre-IPO
founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as our founders’ sole equity award opportunity through
2031.

In Q1, we achieved significant leverage across total operating expenses, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis,
because we scaled our revenue faster than our operating expenses. GAAP R&D expense decreased from 40%
to 30% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expense decreased year over year from 31% to
22%. GAAP S&M expense decreased from 14% to 12% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, S&M
expense decreased year over year from 13% to 11%. GAAP G&A expense decreased from 26% to 21% of
revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A expense decreased year over year from 16% to 14%.

In Q1, we achieved our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA†, which increased by $28.9 million year over year to
$44.0 million, a 26.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin†. The increase in margin was driven by growth in revenue and
improved leverage across all categories of operating expenses.
During Q1, we generated our highest quarterly free cash flow (FCF)† of $79.6 million, a 47.5% FCF margin†,
driven primarily by an increase in cash from operations. Cash from operations increased mainly due to
generation of net income during the current period and differences in the timing of amounts received from our
payment service providers in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation
to GAAP net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has
not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net (loss) income cannot
be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares
granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax
and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be
accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable
information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its first quarter and full year results today, May 8, 2024, at 5:30 p.m.
ET. This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at
investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion
of the webcast and will remain available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo
Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the
Apple App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide
learners a fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the
best education in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
March 31, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
March 31, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates
of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how
our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform
that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks
user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations
may be inaccurate. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics
may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q1 / FY 2024

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA;
Adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively,
the “non-GAAP operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and
reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational
decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not
be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial
measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial
measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our
institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there
are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these nonGAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues, which exclude the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons
and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from
period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We calculate constant
currency revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues and translating them to constant currency
using prior year comparable period exchange rates for the entire period of related bookings. Constant currency
revenue percentage change is calculated by dividing the difference between constant currency revenue and the prior
year comparable period revenue by the prior year comparable period revenue.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, acquisition earn-out costs, and gain on
sale of capitalized software. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.
GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and
administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses
excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as
applicable, transaction costs related to an acquisition and acquisition earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial
measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present these
non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results
and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our
industry. The following tables present a reconciliation of our net (loss) income and GAAP operating expenses, the
most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development
costs and purchases of property and equipment and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation
equity awards as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity. Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash
flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful
information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity
and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. Free
cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures
and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by
operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free
cash flow.
