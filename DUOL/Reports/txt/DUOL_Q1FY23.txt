Dear shareholders,
In Q1 2023 we outperformed our expectations for user growth, bookings, revenue, and profitability.  
Here’s a summary:

Q1 Highlights
ª Duolingo DAUs increased 62% to 20.3 million and MAUs increased 47% to 72.6 million, compared to the
prior year quarterz
ª DAU/MAU, a measure of user engagement, reached an all-time high of 28%;
ª The number of paid Super Duolingo subscribers totaled 4.8 million at the end of Q1, an increase of 63%
compared to the prior year quarterz
ª Total bookings grew 37% and revenue grew 42%, compared to the prior year quarter (42% and 47%,
respectively, on a constant currency basis)z
ª Our net loss was $2.6 million, and we delivered our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million,  
or a 13% margin.

Based on this performance, we are raising our top-line guidance for 2023 to reflect 30% year over year
growth, and tightening our target Adjusted EBITDA margin range to 11-12% for the year.  

Our results were strong mainly because we continue to improve the Duolingo language learning app along
three dimensions: teaching efficacy, user engagement, and monetization. On top of that, we believe that our
marketing through organic social media, influencers, and paid user acquisition keeps getting more effective.  
I encourage you to read our previous shareholder letters to learn more about these initiatives. In this letter, I’ll
describe how we expect artificial intelligence (AI) to remain a competitive advantage for us, and briefly touch
on our progress toward profitability.

AI and Education Make a Great Duo
Since Duolingo’s inception, we have bet on AI to accelerate our efforts to make high-quality education available
to everyone. We’ve been building our AI team for more than ten years and have created proprietary systems
that now drive many aspects of our products and business, putting us in a position to benefit from the latest
advancements in generative AI. 

We deploy AI in user-facing and internal capacities. For learners, Birdbrain is our proprietary machine
learning model that makes Duolingo more personalized and effective. Using data from more than one billion
exercises completed each day on the Duolingo app, Birdbrain chooses exercises that are at just the right level
of difficulty for every individual learner.

DUOLINGO Q1 2023

The Duolingo English Test (DET) uses AI in every step of its process, from creating content at scale, to
administering, scoring, and securing the test. In fact, the DET has been working with OpenAI since 2021, long
before GPT became a household name. We’re also creating the testing industry’s first set of standards for how
AI should be used responsibly.

In addition, we’re using AI to accelerate the pace of adding intermediate and advanced course content in our
language learning app. In the past, it would take our experts a lot of time to create the thousands of sentences
and exercises we add to each course over time. Now, GPT-4 can generate these in seconds, freeing our experts
to focus on even more impactful ways of improving our courses. 

Finally, as I mentioned in last quarter’s shareholder letter, we have introduced two AI features as part of our
new subscription tier, Duolingo Max, that are built with GPT-4: Explain My Answer and Roleplay. Both of these
features are aimed at teaching better by emulating a human tutor experience. Duolingo Max is still in its
infancy, and our teams are excited to roll it out more broadly, improve subscriber engagement, and test new
features to make it an even more compelling offering.

How AI Fits Into Our Competitive Advantage
While being a launch partner for GPT-4 gave us a head start on using this latest model, it's important to
remember that our competitive advantage comes from our vast user data, in-house machine learning and AI
expertise, gamified approach, and brand
yw Thanks to the over one billion exercises our learners complete every day, we believe we have more
insights on language learning than any other entity in history, creating a large data moat around our
business
sw We’re not using GPT-4 “off the shelf.” We’re combining GPT-4 with our proprietary machine learning
systems and signature gamified approach to make our products more engaging. We believe this will lead to
more people telling their friends and family about us
w Our engaging and delightful cast of characters and design elements have put us on the path to becoming
an iconic brand. Our beloved characters, especially our mascot Duo, alongside our powerful brand have
made us synonymous with language learning in large parts of the world and bolstered our organic growth.

Profitability
This quarter we achieved a 13.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin. That means that about 32% of our year-over-year
incremental revenue flowed through to the bottom line. We did this while also hiring more than 30 people into
the business as we continue to invest in our products. We will keep running the company with discipline, and
expect to deliver meaningful leverage in operating expenses, putting us well on the path to our long-term
target of 30-35% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

In Closing
I have never been more excited about applying advanced technology to our mission than I am now. The pace of
change is incredible and seems poised to accelerate. With that in mind, I believe the company that learns the
fastest and that integrates technological advances most rapidly will pull away. At Duolingo, we have always
learned rapidly—constant testing and iteration are core to our business—and I’m confident that we are wellpositioned to take advantage of this exciting new era in technology. 

Until next time, see you on the leaderboards!

Summary of Financial and Key Operating Metrics

(1) Please refer to the Appendix at the end of this letter for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

Amounts reported in millions are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components reported in
millions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. In addition, percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying numbers in thousands and may not add to their respective totals due to rounding.

In the first quarter, total bookings grew 37% year over year on a reported basis (and 42% on a constant currency basis)
to a record high of $140.1 million. This was primarily driven by a 40% increase in subscription bookings due to an
increase in the average number of paid subscribers. We also continue to see a shift to higher lifetime value plans.
Subscribers on our annual and family plans made up about 92% of subscribers compared to about 87% in the prior
year quarter.

In the first quarter, revenues grew 42% year over year on a reported basis to $115.7 million (and 47% on a constant
currency basis), driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which comprised 75% of revenue and grew 49%
year over year. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily driven by a higher average number of paid
subscribers. The table below provides revenues by product type:

Gross margin decreased by approximately 80 basis points year over year to 72.8% in Q1. This was primarily driven by
lower advertising margins during the period due to lower advertising revenue per DAU, in addition to increased
amortization of capitalized software. This was partially offset by higher subscription margins due to a greater
proportion of our subscriber base renewing their subscriptions after one year, driving a reduction in third-party
payment processing fees per subscriber.
*Other primarily includes in-app sales of virtual goods.

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing (S&M), and
General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses adjusted for depreciation,
amortization, stock-based compensation, and IPO and public company costs, as well as other expenses. The majority of
the adjustment in Q1 2023 was for stock-based compensation (SBC) expense of $21.1 million. Roughly a third of our
SBC expense was related to our pre-IPO founder equity awards which are intended to serve as the sole equity award
opportunity for our founders through 2031. As a reminder, these founder awards are meant to align our founders’
economic interests with those of shareholders because they vest, in part, based upon the achievement of stock price
hurdles that, if achieved, would result in significant value creation for our equity holders. However, they are expensed
even if none of the stock price hurdles are achieved. The next hurdle would be achieved if our stock price averaged
$178.50 per share for 60 days.

In Q1, GAAP R&D expense increased from 37% to 40% of revenue year over year, primarily due to growth in headcount
as we continue to invest in engineering and product talent in order to improve our products, drive new user growth, and
increase engagement. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expense slightly decreased year over year from 32% to 31%.

We continue to achieve leverage in S&M expense on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis by applying our past learnings  
in order to spend marketing dollars strategically and acquire users more efficiently. In Q1, GAAP S&M expense
decreased year over year from 18% to 14% of revenue, and non-GAAP S&M expense decreased year over year from
18% to 13% of revenue. 

We have also achieved significant operating leverage in G&A since our IPO. In Q1, GAAP G&A expense decreased year
over year from 33% to 26% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis in Q1, G&A expense decreased year over year from 19%  
to 16%.

comparable GAAP financial measure.

We continue to manage the business with cost and capital discipline and are making progress towards our 2023
revised target range of 11-12% Adjusted EBITDA margin†. In Q1, Adjusted EBITDA† increased by $11.2 million year
over year to $15.1 million, a 13.1% margin. The increase was driven by growth in revenue, and improved leverage in
operating expenses. 

During Q1, we generated $28.8 million in free cash flow (FCF)†, a 24.9% FCF margin†, driven primarily by an increase in
cash from operations.

Q2 and FY 2023 Guidance
Duolingo is providing the following guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2023.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation to
GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been
provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net loss cannot be calculated or
predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based
compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and
market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory
reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted.
For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could
have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its first quarter results today, May 9, 2023, at 5:30 p.m. ET. This live
webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at investors.duolingo.com. A replay will
be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion of the webcast and will remain available
for a period of one year.

About Duolingo

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase
of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase of any
Duolingo subscription offering, a purchase of a Duolingo English Test, an in-app purchase of a virtual good, and from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our
operating results, including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize
subscription revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. MAUs
are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo. 

Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language learning
application or the language learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement
period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. DAUs are a measure of the
consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo. 

Throughout this document, the measurement period for MAUs and DAUs is the three months ended March 31, 2023 and
the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods. 

Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering and
had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a single
paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid subscribers
does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family plan.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our
user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is
used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and
operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session
activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. Because we
update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior
periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA
margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP
operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at
the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as
a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our
recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental
information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by
management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and
the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations
related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to,
not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies,
including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which
reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational
decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Constant currency revenue percentage
change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues
where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating Expenses
and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding interest income, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization,
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, IPO and public company costs, acquisition earn-out
costs, and gain on sale of capitalized software. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage
of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and
administrative expenses. These non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses
excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as
applicable, IPO and public company costs and acquisition earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial measures are used
by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial
measures because we believe that they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are
frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following
tables present a reconciliation of our net loss and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial
measure presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating
expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development costs
and purchases of property and equipment and increased by IPO and public company costs, and taxes paid related to
stock-based compensation equity awards, as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity. Free cash flow
margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a measure of
liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating the
strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in
our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow for
discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation of net
cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with
GAAP, to free cash flow.

(1) In addition to stock-based compensation expense, this includes costs incurred related to taxes paid on equity transactions. 

(2) IPO and public company costs include costs associated with the establishment of our public company structure and processes,
including consultant costs, a one-time fee associated with the set-up of our initial proxy statement, and fees paid to consultants and
Deloitte for work in connection with remediation of the material weakness disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(3) Represent costs incurred related to the earn-out payment on an acquisition.

(4) Represents proceeds from a sale of capitalized software.
