Dear shareholders,
In the third quarter we delivered strong learner, subscriber, and bookings growth, while also being Adjusted
EBITDA positive. Based on this outperformance, we are raising our guidance for full year 2022.
o For the fifth quarter in a row, we saw accelerating user growth on Duolingo: DAUs increased 51% to 14.9
million and MAUs increased 35% to 56.5 million, compared to the prior year quarterH
o Paid Super Duolingo subscribers increased 68% to 3.7 million, compared to the prior year quarterH
o Total company bookings grew 41% and revenue grew 51%, compared to the prior year quarter.

I’m particularly proud that we continue to improve Duolingo’s engagement metrics, as we know that daily
usage leads to better learning outcomes. For example, our DAU to MAU ratio is now 26%, up from 24% a year
ago. Features like our streak mechanic, which rewards consecutive days of activity, are a big reason why
learners continue to stay engaged day after day. Today, 2.3 million of our DAUs have a streak longer than 365
days, and 10 million have a streak longer than 7 days.

Our mission to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available drives everything we
do, including the core elements of our strategy: grow users, teach better, grow subscribers, become the
proficiency standard, and expand beyond language learning. In this letter, I will update you on how we are
executing against each of these elements.

Product Improvements Drive Monetization
Super Duolingo subscriptions accounted for 75% of our revenue in Q3. As I’ve mentioned in the past, we’re still
in the early days of monetization and our main strategy element to increase it is to Grow Subscribers. There
are three main ways you can expect us to grow subscribers over the next few years
 Increase our number of active users, as they create a bigger pool of potential paid subscribersH
 Increase conversion from free to paid users by making Super Duolingo more valuable through premium
features and better in-app merchandising like purchase page optimization, packaging and pricing, and
Super Duolingo advertisements in the appH
¯ Increase retention of paid users through product improvements and a shift to higher retaining plans such
as the family plan.

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

Practice Makes Perfect
Practice Hub is an example of a premium feature that makes Super Duolingo more valuable to subscribers.
This quarter, we’ve redesigned this feature to serve as the home for all modes of personalized review, where
learners can easily practice recent mistakes and work on areas of development. Additionally, the new Practice
Hub introduces two daily drills that review past Units and give more practice with speaking and listening, the
two most requested skills.

Timed Challenges Call for More Gems!
Beyond Super Duolingo, we also monetize our free and paying learners through in-app purchases (IAPs). In the
past, our monetization team’s focus was mainly the subscription product, but we have recently started
devoting more energy to boosting IAPs, which now make up 5% of our bookings (up from about 3% a year ago).
The main source of IAPs is learners buying “gems,” a virtual currency that can also be earned as a reward for
doing well in lessons. Gems can be used to get power-ups and access gamified learning experiences.

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

6

An exciting new gem feature that we recently launched is Match Madness, a flashcard-inspired challenge
where learners match as many words to their translations as possible before the timer runs out. Learners can
use gems to purchase timer boosts and climb to higher levels, earning progressively more XP, or experience
points, along the way. We’ve been optimizing this challenge through A/B testing, and it’s become a popular
feature that’s increasing in-app purchases.

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

Measuring Efficacy
Another key part of our strategy is to Teach Better. Our goal is to get learners to B2 on the CEFR scale, which
is generally the minimum proficiency level required to get a knowledge job using that language. About half of
our learners are learning English, so I’m proud to highlight our latest research study that shows strong
learning outcomes in English. In particular, the results showed that learners reached high-intermediate levels
for reading, and mid-intermediate levels for listening.

We’ve achieved these efficacy results by investing heavily in course improvements over the last few years. For
example, we’ve redesigned many of our existing English courses, adding more advanced content and new
exercise types that more effectively immerse learners in the language so that they shift from “translating in
their heads” to “thinking in English.” Coupled with high engagement, these course improvements are helping
learners reach their language goals.

As we continue to teach better, add more advanced content, and get our learners to higher levels of
proficiency, we are making meaningful progress towards our goal of Becoming the Proficiency Standard,
which I'll discuss later in this letter.

Building an Iconic Brand with Efficient Marketing
Marketing campaigns that center around cultural trends have proven to be a cost effective way to Grow Users.
This is why we partnered with HBO to promote learning High Valyrian on Duolingo ahead of the launch of
House of the Dragon, one of the biggest TV shows of 2022. This partnership has been our most successful PR
campaign to date, generating hundreds of press mentions, and millions of social media video views and
impressions. We attracted hundreds of thousands of new users to the High Valyrian course, and based on what
we’ve seen in the past, nearly half of these learners will stick around to learn another language with Duolingo.
In total, we spent less than $150 thousand on this entire campaign.

Expanding Adoption of the Duolingo English Test
We continue making progress towards Becoming the Proficiency Standard in English testing with the
Duolingo English Test (DET). Our goal is to lower the barriers to education by providing a more accessible
option for students around the world to demonstrate their English skills. The Duolingo English Test is delivered
online, without a testing center, and is available on demand, 24 hours a day, for only USD$49. Today the
Duolingo English Test is accepted by over 3,800 higher education programs.

This quarter, we added a major innovation to the test by expanding our pool of questions using human-in-theloop artificial intelligence to create and launch over 1,200 new test questions. Having a larger pool of
questions increases test security by reducing the rate at which questions are exposed, thus lowering the
likelihood of cheating.

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

Duolingo English Test revenue growth was 22% in Q3 2022, down from 66% in the prior quarter. Our year over
year growth decelerated, but as we have said before, the DET operates in a complex ecosystem, so it will have
less linear or predictable growth in any given quarter than the Duolingo language learning app. Over the long
term, we believe that the future of standardized assessment is online, and there is enormous potential for
growth in this market.

Duolingo Math… Out Now!
One of our strategy elements is to Expand Beyond Language Learning, and I’m proud to share that our newest
app, Duolingo Math, is now on the Apple App Store. The math app joins Duolingo ABC, our early childhood
literacy app, as one of our products teaching new subjects. While it’s too soon to report on the performance of
the Math app, you can read more about it in our latest blog post. Better yet, download it now and try it for
yourself!

The Gunner Acquisition
In October we announced the acquisition of Gunner Made LLC, a Detroit-based design and animation studio.
Gunner has been our partner since 2020, animating and bringing life to our products and our brand marketing
campaigns. Art and animation are foundational to our brand and help make Duolingo a beloved daily habit for
millions of learners, so we’re excited to level-up our art and animation teams with Gunner. Here is a recent
example of their work promoting Duocon 2022:

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

10

In terms of our capital strategy, our first priority will remain reinvesting in our business in order to continue
driving organic growth. After that, we will selectively deploy capital against strategic M&A, and Gunner is a
great example of this.

New Year’s is Just Around the Corner
There is a lot to look forward to as we approach the end of the year. We’re excited about our year-end
marketing campaigns and our New Year’s promotion, since we expect that they will drive significant
subscriber growth.

In closing, I’d like to thank the entire Duolingo team for shipping great work this quarter, from the Product,
Design, and Engineering Teams’ launches, to the Marketing Team’s creative campaigns, to the People Team’s
successful integration of our first acquisition.

Until next time, don’t forget to do your daily lessons!

Summary of financial and operating metrics

(1) Please refer to the Appendix at the end of this letter for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Amounts reported in millions are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components reported in
millions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. In addition, percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying numbers in thousands and may not add to their respective totals due to rounding.

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

In the third quarter, total bookings grew 41% year over year (about 48% on a constant currency basis) to $102.7 million.
Subscription bookings grew 42% year over year to $78.9 million, driven by the growth in first-time and renewal
subscriptions, and the continued shift to annual and family plan subscriptions, which together comprise 90% of total
subscribers versus 82% in the prior year quarter.


In the third quarter, revenues grew 51% year over year to $96.1 million, driven primarily by growth in subscription
revenue, which comprised 75% of total revenue in Q3 and grew 57% year over year. The increase in subscription
revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the average number of paid subscribers during the period. The table
below provides revenues by product type:

Gross margin increased by 100 basis points year over year to 72.6%, primarily driven by higher subscription margins,
which were offset by lower margins in advertising.

*Other primarily includes in-app sales of virtual goods.

DUOLINGO Q3 2022

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing (S&M), and
General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses adjusted for depreciation,
amortization, stock-based compensation, and IPO and public company costs, as well as other expenses. In Q3 2022, we
recognized $20.5 million in stock-based compensation, roughly a third of which was related to founder equity awards.

GAAP R&D expense decreased from 46% to 44% of revenue year over year. In absolute dollar terms, GAAP R&D increased
by $12.6 million or 43% year over year, to $42.0 million, primarily due to our growth in headcount. On a non-GAAP basis,
R&D expenses decreased from 40% to 34% of revenue year over year. The absolute dollar increase in non-GAAP R&D
expense was $7.4 million, or 29% growth. We continue to prioritize investments in engineering and product talent. This is
what drives our product improvements, which we believe in turn drive organic user growth and engagement, higher free to
paid conversion, and stronger retention of our subscribers.

GAAP S&M expense decreased from 24% to 18% of revenue year over year. In absolute dollar terms, GAAP S&M expense
increased by $2.5 million, or 16% over the prior year quarter, to $17.7 million, driven by higher marketing headcount and
slightly higher external marketing spend. On a non-GAAP basis, S&M expenses declined from 23% to 17% of revenue year
over year. In absolute dollar terms, non-GAAP S&M expense increased $2.1 million, or 15%, over the prior year quarter.

GAAP G&A expense decreased from 47% to 31% of revenue year over year. In absolute dollar terms, GAAP G&A expense
increased $0.6 million, or 2% to $30.2 million. Increases in travel and meals, facilities costs, headcount expenses,
professional fees, transactions costs, and sales and VAT taxes were offset primarily by a decrease in stock based
compensation, which was higher last year due to an acceleration of founder stock options upon the IPO and RSU expense.
On a non-GAAP basis, G&A expenses increased from 17% to 18% of revenue year over year. In absolute dollar terms, nonGAAP G&A expense increased $6.6 million or 59% to $17.7, due primarily to higher headcount, professional fees, rent, web
services, and travel and meals expenses.
†Please refer to the Appendix at the end of this letter for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure.

Adjusted EBITDA† increased by $8.1 million to $2.1 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The
increase was primarily driven by growth in revenue and gross margin.

During the third quarter, we generated $6.1 million in free cash flow†, an increase of $0.9 million over the prior year
quarter, driven by an increase in cash from operations. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as net cash provided by
operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment, and
increased by IPO and public company costs, taxes paid related to stock-based compensation equity awards and other
costs, as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity.

comparable GAAP financial measure.

Q4 and FY 2022 guidance

Duolingo is providing the following guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year ending December 31, 2022.

With regards to the Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA outlook provided above, a reconciliation to GAAP net loss, the most
directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been provided as the
quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net loss cannot be calculated or predicted at this
time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses
related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not
currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses
depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons,
we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially
unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Video Webcast

Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its quarterly results today, November 10, 2022, at 5:30 p.m. ET. This live
webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at investors.duolingo.com. A replay will
be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion of the webcast and will remain
available for a period of one year.

About Duolingo

Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the Apple
App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide learners a
fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the best
education in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase
of a subscription to Super Duolingo (formerly called Duolingo Plus). Total bookings represent the amounts we receive
from a purchase of a subscription to Super Duolingo, a purchase of a Duolingo English Test, an in-app purchase for a
virtual good, and from advertising networks for advertisements served to our users. We believe bookings provide an
indication of trends in our operating results, including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues
because we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to
twelve months. 

Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. MAUs
are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo. 

Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language learning
application or the language learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement
period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. DAUs are a measure of the
consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo. 

Throughout this document, the measurement period for MAUs and DAUs is the three months ended September 30,
2022 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods. 

Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to Super Duolingo, including subscribers
who pay for a family plan, and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user
account is treated as a single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and
the count of paid subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial, or who are non-paying
members of a family plan.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the
definitions and reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and
operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items
that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides
meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial
measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial
measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our
institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are
a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be
considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures
differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding interest (income) expense, net, income tax provision, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and public
company costs and transaction costs related to an acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate
the financial performance of our business and we present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that it is helpful in
highlighting trends in our operating results and that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested
parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following table presents a reconciliation of our net loss, the most
directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment,
capitalized software development costs, and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation equity awards,
IPO and public company costs, transaction costs related to an acquisition and other costs, as we believe they are not
indicative of future liquidity. We believe that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our
management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to
generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. The following table presents a
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

(1) In addition to stock-compensation expense, this includes costs incurred related to taxes paid on equity transactions.

(2) IPO and public company costs include costs associated with IPO readiness incurred in 2021 and costs associated with the
establishment of our public company structure and processes, including consultant costs, a one-time fee associated with the set-up
of our initial proxy statement, and fees paid to consultants and Deloitte for work in connection with remediation of the material
weakness disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(3) Represents costs incurred related to an acquisition, including integration costs.

(4) Represents one-time cash awards to Duolingo contributors under our non-employee volunteer program.
