Dear shareholders,
We’re halfway through 2025, and I’m happy to report another quarter of great results, driven by product-led
growth, a delightful learning experience, and fast iteration. Our user growth and engagement remain strong,
and our subscription performance and profitability exceeded expectations. Based on these results, we’re
raising the midpoint of our full-year bookings guidance to 32% YoY growth on both a reported and constant
currency basis, and the midpoint of our full-year Adjusted EBITDA margin to 28.75%.

User growth and engagement
DAUs grew at 40% year over year, an impressive result given that we’ve lapped Q2 2024, when DAUs grew
59%. This reflects the strength of our global brand and our ability to continuously improve our app.
In addition to feature improvements and marketing, our growth is fueled by moments of delight that keep
learners coming back. That’s why we obsess over making the app more fun and enjoyable, from the lightning
bolt when you ace a lesson or Eddy flexing triumphantly when you answer a hard exercise, to the satisfying
haptic when you nudge your friends. We’ve already shipped dozens of rewarding interactions this year, and
while they may seem subtle, they compound into a product experience that’s increasingly enjoyable.

Our new Chess course has grown faster than any other subject we’ve launched (including language learning!),
with over a million DAUs as of quarter end. And that’s just on iOS and in English (we plan to expand Chess to
Android and more UI languages throughout this year). We have an exciting product roadmap ahead, including
better content for intermediate learners and the ability to engage in matches against others.
Chess is still early, but we believe it has the potential to attract new audiences and deepen engagement with
our existing learners.

Monetization and subscriber growth
Our subscription business continued to perform well, with growth across all tiers. We saw Super grow above
our expectations this quarter driven by strong conversion. At the same time, Max, our highest subscription tier,
has seen significant traction since fully rolling out less than a year ago. We’re excited that we now have
research that shows that Video Call, the flagship feature for Max, is helping learners improve speaking skills.
Looking ahead, we have an exciting roadmap which includes making calls more engaging through gamification,
interactive backgrounds, and longer sessions for learners who can handle them.
We also made progress this quarter on a new core feature designed to boost engagement and conversion:
Energy.
Energy is a pacing system for free users that replaces Hearts. Unlike Hearts, which penalize mistakes, Energy
is usage-based and rewards success—a carrot, not a stick. Each exercise uses a unit of energy, regardless of
whether the answer is right or wrong, but learners get back energy when they get multiple answers correct in
a row. This creates a more motivating and gamified experience, especially for new users who tend to make
more mistakes.
Energy has had encouraging results: our iOS rollout has shown that it increased DAUs, median time spent
learning well, and subscriber conversion. We have rarely seen a feature move more than one of these metrics,
let alone all three. We see a meaningful opportunity to iterate on this mechanic over time, much like we’ve
previously done with Hearts and Streaks.

Closing remarks
We made real progress this quarter on initiatives that we believe will fuel the long-term success of our
business. We believe our mission to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available is
more attainable than ever.
And if you’re curious about what’s coming next, tune into Duocon on September 16 to see more of what we’ve
been building.
See you then!

Second Quarter 2025 Highlights
Q2 2025 saw continued top-line momentum and expanding profitability. Total bookings and revenue both grew
41% year over year, or 39% and 42%, respectively, on a constant currency basis. We delivered record net
income, and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31%, representing over four points of year-over-year margin
expansion.
We delivered DAU growth of 40% in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and a strong result given the
comp from last year’s exceptional Q2. And at the same time we were able to outperform our expectations in our
bookings in Q2. We saw robust subscription bookings across all tiers, and another strong quarter of bookings
from our ads business. Subscription revenue per average paid subscriber, or ARPU, grew 6% year over year,
primarily driven by more subscribers shifting to higher-priced tiers.
We expanded gross margin by 130 basis points to 72.4% from Q1 to Q2, due to lower-than-expected AI costs
and strength in our ads business. While gross margin declined 100 basis points year over year due to higher AI
costs associated with the expansion of Max, that decline was smaller than the 300 basis points we had
anticipated. We also achieved operating leverage across both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses, which
helped drive the increase in Q2 Adjusted EBITDA.

Q3 and FY 2025 Guidance

Our guidance in the table above assumes foreign exchange rates as of July 31, 2025. On a constant currency basis, assuming the
average foreign exchange rates for Q3 2024 remained constant for Q3 2025, we estimate our Q3 2025 year-over-year growth for
bookings and revenue at 26.3% to 28.2% and 34.3% to 36.4%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, assuming the average
foreign exchange rates for full-year 2024 remained constant for full-year 2025, we estimate our full-year 2025 year-over-year
growth for bookings and revenue at 31.6% to 32.5% and 35.5% to 36.6%, respectively.
With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation to GAAP net
income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been provided as the
quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without
unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards
requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the nonGAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these
expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the
unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

2025 Outlook
Bookings and revenue
Based on our Q2 results and what we’re seeing so far in the third quarter, we’re raising our full-year bookings
guidance (numbers have been rounded from the table above).
•
•
•
•
•

We now expect our FY 2025 bookings to grow 32% year-over-year, on both a reported and constant
currency basis at the midpoint.
We expect our FY 2025 revenue to grow 36% on both a reported and constant currency basis at the
midpoint.
We expect Q3 bookings to grow 28% year-over-year, or 27% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint.
We expect Q3 revenue to grow 34% year-over-year, or 35% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint.
Our outlook uses exchange rates as of the end of July. As a reminder, over half of our bookings come
from outside the US. So, every 1% change in the dollar versus our currency basket equates to about a
$3 million impact on bookings for the remainder of the year.

Gross margin
We now expect FY 2025 gross margin to decline about 100 basis points year over year, which is an
improvement from the guidance we provided last quarter. This is primarily driven by lower-than-expected AI
costs and strength we’ve seen in our ads business.

Adjusted EBITDA
Based on strong year-to-date top line growth and continued cost discipline, we’re raising our full-year Adjusted
EBITDA margin guidance to 28.75% at the midpoint, representing an expansion of about 310 basis points over
last year and about 80 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. This implies a
full-year incremental margin of 37.4%, underscoring our ability to deliver operating leverage, even as we invest
for growth.
For Q3, we are guiding to an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5% at the midpoint. We expect profitability to step
down slightly in the second half of the year as we reinvest a portion of our outperformance back into the
business.

Share count
Finally, we continue to expect fully diluted share count to increase by about 1% in 2025, assuming Q2 quarter
end share price.

Definitions
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
June 30, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
June 30, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those
periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, the majority of which are twelve months in duration.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our
user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is
used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and
operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session
activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. We believe
that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, and that the
methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these metrics are reasonable bases to identify
trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics
may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q2 / FY 2025

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, constant currency measures, non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and nonGAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP operating expenses”), free cash flow, and free cash flow margin.
Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures
for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By
excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these nonGAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we
believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional
information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making
and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of
our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and
these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from,
our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as
comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues and bookings, which exclude the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a
means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate
comparisons and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary
significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We
calculate constant currency revenues by translating current period foreign currency revenues using prior-year
exchange rates applied consistently over the full revenue recognition period. We calculate constant currency
bookings by using current period foreign currency bookings and translating them to constant currency using prior
year comparable period exchange rates. The constant currency percentage change for revenues and bookings is
calculated by dividing the difference between the constant currency amount and the prior year comparable period
amount by the prior year comparable period amount.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, transaction costs related to
acquisitions and acquisition earn-out costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a
percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing,
and general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP
operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to
equity awards, and, as applicable, transaction costs related to acquisitions and acquisition earn-out costs.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our
business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are helpful in
highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other
interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables present a reconciliation of our
net income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in
accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses,
respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capitalized software development costs
and purchases of property and equipment. Beginning in Q1 2025, we have aligned our calculation of free cash flow to
this definition, and prior periods in this letter have been recast to conform to this presentation. Free cash flow
margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that Free cash flow is a measure of
liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating
the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or
investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow
for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation
of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
