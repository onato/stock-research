Dear shareholders,
We delivered another strong quarter, beating our expectations on both the top and bottom line, and on user
growth. Our performance is a testament to the quality of our product and to the strength of our brand. Here’s a
summary of our second quarter 2023 results:

Second Quarter Highlights



DAUs increased 62% to 21.4 million and MAUs increased 50% to 74.1 million, compared to the prior year
quarter|



DAU/MAU, a measure of user engagement, reached an all-time high of 29%;



The number of paid Super Duolingo subscribers totaled 5.2 million at the end of Q2, an increase of 59%
compared to the prior year quarter|



Total bookings grew 41% and revenue grew 44%, compared to the prior year quarter (42% and 46%,
respectively, on a constant currency basis)|



Subscription bookings increased 43% to $106.3 million compared to the prior year quarter|



Our net income was $3.7 million, and we delivered our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $20.9 million,
or a 16.5% margin|



Cash flow from operating activities increased to $37.2 million and we delivered record free cash flow of
$34.3 million, or 27.1% margin.


Based on this performance, we are raising our full-year 2023 total bookings guidance to reflect 33-34% year
over year growth. We are also raising our target Adjusted EBITDA margin range to 14-15% for the year.


In this letter, I want to focus on our unique approach to marketing, why it works, and how it helps with our user
growth. Our marketing efforts have become an increasingly efficient complement to our organic user growth,
and we’ve also been winning awards! In 2022, Ad Age named Duolingo one of its “Hottest Brands.” And this
June, we took home our first Gold Lion award at Cannes for our “High Valyrian Lessons” campaign.

The Most Popular Way to Learn

Duolingo has organically become the most popular way to learn a language. Word of mouth has been our most
powerful growth lever since the beginning and we expect that to continue—we’ve created a beautiful product
that is free, fun, and effective, and because of that learners avidly refer their friends and family. 


We spend relatively little on paid user acquisition, and the vast majority of our users have been acquired
organically, but that doesn’t mean that our marketing isn’t effective. We have tested our way to a marketing
strategy that inserts our brand into pop culture events and social media moments in order to expose it to new
audiences and drive word-of-mouth growth. We call this social-first marketing.

DUOLINGO Q2 2023

Our Social-First Marketing Strategy
“Social-first marketing” means that every campaign we create starts with the goal of driving virality for our
brand. To do that, we create content that delights and engages our audiences, prompting them to share it on
social media. We tap into trending topics or connect with major pop culture moments like the Barbie movie,
which, spoiler alert, includes a scene featuring Duolingo. We also don’t sell directly in our campaigns—you’ve
never seen a “try Duolingo” button on any of our social posts. This strategy is relatively low cost, and has
generated outsized returns in terms of social media impressions, press coverage, and, ultimately, new users
to Duolingo.

A fun example of this is our annual April Fools prank, which went viral in 2019 and is now a yearly brand
moment. It has grown in scale each year, reaching more people and enabling us to partner with bigger brands.
This year, we partnered with NBC’s Peacock to create “Love Language,” a fictitious dating reality TV show in
which contestants don’t speak each other’s language.

Our Learners Are Brand Ambassadors
Our social-first marketing approach has a wonderful brand benefit—fans and users become brand
ambassadors that spread our message. They share their experiences with our products, engage with our
social content, and create their own viral Duolingo memes and lore often inspired by our own social posts. In
fact, we’ve seen user-created content on TikTok and YouTube outpace impressions of our own posts.

DUOLINGO Q2 2023

This organic, user-created content also gives us data and insight into how our brand is perceived around the
world. For example, while our mascot Duo is beloved globally, we’ve discovered that Lily, our purple-haired,
emo teenager is adored by learners in China. Organic fan content devoted to Lily has spread across Chinese
social media. We’ve taken that insight to heart, producing social content using a Lily mascot suit and offering
Lily plushies and stickers in our new merchandise store. 

As a result of this social-first marketing strategy, we’ve become one of the most followed brands on TikTok
globally, and have seen 150% YoY growth in our social media impressions. This, in turn, has driven our brand
awareness and word-of-mouth user growth.

Accelerating Our Mission with AI
In our last letter, I said that we have used machine learning and AI for about a decade to make Duolingo more
personalized and engaging. Over the next decade, we believe these technologies will enable us to accelerate
our ability to provide our learners with an even more fun, personalized, and effective learning experience.
That’s why we’ve been so excited about launching new AI-enabled features into our product like those in
Duolingo Max, the higher subscription tier that we are testing. We’re also applying new generative AI tools
throughout the company. For example, we’re using them to speed up our script-writing for Duolingo Stories
and to more efficiently scale our course content.

We expect to continue integrating AI more and more deeply into everything we do. Using new technologies to
make excellent products takes time to get right, but we think we are uniquely well-positioned to do that—we
have experience with AI and an enormous user base that will help us test new features and products. We are
excited to see what we can build.

In Closing
I’d like to remind everyone to tune in on October 11th to Duocon, our annual event where we discuss all things
Duolingo. It’s a hoot! And I’d like to thank our team for their excellent work this quarter, as always.

Until next time, don’t forget to do your Duolingo!

Q2 23

In the second quarter, total bookings grew 41% year over year on a reported basis (and 42% on a constant currency
basis) to $137.5 million. This was primarily driven by a 43% increase in subscription bookings. Revenues grew 44%
year over year on a reported basis to $126.8 million in the second quarter (and 46% on a constant currency basis),
driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which grew 46% year over year, and comprised 75% of revenues.


The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily driven by a higher average number
of Super Duolingo subscribers. Subscription revenue per subscriber declined 7% year over year, primarily due to
regional pricing and foreign currency changes.

Gross margin increased by approximately 40 basis points year over year to 73.4% in the second quarter. This was
primarily driven by higher subscription margins as a result of a reduction in third-party payment processing fees per
subscriber, as well as improved margins on the Duolingo English Test from higher pricing. These improvements were
partially offset by lower advertising margins during the period due to lower advertising revenue per DAU.

Q2 23

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing (S&M), and
General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses adjusted for depreciation,
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and IPO and public company costs, as well
as other expenses. The majority of the adjustment in Q2 2023 was for stock-based compensation (SBC) expense of
$23.7 million. Nearly a third of our SBC expense was related to our pre-IPO founder equity awards, which are intended
to serve as the sole equity award opportunity for our founders through 2031. As a reminder, these founder awards are
meant to align our founders’ economic interests with those of shareholders because they vest, in part, based upon the
achievement of stock price hurdles that, if achieved, would result in significant value creation for our equity holders.
However, these founder awards are expensed even if none of the stock price hurdles are achieved. The next hurdle
would be achieved if our stock price averaged $178.50 per share for 60 days.

In Q2, we achieved significant leverage across total operating expenses, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  

GAAP R&D expense decreased from 39% to 38% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expense
decreased year over year from 31% to 29%. While we continue to prioritize investment in R&D–primarily through  
hiring talented engineers, product managers, and designers–our top line performance has outpaced our growth in  
R&D expense.

GAAP S&M expense decreased from 17% to 14% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, S&M expense
decreased year over year from 16% to 13%. We continue to see success in applying learnings to more efficiently and
strategically spend our marketing dollars.

GAAP G&A expense decreased from 34% to 25% of revenue year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A expense
decreased year over year from 20% to 15%. G&A has provided the most operating leverage year over year, particularly
in office, legal and accounting expenses, and company-wide events.

We continue to manage the business with cost discipline, and we are making progress towards our 2023 revised target
range of 14-15% Adjusted EBITDA margin†. In Q2, we achieved our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA†, which
increased by $16.7 million year over year to $20.9 million, a 16.5% margin. The increase was driven by growth in
revenue and improved leverage across all categories of operating expenses.

During Q2, we generated our highest quarterly free cash flow (FCF)† of $34.3 million, a 27.1% FCF margin†, driven
primarily by an increase in cash from operations.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation to
GAAP net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not
been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net (loss) income cannot be
calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stockbased compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted
and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and
regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately
forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information,
which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its second quarter results today, August 8, 2023, at 5:30 p.m. ET. This live
webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at investors.duolingo.com. A replay will
be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion of the webcast and will remain available
for a period of one year.

Duolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most
popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the Apple
App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide learners a
fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the best education
in the world and make it universally available.

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase
of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase of any
Duolingo subscription offering, a purchase of a Duolingo English Test, an in-app purchase of a virtual good, and from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our
operating results, including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize
subscription revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.

Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language
learning application or the language learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a
measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. MAUs
are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.

Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique Duolingo users who engage with our mobile language learning
application or the language learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement
period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. DAUs are a measure of the
consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.

Throughout this document, the measurement period for MAUs and DAUs is the three months ended June 30, 2023 and
the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods.

Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering and
had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a single
paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid subscribers
does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family plan.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our
user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is
used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and
operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session
activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. Because we
update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior
periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q2 2023

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA
margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP
operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at
the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as
a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our
recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental
information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by
management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and
the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations
related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in
addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other
companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at
all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. 

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues, which exclude the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons and
better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to
period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We calculate constant currency
revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues and translating them to constant currency using prior year
comparable period exchange rates. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the
change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency
revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating Expenses
and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, IPO and public company costs, and acquisition earn-out
costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses
consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. These non-GAAP
operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization,
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as applicable, IPO and public company costs and
acquisition earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial
performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are
helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other
interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The following tables present a reconciliation of our net (loss)
income and GAAP operating expenses, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with
GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development costs
and purchases of property and equipment and increased by IPO and public company costs and taxes paid related to
stock-based compensation equity awards, as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity. Free cash flow
margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a measure of
liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating the
strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in
our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow for
discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation of net
cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with
GAAP, to free cash flow.
