Dear shareholders,
2023 was a record year that ended with a record quarter. Our user growth accelerated throughout the year, we
achieved record bookings and revenue in both the fourth quarter and the full year, and we became significantly
more profitable. We believe we reached these milestones by making our product more engaging and by
attracting users through several extraordinary brand moments. Here’s a summary of our Q4 2023 results:

Fourth Quarter Highlights
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Total bookings were $191.0 million, an increase of 51% from the prior year quarter;
Subscription bookings were $157.8 million, an increase of 57% from the prior year quarter;
Paid subscribers totaled 6.6 million at quarter end, an increase of 57% from the prior year quarter;
Daily active users (DAUs) were 26.9 million, an increase of 65% from the prior year quarter, and
monthly active users (MAUs) were 88.4 million, an increase of 46% from the prior year quarter;
Total revenues were $151.0 million, an increase of 45% from the prior year quarter;
Net income totaled $12.1 million, compared to a net loss of $13.9 million in the prior year quarter;
Adjusted EBITDA was $35.2 million, compared to $5.2 million in the prior year quarter, a 23.3% versus
5.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively; and
Cash flow from operating activities was $49.2 million compared to $11.6 million in the prior year
quarter, and free cash flow was $47.7 million compared to $11.3 million in the prior year quarter.

Our bookings outperformance was largely driven by strength in family plan bookings and our New Year’s
Promotion (which began at the end of December 2023). These factors also contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA
outperformance.

2023 Was Our Best Year Ever
In 2023, we made a number of product innovations. We launched the Math and Music courses in our main app,
which continued our expansion beyond language learning. We also used generative AI to develop new features
and lesson types that enable more conversational and listening practice, which moved us closer to our longterm goal of teaching as well as a human tutor.
Our brand became more iconic. Our social-first marketing strategy, discussed in last quarter’s letter, earned
nearly 3 billion social media impressions in 2023 (+170% YoY). The iconic Duolingo “ding” appeared in “Barbie”,
the highest-grossing movie of the year. We also won our first Cannes Gold Lion award for our 2022 HBO “House
of the Dragon” campaign.
We scaled our business meaningfully while also becoming more profitable. Our freemium, product-led
business model, coupled with disciplined execution, allowed us to grow users, subscribers, bookings, and
revenue faster than marketing and other operating expenses. By the numbers: DAU growth accelerated
throughout the year, reaching 65% YoY in Q4; for FY 2023, we achieved 45% bookings growth, 44% revenue
growth, and a 13-point increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Looking Ahead to 2024
In 2024, we plan to continue the formula that has worked so well for the past several years: growing users and
subscribers, and teaching even more effectively.
Our success in growing users has come from strong word of mouth growth and a relentless focus on
improving engagement to keep learners coming back. This year we plan to continue to invest in the product
experience by adding new, immersive lesson types, iterating on gamification mechanics and social features,
and improving efficacy, particularly in our English courses (see more below).
We will experiment with our three subscription tiers (free, Super, and Max) to optimize monetization—changing
the look, relative price, features, and even the name of the tiers to help learners select the best option for them.
We will also focus on growing adoption of our family plan. Family plan bookings grew over 100% year over year
in 2023, but family plan subscribers still only make up 18% of all our paid subscribers.
Our efficacy work will focus on English learners. The English-learning market is huge and represents a
mission-aligned growth opportunity. Since many English learners already have a basic grasp of English, we
see an opportunity to better meet their needs by offering improved advanced English courses. In Q1, we’ve
already launched advanced English content to 17 of our courses teaching English to learners across the world.
Finally, we'll continue to build upon our long-term effort of integrating AI into our products to make them more
personalized and engaging.

2024 Financial Profile
2023 was an exceptional year, and yet even on that strong base we expect user growth to moderate only
slightly in 2024. As we’ve said for several quarters, we can’t expect our user growth to accelerate forever. This
makes sense given how rapidly we’ve grown over the past couple of years, going from about 10 million DAUs in
Q4 2021 to nearly 27 million in Q4 2023. So far in Q1 2024, our YoY DAU growth is closer to the mid-50s than
the 60%+ it was throughout 2023.
We expect strong financial performance in 2024 and estimate that we’ll deliver total bookings growth of 28%,
revenue growth of 36% and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.5% at the midpoint of our guidance. This Adjusted
EBITDA margin implies that more than 35% of incremental revenue will flow through to Adjusted EBITDA.
With over 2 billion people learning languages around the world, we see a large market opportunity that we’re
just starting to address. Our recent performance reaffirms our belief that we can achieve our long-term
bookings growth target of greater than 25% per year. And as we showed in 2023, we’re making meaningful
progress toward our long-term Adjusted EBITDA margin target range of 30-35%.

In Closing
As we enter 2024, I want everyone to know that my goal is to maintain the spirit of innovation that we’ve had
since the beginning. Our creativity was on display in our “Superb Owl” campaign, which featured a 5-second
local ad and concurrent push notification during the Super Bowl. In true Duolingo fashion, this scrappy ad was
DUOLINGO Q4 / FY 2023

home-grown, cost us roughly one tenth of the average media spend for a Super Bowl ad, and delivered outsized
social buzz and press coverage (it was featured in The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the WSJ, The New
Yorker, CNBC, etc.). Indeed, Duolingo's social posts received the most likes of any brand on X/Twitter during the
Super Bowl. This is a great example of how our technical and creative excellence combine to create delight for
our current and future learners.
Until next time, no buts….Do your Duolingo!

In Q4, total bookings reached a record high of $191.0 million, growing 51% year over year on a reported basis
(and 49% on a constant currency basis) primarily driven by a 57% increase in subscription bookings. In FY
2023, total bookings were $622.2 million, up 45% year over year on both a reported and constant currency
basis, driven primarily by a 49% increase in subscription bookings.
Revenues grew 45% year over year on a reported basis to $151.0 million in Q4 (43% on a constant currency
basis), driven primarily by an increase in subscription revenue, which grew 50% year over year, and comprised
78% of revenues. In FY 2023, revenues were $531.1 million, 44% higher year over year on both a reported and
constant currency basis, driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue, which was up 48% year over year,
and comprised 76% of revenues.
The increase in both subscription bookings and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in the average number of paid subscribers year over year. In Q4, subscription revenue per subscriber declined
4% year over year, primarily due to stronger growth in non-U.S. countries that have lower average prices,
which was partially offset by foreign currency benefits.

Gross margin decreased by approximately 10 basis points year over year to 73.1% in Q4 primarily driven by
lower advertising gross margin during the period, which was the result of lower advertising revenue per DAU,
offset by higher subscription gross margin contribution from higher subscription revenue mix and slightly
lower subscription margin. In FY 2023 gross margin increased by approximately 15 basis points year over year
to 73.2%. This was mainly due to higher subscription margin, as well as higher margins on the Duolingo
English Test primarily driven by higher pricing. These improvements were partially offset by lower advertising
gross margin.

G&A

We report three categories of operating expenses: Research and development (R&D), Sales and marketing
(S&M), and General and administrative (G&A). Non-GAAP operating expenses† represent GAAP expenses
adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, as well
as other expenses. The most significant adjustment in Q4 and FY 2023 was for stock-based compensation
(SBC) expenses related to equity awards of $27.3 million and $99.2 million, respectively. Nearly one quarter of
our SBC expense in Q4 was related to our pre-IPO founder equity awards, which are intended to serve as the
sole equity award opportunity for our founders through 2031.
In Q4 and FY 2023, we achieved significant leverage across total operating expenses, both on a GAAP and nonGAAP basis.
In Q4, GAAP R&D expense decreased from 43% to 33% of revenue year over year, and in FY 2023, GAAP R&D
expense decreased from 41% to 37% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis†, R&D expense decreased year over
year from 34% to 24% in Q4, and decreased from 33% to 27% in FY 2023. Our product-focused strategy has
delivered meaningful top line growth that has outpaced our investment in R&D. Our R&D expenses are mainly
personnel costs for engineers, designers and product managers who work to improve our products through
experimentation and iteration, aimed to drive user growth and conversion to paid subscribers.

In Q4, GAAP S&M expense decreased from 18% to 13% of revenue year over year, and in FY 2023, GAAP S&M
expense decreased from 18% to 14%. On a non-GAAP basis†, S&M expense decreased year over year from 17%
to 12% in Q4, and decreased from 17% to 13% in FY 2023. We continued to see benefits from our cost-effective,
social-first marketing strategy, and we've seen meaningful improvements in attracting new users more
efficiently over time.
In Q4, GAAP G&A decreased from 30% to 24% of revenue year over year, and in FY 2023 GAAP G&A decreased
from 32% to 25%. On a non-GAAP basis†, G&A expense decreased year over year from 18% to 15% in Q4, and
decreased from 19% to 15% in FY 2023. Year over year operating leverage in G&A primarily came from
employee, office, and travel expenses.

We continue to manage the business with cost and capital discipline. In Q4, we achieved our highest quarterly
Adjusted EBITDA†, which increased by $30.0 million year over year to $35.2 million, or a 23.3% Adjusted
EBITDA margin†. In FY 2023, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $78.2 million to $93.7 million, or a 17.6% Adjusted
EBITDA margin. The increase was driven by growth in revenue and improved leverage across all categories of
operating expenses.
During Q4 and FY 2023, we generated free cash flow (FCF)† of $47.7 million (a 31.6% FCF margin†) and $144.3
million (a 27.2% FCF margin†), respectively, driven primarily by an increase in cash from operations.

With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation
to GAAP net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has
not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net (loss) income cannot
be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for
stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares
granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax
and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be
accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable
information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP
financial results.

Video Webcast
Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its fourth quarter and full year results today, February 28, 2024, at
5:30 p.m. ET. This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at
investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website two hours following completion
of the webcast and will remain available for a period of one year.

Definitions
Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a
purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from
advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app
purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including
cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably
over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.
Monthly Active Users (MAUs). MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs
for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended
December 31, 2023 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on
those periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.
Daily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning
section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the
DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended
December 31, 2023 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on
those periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.
Paid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering
and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a
single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid
subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family
plan.

Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data
We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and
subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates
of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how
our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform
that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks
user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations
may be inaccurate. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics
may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may
calculate these metrics differently.

DUOLINGO Q4 / FY 2023

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are
presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA
margin; non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP S&M expense and non-GAAP G&A expense (collectively, the “non-GAAP
operating expenses”); Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at
the end of this letter. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and
as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our
recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures
are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures
used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional
investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number
of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial
measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues, which exclude the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons
and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from
period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We calculate constant
currency revenues by using current period foreign currency revenues and translating them to constant currency
using prior year comparable period exchange rates for the entire period of related bookings. Constant currency
revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year
comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year
comparable period exchange rates.

Reconciliation: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP Operating
Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income excluding interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, IPO and public company costs,
transaction costs related to an acquisition, acquisition earn-out costs, gain on sale of capitalized software and loss
on disposal of leasehold improvements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and
administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP operating expenses
excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards, and, as
applicable, transaction costs related to an acquisition and acquisition earn-out costs. These non-GAAP financial
measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present these
non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results
and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our
industry. The following tables present a reconciliation of our net (loss) income and GAAP operating expenses, the
most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses, respectively.

Reconciliation: Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capitalized software development
costs and purchases of property and equipment and increased by taxes paid related to stock-based compensation
equity awards, IPO and public company costs, transaction costs related to an acquisition and an acquisition earn-out
payment as we believe they are not indicative of future liquidity. Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow
as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information
to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future
ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow has
certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures and our nondiscretionary commitments. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating
activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.
