=== KEY ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS ===

Revenue Growth Drivers:
1. DAU growth (currently decelerating from 60% to 30%)
2. Subscriber conversion rate (~23% of DAU)
3. ARPU trends (stable at ~$24/quarter, slight uptick recently)
4. New products: Math, Music, Chess expanding TAM
5. International expansion potential

Margin Drivers:
1. Operating leverage (fixed costs spread over larger revenue base)
2. Marketing efficiency (viral/organic growth reduces CAC)
3. AI costs (GPT-4 features may add costs but also premium pricing)

Key Risks:
1. DAU deceleration continues or accelerates
2. Competition from AI-native language learning apps
3. Duolingo English Test (DET) market share loss
4. Key person risk (CEO Luis von Ahn)
5. Subscription fatigue / churn increases

Key Opportunities:
1. Math/Music/Chess become meaningful revenue contributors
2. AI features (Max tier) drive ARPU expansion
3. International markets (India, Southeast Asia) unlock growth
4. Enterprise/education market expansion
5. Potential M&A to accelerate new categories

=== COMPARABLE COMPANY ANALYSIS ===
Company,P/S (TTM),Revenue Growth,EBITDA Margin
Duolingo (DUOL),8x,40%,29%
Spotify (SPOT),4x,19%,12%
Netflix (NFLX),9x,15%,28%
Chegg (CHGG),1x,-10%,15%
Coursera (COUR),3x,8%,-5%

Notes:
- DUOL trades at premium to peers but has highest growth
- P/S of 8x is at historical low for DUOL (median 15x)
- Growth premium appears compressed vs. history
