    "Massive monetization runway: Only 8.8% paid subscriber penetration leaves significant conversion opportunity; mix shift to Max/Family plans driving 6-7% ARPU growth",
    "Expanding TAM beyond languages: Chess (fastest-growing subject), Math, Music attract new demographics and increase engagement/retention beyond core language learners",
