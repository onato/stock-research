Third Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Financial Results
    • Gross Billings came in at $462.8 million dollars, growing 24.9% YoY in USD and 48.1% YoY on an FX Neutral basis, marking 18th
      consecutive quarter of FX Neutral gross billings growth above 45% YoY.

    • Gross billings was solid across main countries on an FX Neutral basis YoY: Brazil 68.6%, Argentina 82.6%, Mexico 83.7%

    • In addition to the solid growth in Gross Billings, increased efficiencies in shipping subsidies also drove strong net revenue growth on an
      FX Neutral basis. Consolidated net revenues came in at $355.3 million dollars, accelerating on an FX Neutral basis 14pp to 58.3% YoY.

    • On a by country basis, net revenue growth was also strong in main countries YoY: Brazil 56.4%, Argentina 67.8%, Mexico 168.2%

    • Gross Profit ascended to $169.7 million dollars, representing 47.8% of revenues vs. 57.7% LY. Most of the year on year margin
      compression is explained by hosting fees, mPos write-offs, & warehousing costs.

    • As reported operating expenses totaled $180.7 million dollars, or 50.9% of revenues vs. 48.6% LY. The YoY contraction is attributed to
      buyer protection payouts, increased loan loss provisions on our credit portfolio, and incremental marketing costs.

    • From a bottom line perspective operating losses showed a 61.0% reduction versus last quarter to $11.0 million dollars or negative 3.1%
      of revenues against negative $28.2 million in 2Q. Additionally we have delivered positive EBITDA as we continue to optimize our
      financial model.

    • Consequently, net loss as reported for the third quarter was also lower versus last quarter, ascending to $10.1 million, resulting in basic
      net loss per share of $0.23 cents.
Third Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Payments – MercadoPago
   • MercadoPago had a stellar quarter once again accelerating growth and scale. During the month of September, for the first time ever not
     only MP processed more total payment transactions off platform that on MELI’s marketplaces, but total payment transactions surpassed
     the one hundred million mark in a single quarter.

   • TPV off Mercado Libre represented over 1/3 of total payment volume during the quarter vs. less than 1/4 a year ago, and explained
     80.0% of the total incremental TPV growth as we focus on growing our O2O initiatives.

   • On a consolidated basis, mPos TPV is growing at 636.0% YoY and quickly gaining share in off platform.

   • During Q3, Wallet reached 1 million active payers in a single month. Active payers grew triple digits YoY in Argentina, Brazil, and
     Mexico.

   • LC TPV from wallet growing at a fast clip in Argentina (+475.0% YoY) and also in Brazil (+126.0% YoY).

   • Launched QR in store payments network in Brazil during the quarter as we continue to expand our efforts in building ubiquity and
     adding more usage cases to our two-sided network.

   • Rolled out Asset Management product in Argentina for individuals with encouraging results. Since its launch, asset management users
     have invested almost 20.0% of MercadoPago stored balances in Argentina.
Third Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Marketplace
   • Marketplace business continues to show great resiliency in spite of increasingly difficult comps. On a consolidated basis FX Neutral
     GMV grew 27.9% YoY, while if we exclude Venezuela from last year FX Neutral GMV grew at a solid 37.7% YoY.

   • Mexico is consolidating as an engine of growth for the business, delivering 7 and 5 consecutive quarters of items growth and FX
     Neutral GMV above 65.0% YoY respectively. Additionally, since early 2017 the size of the business has grown by a factor of 2.5x as we
     leverage our depth and breath of selection, fast and free shipping value proposition and aggressive customer acquisition investments.

   • Brazil sustained 12 consecutive quarters of GMV growth above 30.0% YoY in Brazil on an FX Neutral basis despite tougher two-year
     stack comparisons, shipping subsidy reductions and the launch of R$ 5 flat fee in July for items below R$ 120 free shipping threshold.

   • As a result of launching R$ 5 flat fee rollout in July for items below R$ 120 and removal of all listings under R$ 6, successful items
     growth in Brazil decelerated to 1.5% YoY. However, ASP in Brazil growing sequentially & YoY as we shift incentives and subsidies to
     purchase higher ticket items, and improve monetization and overall unit economics.

   • Despite challenging macro and currency trends during the quarter, Argentina maintained momentum both in successful items and FX
     Neutral GMV growing 49.4% YoY and 48.9% respectively as our free shipping program continues to gain traction and reached almost
     50.0% of sales.
Third Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Logistics - MercadoEnvíos
   • The adoption of our proprietary logistics network is making strides with over 15% of the shipments through MercadoEnvios was sent
     through it during the quarter.

   • Shortened lead times by almost 20% on a consolidated basis over the last year. Brazil is the geography where we observed the
     greatest improvement as we shortened lead times by 1.9 days versus last year.

   • Improving lead times in Mexico and Argentina as well, by approximately 0.5 days in both countries.

   • On our dropship network we have seen important advances during the quarter as we launched our MELI Flex solution in Argentina.
     This application will allow our sellers to leverage our technology and use their existing logistics relationships to deliver goods within
     hours in large metropolitan areas through our MercadoEnvíos proprietary logistics network.

   • During the quarter, on a consolidated basis ~40.0% of items sold were being delivered in 48 hours or less. Mexico leads the way with
     almost 80.0% of the volume being delivered in two days or less, while Argentina and Brazil continued to improve their share of
     shipments in that time window.
