͏MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, November 1st, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://
 www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s leading e-commerce and technology company, today reported financial
 results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

         Net Revenues of $3.8 billion, up 69.1% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis
                  Income from operations of $685 million, with a 18.2% margin
    $47.3 billion Total Payment Volume, up 121.2% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis
   $11.4 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 59.3% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis

                                              To our Shareholders

           We have been investing relentlessly and consistently in our products and services for many years, and
  the powerful impact of these investments on our performance was clear to see in the third quarter of 2023 in
  the form of accelerated growth, customer preference and business profitability. Operational KPIs remained
  strong and even picked up in Q3’23, with growth in items sold accelerating to 26% year-on-year (from 18% in
  Q2’23) and off-platform TPV growing at a faster pace than the previous quarter in all of our three largest
  markets. Our financial performance was equally pleasing. Net revenue of $3,760mn grew 40% year-on-year
  and income from operations more than doubled year-on-year for the fourth successive quarter reaching
  $685mn, with a margin of 18.2%. This shows, yet again, our ability to deliver fast top line growth alongside
  solid profitability, and the business’ potential to generate attractive economics as we scale.

           We have achieved these results whilst continuing to invest on several fronts as we seek to maximize
  MercadoLibre’s growth opportunities. We reached an important milestone in Q3’23 as we relaunched our
  loyalty program as MELI+. We now have an improved program in which we will continue to invest to grow the
  number of members. This process kicked-off in earnest in Brazil and Mexico in late August with high-impact
  marketing campaigns. The revamped bundle offers more free shipping, which is now available to members on
  millions of products from R$29 / MXN149 (vs. the previous free shipping threshold of R$79 / MXN299), free
  content subscriptions to Disney+ and Star+ platforms and a free music subscription to the Deezer platform, as
  well as exclusive offers and discounts. We are pleased with the initial results following the recent relaunch.

          Logistics is another area of investment. In Q3’23, we opened our first regional fulfillment center in Rio
  de Janeiro, which enabled us to increase our same-day shipping promise in Brazil’s second largest
  ecommerce market. We also announced that another facility will open early next year in the state of
  Pernambuco to increase capacity in the northeast region. Furthermore, we expanded one of our facilities in
  São Paulo and are preparing to add new fulfillment centers in Mexico in the coming quarters so that capacity
  keeps up with our volume growth. These long-term investments are designed to maintain our logistics
  competitive advantage, which was apparent in Q3’23 as we hit a record level of fulfillment penetration of 48%
  of shipments (up from 40% in Q3’22) - with Brazil leading the gains, helped by sellers’ NPS for fulfillment
  reaching a record high. Moreover, on-time deliveries hit record levels in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia at
  the same time as we improved the delivery promise on our product pages in all geographies, which positively
  impacts conversion. We also continue to focus on driving productivity and efficiency gains to offset the impact
  of incremental investments as far as possible, and we were successful in doing this in Q3’23, with broadly
  stable net shipping costs as a percentage of GMV vs. Q2’23. We are also pleased to see buyers adopting our
  innovative delivery options, including Meli Delivery Day (part of MELI+) and slower shipping for a lower cost.

            We have also been investing in our credit capabilities, specifically in the credit card product in Brazil
   and Mexico. Additional product development resources have helped strengthen the underwriting models for
   our credit card. This has translated into a material improvement in asset quality over the last 12 months, which
   has enabled us to increase the pace of new card issuance. As a result, we have accelerated the number of
   cards issued in Brazil and Mexico, and credit card TPV surpassed $1bn for the first time, with growth
   accelerating to almost 70% year-on-year in Q3’23. The credit card is in an investment phase as we begin to
   scale the product, which is a key piece of our long-term strategy to be the financial services provider of choice
   for users of our ecosystem.
                                                                                                                      2

                                                     Brazil

         We continue to execute well in Brazil, and Q3’23 was another quarter marked by strong momentum
and market share gains in Commerce. GMV growth accelerated to 28% YoY on an FX-neutral basis, with the
acceleration driven by an increase in items sold, which grew at 27% YoY, the highest rate of growth since
Q4’21. All categories showed double-digit growth in items sold, helped by successful promotional campaigns
in early July and for Father’s Day in August. Our first-party business continues to grow at an accelerated pace,
enabled by material and structural improvements in profitability, and this is helping us to increase our share in
the Consumer Electronics category. In August, we welcomed more than 15,000 sellers to the MercadoLivre
Experience event in São Paulo, the biggest in our history. The event showcased the many tools available to
sellers to help them build and grow their businesses and prepare for this year’s peak season. This included
the launch of a new “Coupon Center”, which enables sellers to create their own discount coupons, as well as
incentives to test fulfillment and ads, and workshops for tools such as Clips, our short format videos, which
drive a 5x increase in product page views and have reached more than 1bn views since launch in Q3’22.

         At the same event, we also launched the MercadoPago credit card for small businesses that use our
marketplace or payments processing services, strengthening the suite of credit products available to
merchants. Our credit products performed well overall in Brazil in Q3’23 as we stepped up the pace of
originations on the back of strong profitability and broadly stable NPLs. We began to offer larger and longer
loans to certain groups of users as part of our strategy to increase engagement with our credit products, which
has various positive knock-on impacts on our ecosystem. Off-platform TPV in Brazil showed good momentum,
with FX-neutral growth edging higher to 42% YoY in Q3’23, with solid growth trends in payments processing
and the digital account. We continue to see rising engagement with the digital account in the form of larger
balances (assets under management more than doubling YoY) and a wider audience, which bodes well as we
position MercadoPago as a comprehensive, everyday financial services solution.


                                                    Mexico

         Mexico’s performance in Commerce continues to excel, and we believe our Q3’23 results show how
well positioned MercadoLibre is to take advantage of the country’s long-term growth potential. GMV growth
remained strong at 34% YoY on an FX-neutral basis, with growth of items sold accelerating to 38% YoY (from
34% in the prior quarter), its highest level since Q1’21. The Home & Industry and Apparel & Sports categories
made the biggest contributions to items sold growth. We achieved fantastic results with the launch of the
latest iPhone model, which represents an important step forward in our first-party and high-ticket strategies.
Cross-border trade is growing well ahead of our overall GMV growth, and we continue to invest in this
business as a strategic priority in Mexico.

         In September, we reached the milestone of off-platform TPV surpassing on-platform TPV for the first
time in Mexico. Online Payments and POS are both performing well, and helped off-platform TPV growth
accelerate to 88% YoY on an FX-neutral basis in Q3’23. We believe this fast pace of growth is driving sizable
market share gains, and also accelerating the adoption of digital payments in Mexico. MercadoPago is
focused on building awareness and engagement following the roll-out of our full product suite to the digital
account in Mexico, and we saw good progress in Q3’23. Mindshare metrics show the brand’s traction building
in recent months, with the highest share amongst non-traditional financial services providers. Our competitive
NPS also improved, which we see as a consequence of a stronger product stack that now includes a credit
card, as well as wider take up of our credit products more broadly. Q3’23 was another good quarter for our
credit products in Mexico with solid growth and profitability.

                                                                                           Q3’23 Results



                                                  Argentina

        Argentina delivered a better performance in Commerce in Q3’23, with items sold growth accelerating
to almost 13% YoY, up from an average of 1% in the previous three quarters. Given the challenging macro
environment in Argentina, we think there has been some pull-forward of demand as the country moved
towards the final stages of this year's elections. We also deployed certain tactical measures to support growth,
such as adjustments to our financing offer, co-financed promotional campaigns with sellers and tweaks to our
marketing strategies.

          As we mentioned last quarter, the strength of MercadoPago’s value proposition is becoming ever-
clearer in this tough environment as consumers in Argentina seek out simple ways to protect their money from
inflation. We believe this was evident once more in Q3’23 as MercadoPago’s “top of mind” score rose
substantially QoQ and YoY, with the number of users of our remunerated account surpassing 10mn for the first
time, and assets rising more than 90% vs. Q2’23 and 5x YoY. This money-in has a positive impact on other use
cases in our digital account, and contributed to off-platform TPV growth of 238% on an FX-neutral basis. This
shows our Fintech operations in Argentina growing substantially ahead of inflation, with the positive gap
between FX-neutral TPV growth and inflation widening in Q3’23 vs. Q2’23. Despite a tough backdrop, we
believe the foundations of our business in Argentina are solid.

                                          Consolidated Results

         We are pleased with our financial results for Q3’23, which was another quarter of strong growth and
profitability. Revenue of $3,760mn grew 40% YoY, with another standout quarter in Mexico (66% YoY) and a
strong performance in Brazil (40% YoY), with both countries outpacing Argentina (22% YoY), whose
contribution to revenue fell to 22% in Q3’23 from 25% in Q3’22. Commerce revenue growth accelerated to
45% YoY due to an increase in services revenues, alongside a broadly unchanged 1P product sales growth
rate of 37% YoY. Fintech revenue growth of 33% YoY accelerated sequentially as we have now lapped last
year’s rapid growth in credit revenues, and we slowly increase the pace of originations.

         Revenue from our advertising services grew above 70% on an FX-neutral basis for the sixth quarter in
succession, and is now equivalent to almost 1.7% of GMV. This high margin revenue had a positive impact on
our Q3’23 gross margin, which was 3.0ppts higher YoY. Other positive drivers of gross margin include scale
and efficiencies in CX (customer experience) and collection fees, fewer POS device sales and higher first-party
product margins. These offset the headwinds from shipping operations (due to the expansion of our fulfillment
footprint), higher credits funding costs and a lower mix of high margin credits revenue.


         Operating expenses fell by 4.3ppts of net revenue YoY as our continued strong growth and cost
discipline enabled us to dilute sales & marketing expenses (despite incremental spend vs. Q2’23) by 0.7ppts
and G&A expenses by 0.5ppts, as well as reduce the YoY deleverage from product development expenses
to 0.2ppts in Q3’23 from 0.7ppts in Q2’23. Provisions for doubtful accounts fell as a percentage of net
revenue YoY due to better asset quality, particularly in Brazil, and the dilutive effect of other businesses
whose revenue growth outpaced credits. The increase in provision expenses on a sequential basis (vs.
Q2’23) was due to the introduction of larger and longer loans for certain users in Brazil and geographic mix
(with Argentina - where credit losses are lowest - losing share in the portfolio).

         Income from operations reached $685mn, growing 131% YoY to hit a new quarterly record. This was
supported by Direct Contribution (DC) growth of 157% in Brazil and 106% in Mexico which, put together,
accounted for 65% of DC and 82% of incremental DC (when comparing Q3’23 with Q3’22). The quarter’s
strong margin performance reflects our ability to leverage our scale as we maintain high rates of growth,
combined with many years of consistent investment in technology. This investment is coming to fruition as a
superior offer to our customers (driving revenue growth), and more efficient internal processes and cost
structures (supporting expense dilution). This reflects the strength and attractiveness of our financial model,
and our focus on executing with excellence.
                                                                                                                   4
                                                                                          Q3’23 Results



         Our net income for the quarter reached $359mn. This includes FX losses (net) amounting to $239mn,
of which $173mn was directly related to our share repurchases in the Argentine market. We also incurred FX
losses of $40mn in US GAAP due to the revaluation of assets & liabilities in Argentina (primarily cash held in
Argentine pesos losing value in US dollars), and this was larger than previous quarters due to the sharp
devaluation of the Peso in mid-August. That said, under local accounting rules, our dollar-denominated assets
in Argentina (primarily intercompany receivables) increased in value in Argentine pesos, creating an FX gain
that led to a $76mn tax charge. There was also a positive one-off impact of $141mn in tax due to the reversal
of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in Mexico as the sustainable profitability the business is now
achieving makes the use of these tax assets probable.

          Given the ongoing depreciation of the Argentine peso vs. the US dollar, we are providing investors
with additional information, including the table below which shows certain P&L items denominated in
Argentine pesos. If we were to simulate the effect of a devaluation equivalent to having translated Argentine
peso revenues and costs to US dollars at the blue chip swap rate, rather than the official exchange rate, for
the nine-month period to September 30, 2023, we estimate that income from operations would have been
$331mn lower than our reported income from operations of $1,583mn. However, we also incurred significant
FX losses related to our Argentine operations as a result of our repatriation of funds via the repurchase of our
own shares in the Argentine market, which amounted to $386mn for the same nine-month period. Those
purchases are made at the blue chip swap rate, which had an average spread of approximately 103% over the
official exchange rate in the nine-month period to September 30, 2023. As a result of our cash management
strategy in Argentina, we believe that our net income and cash flow already incorporate much of the potential
effect of a devalued exchange rate. We estimate the impact of the simulation described above on our net
income for the nine-month period to September 30, 2023, to be broadly neutral to slightly positive.

         Our strong P&L performance was reflected in our cash generation, with cash and cash equivalents up
 by $311mn in Q3’23 vs. Q2’23 and $261mn year-to-date. Capex investments have totaled $329mn so far this
 year as we continue to invest in our logistics network. Debt ratios have improved materially on the back of our
 strong results and cash flow, with net debt to EBITDA falling to less than 1.0x in Q3’23 from 2.5x a year ago.
 We expect those ratios to improve further once we complete the process of redeeming our 2028 convertible
 notes, which we announced during the quarter. We believe our balance sheet is in good shape.



                                              Looking Ahead

          After celebrating another quarter of strong operational KPIs and financial results, our teams are now
 focused on executing another peak season successfully to further extend our leadership in Commerce and
 build on our momentum in Fintech. More broadly, we are particularly pleased that the quarter’s results show
 our ability to deliver operating leverage across our P&L as we scale. This bodes well for the future as we
 remain focused on taking advantage of the many growth opportunities that are open to us, and we are
 optimistic about our ability to do this in a profitable and sustainable manner that creates even more scale in
 the long-term. As such, we continue to invest across the business with confidence that the best is yet to
 come.

(*) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts. Growth calculations based on this table may not total due to rounding.
(**) As from January 1, 2022, we no longer disclose our total volume of payments on marketplace net of shipping and financing fees. Given the growth of our
shipping and fintech businesses, management believes that including shipping and financing fees in the calculation of total volume of payments on
marketplace results in a more accurate indicator of that performance on a go-forward basis. Consequently, total volume of payment on marketplace for the
nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2022 has been recast to include shipping and financing fees.
(***) Net interest margins after losses (“NIMAL”) represents the annualized ratio between the total credits revenues less funding costs and provision for
doubtful accounts for the period and total average gross loans receivable for the period. Management uses NIMAL to monitor how effectively the Company is
pricing and managing the credit products relative to their risk and setting targets. Accordingly, management is of the opinion that NIMAL provides useful
information to investors and others related to the Company’s risk appetite through the different periods and shows how the Company effectively prices risk.

                               Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

          To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest
expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and
amortization and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt and foreign
exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial
measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below.

         These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the
most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

           We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects
for the future.


Adjusted EBITDA

           Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to
eliminate the effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains,
interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in
earnings of an unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used
by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the
calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors
and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In
addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the
effect of certain items.

indicated (in millions of U.S. dollars):

Net debt

            We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other
financial liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding foreign government debt securities restricted
and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have included this
non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios and
set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash flows
and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and
other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of
repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used measures.

FX neutral

        We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by
excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results
and business outlook.

          The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each
month during 2022 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2023, so as to calculate what our
results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below
excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic
effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to
compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

         The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the
operations for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023:
