 FIRST QUARTER 2021 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


▪ Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.4 billion, a year-over-year increase of 111.4% in USD
  and 158.4% on an FX neutral basis.

▪ Commerce revenues increased 139.2% year-over-year in USD reaching $910.6 million, while
  Fintech revenues increased 72.4% year-over-year in USD reaching $467.8 million.

▪ Gross profit was $591.4 million with a margin of 42.9%, compared to 48.0% in the first
  quarter of 2020.

▪ Total operating expenses were $500.5 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year in USD. As
  a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 36.3%, compared to 52.5% during the
  first quarter of 2020.

▪ Income from operations was $90.8 million, compared to a loss of $29.7 million during the
  prior year. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations was 6.6%.

▪ Interest income was $25.1 million, a 31.8% decrease year-over-year, as a result of lower
  interest rates as a consequence of the pandemic and lower float in our U.S. investments,
  mainly offset by higher interest income in Argentina due to higher float.

▪ We incurred $91.3 million in interest and financial expenses this quarter, mostly attributable
  to the convertible debt repurchase transaction.

▪ We had foreign currency losses of $15.1 million, mainly attributable to the additional cost of
  accessing US dollars through an indirect mechanism in Argentina due to restrictions imposed
  by Argentine government for buying US dollars at the official exchange rate.

▪ Net income before taxes was $9.5 million, up from a loss of $16.7 million during the first
  quarter of 2020.

▪ Income tax expense was $43.5 million, driven by higher income tax expense in Argentina
  and Brazil as a consequence of higher pre-tax gain in our Argentine and Brazilian segment in
  2021 and an increase in our withholding tax on dividends.

▪ Net loss was $34.0 million, resulting in net loss per share of $0.68.

▪ As part of our treasury strategy this quarter we purchased $7.8 million in bitcoin, a digital
  asset that we are disclosing within our indefinite-lived intangible assets.

          NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


        To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
        present foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP
        financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure can be found in the tables below.
        This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
        prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
        companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
        principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
        our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure
        should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP
        financial measures.
        We provide this non-GAAP financial measure to enhance overall understanding of our current financial
        performance and its prospects for the future, and we understand that this measure provides useful information
        to both Management and investors. In particular, we believe that FX neutral measures provide useful
        information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that
        may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.
        The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
        2020 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2021, so as to calculate what our results would have
        been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
        allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
        currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
        currency inflation or devaluations.




                The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for
                the three-months period ended March 31, 2021:
