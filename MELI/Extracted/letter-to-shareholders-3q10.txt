BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, Nov. 3, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq:MELI) ( http://www.mercadolibre.com ), Latin America's leading e-commerce technology
company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010.

Marcos Galperin, President and Chief Executive Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented, "We are pleased with our strong third quarter results, which once again benefitted from
sustained secular trends that continue to drive e-commerce growth in the region. Accordingly, we are confident that our platform of complementary offerings is the right

Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results Summary

MercadoLibre reported consolidated net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2010 of $56.0 million, representing 10.6% year-over-year growth in U.S. dollars and
23.2% year-over-year growth in local currencies. Growth rates were negatively impacted since the company began to pre-sell financing receivables, therefore reporting as revenues
for the third quarter of 2010 the net amount collected from these pre-sales. Had financing receivables also been pre-sold during the third quarter of 2009, respective year-over-year
growth in net revenues would have been 19.9% in U.S. dollars and 33.6% in local currencies.

Items sold on MercadoLibre grew 30.1% to 10.4 million while total Payments transactions through MercadoPago grew 120.3% to 1.9 million when compared to the third quarter of
2009. In local currencies, gross merchandise volume and total payments volume grew 26.5% and 63.0% year-over-year, respectively. In U.S. dollars, gross merchandise volume for
the quarter grew 12.3% year-over-year to $888.1 million, while total payment volume grew 66.6% year-over-year to $189.9 million.

Gross profit grew 10.7% to $44.5 million from $40.2 million in the prior year quarter. The third quarter 2010 gross profit margin was 79.5%, flat versus the third quarter of 2009.

Income from operations grew 1.7% to $19.3 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $19.0 million in the third quarter of 2009. Operating income margin for the third quarter
of 2010 was 34.5%.

margin was 33.6% for the third quarter of 2010, compared to 19.5% for the same period last year. Strong net income growth was aided by a one-time tax benefit of $4.6 million.

Change in MercadoPago Financing Operations

Starting in the third quarter of 2010, the company began to pre-sell credit card receivables from its MercadoPago financing operations. For this reason, starting in the third quarter of
2010, MercadoPago financing revenues now represent the net amount received from financing institutions as a result of pre-selling these installment related financing
receivables. Credit card receivables are being pre-sold in order to: (a) better manage credit risk, (b) generate increased predictability of the associated cost and (c) not assume any
financing risk.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules to supplement the company's consolidated
financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do
not reflect all of the amounts associated with MercadoLibre's results of operations as the corresponding GAAP measures.

Reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included at the end of this press
release.

These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance. Specifically, the company believes the non-
GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain compensation expenses and unusual foreign currency effects that may not be
indicative of its core operating results, thereby enhancing an investor's ability to make period over period comparisons of the company's results. The company believes the inclusion
of these non-GAAP measures provides an element of consistency in the company's financial reporting and uses these measures in internal budgets and models and in determining
executive compensation benchmarks.

In this press release MercadoLibre also includes each of net income, earnings per basic and diluted share, blended and effective tax rates and certain margin percentages for the
three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 after excluding (or adding back) the following charges required by GAAP:

Long term retention plan compensation

(a) On August 8, 2008, the Board of Directors approved a long-term employee retention program (the 2008 LTRP) for certain executives based on 2008 performance that will be
payable 50% in cash and 50% in MercadoLibre common stock, in addition to their annual salary and bonus. Payments will be made during the first quarter on an annual basis
according to the following vesting schedule: year 1 (2009): 17%, year 2 (2010): 22%, year 3 (2011): 27%, year 4 (2012): 34%.

(b) On June 10, 2009 the Board of Directors approved a long-term employee retention (the 2009 LTRP) program for certain executives based on 2009 performance. If earned,
payments to eligible employees under the 2009 LTRP will be in addition to payments of base salary and cash bonus, if earned, made to these employees. In order to receive an
award under the 2009 LTRP, each eligible employee must satisfy the performance conditions established by the board of directors for him or her. If these conditions are satisfied, the
eligible employee will, subject to his or her continued employment as of each applicable payment date, receive the full amount of his 2009 LTRP bonus, payable as follows: (I) the
eligible employee will receive a fixed cash payment equal to 6.25% of his or her 2009 LTRP bonus once a year during eight years starting in 2010 (the "2009 Fixed Payment"); and
(II) on each date the company pays the Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a cash payment (the "2009 Variable Payment") equal to the product of (i)
6.25% of the applicable 2009 LTRP bonus and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the
denominator, equals the 2008 Stock Price, defined as $13.81, which was the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60
trading days of 2008. The "Applicable Year Stock Price" shall equal the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60
trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date.

(c) On June 25, 2010, the board of directors adopted the 2010 Long Term Retention Plan (the "2010 LTRP"). If earned, payments to eligible employees under the 2010 LTRP will be in
addition to payments of base salary and cash bonus, the latter if earned, made to these employees. In order to receive an award under the 2010 LTRP, each eligible employee must
satisfy the performance conditions established by the board of directors for him or her. If these conditions are satisfied, the eligible employee will, subject to his or her continued
employment as of each applicable payment date, receive the full amount of his 2010 LTRP bonus, payable as follows: (I) the eligible employee will receive a fixed cash payment
equal to 6.25% of his or her 2010 LTRP bonus once a year for a period of eight years starting in 2011 (the "2010 Annual Fixed Payment"); and (II) on each date we pay the Annual
Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a cash payment (the "2010 Variable Payment") equal to the product of (i) 6.25% of the applicable 2010 LTRP
bonus and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the 2009 Stock
Price, defined as $45.75, which was the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60 trading days of 2009. The "Applicable Year
Stock Price" shall equal the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60 trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment
date.

For the 2008 LTRP and the Variable Payment of the 2009 and 2010 LTRP, the U.S. GAAP compensation cost is recognized in accordance with the graded-vesting attribution method
and is accrued up to each payment day. For the Fixed Payment of the 2009 and 2010 LTRP, the compensation cost is recognized in a straight-line basis. The non-GAAP measures
were calculated with the cost for each period being accrued in the full fiscal year immediately preceding the payment date according to the same payment schedule in which 27%
and 22% of the cost of the 2008 LTRP plan vests during the three and nine-months periods ended September 30 2010 and 2009 respectively, and 12.5% of the cost of the 2009 and
2010 LTRP vests during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. The following tables show a reconciliation of this cost from the GAAP measures to
the non-GAAP measures.

Venezuelan foreign currency re-measurement effect

In the comparative period this amount relates to re-measurement of assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars in the Venezuelan statutory Financial Statements. Until September 30, 2009,
the Venezuelan subsidiaries have re-measured the assets and liabilities outstanding in U.S. dollar balances at the parallel exchange rate and translated them to the official exchange
rate. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2009, as a result of the changes in facts and circumstances that affect the Company's ability to convert currency for dividends remittances
using the official exchange rate in Venezuela, the Venezuelan subsidiaries assets, liabilities, income and expense accounts have been translated using the parallel exchange rate, for
that reason there is no longer a mismatch between the re-measurement exchange rate and the translation exchange rate. The following tables exclude the foreign currency re-
measurement effect generated in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 from applying different exchange rates in order to facilitate comparisons to present
quarter figures, and to highlight this exchange rate matter.
