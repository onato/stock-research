          NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


        To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
        present foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP
        financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure can be found in the tables below.

        This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
        prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
        companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
        principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
        our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure
        should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP
        financial measures.

        We provide this non-GAAP financial measure to enhance overall understanding of our current financial
        performance and its prospects for the future, and we understand that this measure provides useful information to
        both Management and investors. In particular, we believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to
        both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be
        indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

        The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
        2020 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2021, so as to calculate what our results would have
        been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
        allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
        currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
        currency inflation or devaluations.




                The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
                three-months period ended September 30, 2021:
