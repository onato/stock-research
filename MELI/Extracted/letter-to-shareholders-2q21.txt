pleased to announce that the team here at MercadoLibre team delivered
another quarter of strong growth in our commerce and fintech businesses in
Q2 2021, achieving record levels in both volume and revenues. This strong
performance builds on the solid first quarter we had this year. We believe that
our business is showing tremendous momentum despite immense volatility in
our key markets due to the frequent closing of physical retail across Latin
America. I am proud to see the consistent execution of our plans while
prioritizing innovation, speed of execution and user experience, all elements
that are at the core of our corporate DNA.”

  USD and 102.6% on an FX neutral basis.

  million in interest and financial expenses this quarter, a 45.8% increase year-over-year.

▪ We had foreign currency losses of $12.1 million, mainly attributable to our own stock
  acquisition in the Argentine market at a price that reflects the additional cost of accessing US

  government for buying US dollars at the official exchange rate.

▪ Net income before income tax expense was $138.9 million, a 55.5% increase from the $89.3
  million during the second quarter of 2020.

▪ Income tax expense was $70.7 million, mainly as a result of higher income tax expense in
  Argentina as a consequence of higher pre-tax gain in our Argentine segment in 2021 and
  higher income tax expense due to withholding tax on dividends from our Argentine subsidiary.

▪ Net income was $68.2 million, resulting in net income per share of $1.37.

       NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


    To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
    present foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP
    financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure can be found in the tables below.
    This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
    prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
    companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
    principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
    our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure
    should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP
    financial measures.
    We provide this non-GAAP financial measure to enhance overall understanding of our current financial
    performance and its prospects for the future, and we understand that this measure provides useful information to
    both Management and investors. In particular, we believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to
    both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be
    indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.
    The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
    2020 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2021, so as to calculate what our results would have
    been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
    allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
    currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
    currency inflation or devaluations.




          The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
          three-months period ended June 30, 2021:
