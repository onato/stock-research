    What you can’t miss

•    Our Commerce business continues to perform consistently, with resilient growth across our major markets even as traditional retail fully reopens. We
     reached $8.6 billion dollars in gross merchandise volume, with growth accelerating to 32% year-over-year on a FX-neutral basis.

•    We are particularly pleased with our performance in Brazil, where we have gained significant market share, and in Mexico, where our growth was
     driven primarily by an increase in unique buyers, highlighting the traction that we have achieved there.

•    Our Fintech business continues to show strong momentum with Total Payment Volume reaching $32.2 billion dollars, and off-platform TPV growing
     above 100% on a FX-neutral basis for the fourth consecutive quarter.

•    We surpassed 40 million unique active users in fintech for the first time, adding the most users on a quarterly basis in the last two years. All geographic
     segments contributed to this growth.

•    Mercado Crédito's portfolio reached almost $2.8 billion with growth slowing on the back of our decision to slow originations. The financial performance
     of our credit business remained solid, with annualized IMAL* spreads of 37% in Q3’22.

•    We achieved a new record in total revenues of almost $2.7 billion, with take rates up slightly on a sequential basis in Commerce, and down slightly in
     Fintech due to a greater mix of larger merchants in our TPV.

•    We achieved record quarterly EBIT of $296 million dollars, with the operating margin expanding to 11.0% in Q3’22, highlighting our commitment to
     delivering sustainable and profitable growth.
