  Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 5th, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE):
  MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com),
  Latin America’s leading e-commerce technology company, today
  reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.



Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented,
“Given the difficult circumstances the world is facing, we are optimistic about the
results we've delivered during the first quarter of 2020. Although less affected than
others, our business did register this impact, primarily during the first weeks of the
imposed lockdowns, with a rebound throughout April. We remain committed to doing
our part, by empowering our merchants to continue operating and securing deliveries
of goods needed by households. We feel Mercado Libre has the opportunity to emerge
from this situation stronger and with an even greater sense of purpose. We trust the
dedication and commitment being demonstrated by our entire organization will allow us
to continue executing our strategy with no significant interruptions, and in doing so
play our part in contributing to making things less difficult to our users during these
trying times. Finally, and most importantly, our hearts go out to those individuals and
families affected by COVID-19, and our gratitude and appreciation go out to all those
brave individuals who are on the front lines working through this unprecedented global
health crisis.”
    RECENT COVID-19 RELATED KEY TRENDS


▪ Government-imposed total or partial lockdowns instituted throughout Latin America in late
  March impacted geographic segments and business lines differently. Additionally, the
  magnitude of negative impact was greater in the initial weeks following government mandated
  lock downs, with gradual improvements as time elapsed.

▪ The marketplace KPI’s hit a low point during the week of the 18th to the 24th of March. Year-
  over-year growth for items sold during that week troughed at 3.3%, with Fx Neutral GMV
  declining by 1.4%. From then onwards, we have seen a strong rebound, with growth rates
  accelerating in April to 75.8% year-over-year in Items Sold and 72.6% Fx Neutral year-over-
  year in GMV for the full month.

▪ Initially, consumers seem to have pulled back on expenditures on non-essential items. This
  led to a mix shift in sales. Categories such as health, consumer packaged goods and toys and
  games showed strength, with volume growth in those categories exceeding 100% year-over-
  year on an FX neutral basis in some markets. Conversely, certain higher ticket, non-essential
  categories such as auto parts and consumer electronics saw marked declines in growth rates.

▪ Managed logistics network continued operating normally, guaranteeing timely deliveries for
  orders shipped through it. Warehouses remain with no significant disruptions, rapidly
  approaching having half of our shipments already running on our own logistics network, not
  only improving average cost per order and shipping times but also service levels.

▪ The fintech business also experienced an initial slowdown during the third week of March,
  followed by sequential weekly improvements through the last week of March and into April.
  Off marketplace TPV growth during the second half of March was 95.4% year-over-year on an
  FX Neutral basis, and TPN was 87.3% year-over-year. By April these growth rates had
  accelerated to 155.6% and 119.8% respectively. Deceleration in number and volume of
  payments processed was a consequence primarily of lower foot traffic in physical retail, which
  had a direct impact on lower mobile point of sale and QR total payment volume growth
  partially offset by the relative strength in Merchant Services.

▪ By the end of the quarter, the non performing loan ratios had not shown a deterioration due to
  the COVID-19 crisis.

▪ Nonetheless, to manage our exposure to merchant and consumer credits amidst a global
  pandemic, we slowed credit originations to both cohorts.

▪ In terms of liquidity and cash management for the fintech business, all relevant funding
  sources remained available, drawing on credit facilities to maximize liquidity at a local
  subsidiary level. The consolidated Balance Sheet currently holds approximately $2.3 billion
  dollars in cash, cash equivalents and liquid securities.
    FIRST QUARTER 2020 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS



▪ Unique active users grew 30.9% reaching 43.2 million.

▪ Total payment volume (“TPV”) through Mercado Pago reached $8.1 billion, a year-over-year

  reaching $4.7 billion in transactions and 217.3 million payments, a 146.2% year-over-year
  growth.

▪ On a consolidated basis MPOS TPV grew 103.3% on an FX neutral basis.

  leading to a 299.2% year-over-year growth on a FX neutral basis for the full first quarter
  2020. Our mobile wallet consumer base grew by 155.1% compared to the first quarter 2019,
  surpassing the 8 million unique payers mark. TPV from mobile wallet in Argentina, Brazil and
  Mexico continues to grow by triple digits year-over-year.

▪ Our asset management product, Mercado Fondo, is now available in Argentina, Brazil and
  Mexico. Mexico was launched during the quarter, leading Mercado Fondo with more than $
  350 million under management and more than 7.3 million users across Latin America.

▪ Our online off-platform payments solution, Merchant Services, had the lowest deceleration
  during the quarter growing on a consolidated basis 81.7% year-over-year on a FX Neutral
  basis.

▪ Gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) reached $3.4 billion, representing an increase of 10.6%
  in USD and 34.2% on an FX neutral basis.

▪ Items sold reached 105.7 million, growing 27.6% year-over-year.

▪ Live listings offered on MercadoLibre’s marketplace reached 267.4 million, a 29.8% year-
  over-year growth.

▪ Mobile gross merchandise volume grew 197.6% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis,
  reaching 69.8% of GMV.

▪ Items shipped through Mercado Envios reached 90.2 million, a 44.6% year-over-year

    FIRST QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS




▪ Net revenues for the first quarter were $652.1 million, a year-over-year increase of 37.6% in
  USD and 70.5% on an FX neutral basis.

▪ Commerce revenues increased 32.7% year-over-year in USD and 62.0% on an FX neutral
  basis, while Fintech revenues increased 45.2% year-over-year in USD and 83.4% on an FX
  neutral basis.

▪ Gross profit was $312.8 million with a margin of 48.0%, compared to 50.0% in the first
  quarter of 2019.

▪ Total operating expenses were $342.5 million, an increase of 51.0% year-over-year in USD.
  As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 52.5%, compared to 47.9% during
  the first quarter of 2019. The $34.7 million improvement in operating expenses quarter-over-
  quarter was mostly driven by a decrease of $60.2 million in marketing expenditure, partially
  offset by a deterioration in bad debt.

▪ Loss from operations was $29.7 million, compared to a loss of $68.9 million during the prior
  quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the loss from operations reached 4.6% improving 567
  bps sequentially.

▪ Interest income was $36.8 million, a 50.5% increase year-over-year, as a result of equity
  offering during March 2019, which generated more invested volume and interest gain, and a
  higher float in Argentina.

▪ The Company incurred $23.6 million in financial expenses this quarter, mainly attributable to
  secured financial loans and interest expenses from our trusts related to our factoring business
  in Argentina.

▪ Net loss before taxes was $16.7 million, up from a loss of $63.0 million during last quarter.

▪ Income tax expense was $4.4 million.

▪ Net loss was $21.1 million, resulting in basic net loss per share of $0.44.

       NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


    To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign
    exchange (“FX”) neutral measures.

    This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
    prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
    companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
    principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
    our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should
    only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial
    measures.

    Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be
    found in the tables included in this quarterly report.

    The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
    measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for
    the future. Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and
    investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core
    operating results and business outlook.

    The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
    2019 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2020, so as to calculate what our results would have
    been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
    allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
    currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
    currency inflation or devaluations.

          The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations
          for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020:
