What you can’t miss
• We achieved record levels of gross merchandise volume, payment volumes and credit portfolio size in the fourth quarter; sustaining growth traction despite
  the tough year-over-year comps.

• Our users continue to demonstrate increased loyalty and engagement in our platform, with growth in items per buyer in commerce and in payment
  transactions per user in fintech, both in quarterly and yearly comparisons, as we develop more products and categories that drive frequency.

• We introduced important additions to our fintech services in the fourth quarter, including the strong scale up of the credit card, launch of the cryptocurrency
  trading platform, new insurtech products, and the acquisition of Redelcom to expand our payment processing operations for SMBs in Chile.

• The Credit business continues to expand originations while sustaining improvements in the risk scoring model – the business remained profitable in the fourth
  quarter and non-performing loan rates improved sequentially.

• This quarter, quarterly revenues surpassed $2 billion for the first time in its history, growing 74% YoY on an FX-neutral basis.

• Overall profitability at the EBIT and Net Income levels continue improving compared to last year. EBIT margin in Q4 was lower than prior quarters in the year,
  as expected, mainly due to the higher expenses for the promotional shopping season and growth of first party sales, as well as the reduced financing revenues.

• We are closing 2021 with important achievements in terms of growth while also delivering consistent improvements at the EBIT margin level for the full year, in line
  with our long-term commitment toward growth with sustained operating leverage.

Marketplace platform transactions; commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional
fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; commissions that we charge from transactions carried out with Mercado Pago credit and debit cards; interest cash advances and fees from merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado
Credito solution; and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products and insurtech fees.
