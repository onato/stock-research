Reports
Fourth Quarter 2022

February 23rd, 2023
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, February 23rd, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq:
MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s leading e-commerce technology company,
today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31st, 2022.



         Net Revenues of $3.0 billion up 56.5% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis
                  Income from operations of $349 million, with a 11.6% margin
    $36.0 billion Total Payment Volume, up 80.0% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis
   $9.6 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 34.7% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis


                                            To our Shareholders
                The end of the fourth quarter of 2022 brought a highly successful year to a close. Over the last 12
months, we have processed more than $100bn in payments, booked over $10bn of net revenues, shipped more than
1bn items through Mercado Envios, and surpassed $1bn of Income from operations, all for the first time in our history.
These major milestones confirm a successful and transformational multi year period for MercadoLibre.

                 Over the last three years, we have built a GMV base that is 2.5x larger than in 2019 and continues to
grow, we have ramped-up a logistics network with world-class delivery speeds (GMV delivered within 48 hours rose
from an average of 44% in 2019 to almost 80% in 2022) and we have strengthened the other key pillars of our
Commerce value proposition: assortment, price and service. The much-increased scale gained through this three
year period solidifies our position as Latin America’s e-commerce leader. It also positions us well to continue to
capitalize on the growth opportunity of the offline to online shift in retailing across the region.

                  During the same three year period we have also grown our TPV more than 4x, and our Fintech
revenues nearly 5x, making our Fintech business a major contributor to our top and bottom line growth. At the same
time, we have launched a full suite of products and services that extends our original payments offering to cards,
credit, insurance and savings, amongst others. Although we still have more products to build, the launches of the
last 18 months give us - for the first time - the critical mass of services that would enable our users to have their
principal financial services relationship with Mercado Pago. Of our almost 44mn unique active Fintech users in
Q4’22, more than half already utilize the wallet to make payments. These users are a natural (and growing) audience
for us to cross-sell additional services and products in a unified and simple manner, and build towards achieving
principality. Our competitive advantages in distribution and credit underwriting should support these cross-selling
efforts.

                Our market share of SMB Financial Services distribution is still low, with plenty of upside. In Brazil,
we expect that our move “upmarket” to serve larger long tail merchants and the lower end of the SMB segment will
continue to drive growth and market share gains. Mexico and Chile are both at an early stage of development, and
we expect to be a protagonist in the expansion of SMB services in those markets.

                 As a consequence of the building blocks we have laid over this past period, we believe we are well-
positioned to continue to drive growth and profit expansion in our businesses in the coming years. Our results in the
fourth quarter provide a good example of how a combination of strong execution, increased scale, solid competitive
advantages and appropriate long-term thinking can yield high growth and market share gains alongside robust profit
increases.
                                                  Commerce

                A strong performance in the fourth quarter rounded-off a great year for our Commerce business.
Our FX-neutral GMV growth accelerated to 35% in Q4’22, with Brazil (22% FX-neutral GMV growth) and Mexico (28%
FX-neutral GMV growth) driving the acceleration. Our Black Friday campaign in Brazil significantly outperformed a
weak market and this was just one of the highlights in a year of major market share gains in several categories that
was consistent across most geographies. These gains have been achieved not with silver bullets, but with consistent
investment and execution around all aspects of our value proposition over an extended period.

               We delivered a record-breaking El Buen Fin campaign in Mexico, placing the country as our fastest
growing market in volume terms. This growth shows the traction we have achieved, with unique buyers growing
above 20% year-on-year in 2022. These metrics reflect our strong competitive positioning, which helped us to
extend our market leadership in Q4’22 in Mexico, and across most markets.

                Argentina has shown weaker volume trends, with sold items growth decelerating for a third
successive quarter, and falling into negative territory. Consumers’ budgets are facing headwinds from rising prices
but, despite short-term pressures, profitability is strong and we remain confident in our long-term competitive
position. Macroeconomic factors also continue to impact Chile, but we are pleased to see that our GMV growth has
improved on a sequential basis, and our volume growth is back into positive territory.

                  Mercado Envios sustained its delivery speed leadership across the region, helping us to achieve the
strong peak season GMV growth mentioned above. Mercado Envios also reached its highest ever level of fulfillment
penetration of 43% in Q4’22, surpassing the previous record reached in Q4’21. Brazil saw a sequential increase in
fulfillment, with penetration back to its peak level of 40%. Mexico and Chile reached new highs in fulfillment
penetration. Our logistics teams have done a good job of mitigating external cost pressures through efficiencies and
pricing, so even with the costs related to higher fulfillment penetration, our Q4’22 net shipping cost was broadly
stable as a percentage of GMV, with a notable improvement in Mexico.

                 Mercado Ads continued to grow at a rapid pace in 2022 in all key geographies, with revenue as a
percentage of GMV reaching 1.4% in Q4’22. This marks another consistent step in the business’ expansion, making
the Ads business more than 5x larger than it was three years ago. This year has also been an important year in
building-out our capabilities, supported by doubling the number of engineers allocated to the Ads business. This
year’s technology deployments included our own Ad Server, which enables the automatic insertion of display
advertising, targeting capabilities and an automated dashboard for real-time reporting for Display performance, as
well as enhancements to the bidding process and placement logic of product ads. We have also made important
progress in the development of our DSP (demand side platform), which we expect to launch in 2023 and will
significantly upgrade our capabilities. All of these improvements are aligned with our strategy to build a complete Ad
Tech platform in Latin America.
                                                      Fintech

                 Momentum in our Fintech business remains strong. Our unique active fintech users reached almost
44mn in Q4’22, rising 27% year-on-year, whilst TPV grew at 45% in US dollars and 80% on an FX-neutral basis. A
strong off-platform performance in Q4’22, with growth of 58% in US dollars and 121% on an FX-neutral basis, took
our quarterly off-platform TPV over $25bn for the first time. This is a big accomplishment, placing us on an
annualized run rate of over $100bn, but this is just the latest milestone on a path that has much further to run.

                  One of the main ambitions on that path is to achieve principality amongst the portion of our user
base where our distribution and underwriting capabilities enable us to offer a strong value proposition. One of the
keys to unlocking principality is being able to offer the products and services that satisfy our users’ day-to-day
needs. After 12 to 18 months of product development and deployment, we now have the tools in place to shift
Mercado Pago from being mainly a payments wallet to a full-service digital account for our users. In Q4’22, the
average number of products being used by our Digital Account customers continued to rise. We are already seeing
this fast growth translating to profitability in Argentina.

               In Brazil and Mexico, the Credit Card will have an important role to play in achieving the
aforementioned principality, given the product’s value to consumers for their day-to-day needs. Through the second
half of 2022, we have seen a significant improvement in the performance of our Credit Card business after the
slowdown of new card issuance in the first half. Our underwriting has improved, although the latest cohorts remain
small, so we have further to go before being comfortable to re-accelerate. That said, we are pleased with our
progress, and we expect to launch in Mexico in 2023.

                 Mercado Credito as a whole continued to deliver strong results in Q4’22 with a period-end portfolio
of $2.8bn and IMAL spread of 48%. This was the highest spread achieved in 2022, a function of adjustments to our
APRs, broadly flat originations (which means slower formation of new provisions than earlier in the year), a larger mix
of lower risk cohorts in all markets, and better asset quality. The steps that we took in mid-2022 to mitigate the risks
of a weaker lending environment - particularly in Brazil - have worked as intended and, as a result, our early <90-day
NPL improved sequentially to 10% in Q4’22 and was broadly stable year-on-year. Brazil made a notable contribution
to this improvement in both the Consumer and Credit Card books. Looking at the year as a whole, we are pleased to
have been able to strike a good balance between risk management, profitability and growth at Mercado Credito.
Nevertheless, we remain alert to the short-term headwinds that the business faces, and we will maintain a cautious
posture until we are confident that the cycle has turned.

                  Our POS business has played an important role in our achievement of surpassing $25bn in quarterly
off-platform TPV, with growth of 61% in US dollars and 78% on an FX-neutral basis in Q4’22. We have seen strong
and consistent growth trends in MPOS throughout the year in our four largest markets. Mexico and Chile have
performed particularly well (albeit from relatively low bases), and we see significant growth potential in these
markets, which are still at an early stage of development. Brazil has also performed well in 2022, with our move
“upmarket” to serve medium- and large-sized long tail merchants and the lower end of the SMB segment, making a
major contribution to TPV expansion and strong growth in TPV per device. This has put some pressure on the take
rate, but given that larger merchants transact much more frequently, revenue is highly accretive.

                 Our Online Payments business also delivered consistent levels of growth in 2022, and in the fourth
quarter, FX neutral TPV growth was stable in Brazil and accelerated in Mexico and Argentina. Within our Online
Payments business, the Big Company category showed the fastest rate of growth, highlighting our ability to serve
merchants of all sizes with our variety of services.
                                           Consolidated Results

                 A strong finish to the year took our full-year revenue past $10bn and our income from operations
past $1bn, both new records. We are particularly pleased to have been able to deliver an attractive combination of
growth and profitability throughout the year, alongside strong operational KPIs and market share gains, all whilst
sustaining a high level of investment in new products and technologies.

                 In Q4’22, we generated $3.0bn of net revenues, growing year-on-year at 56.5% on an FX-neutral
basis, and 41% in US dollars. Our Commerce business contributed almost $1.7bn to this figure, with 36% FX-neutral
growth, whilst our Fintech operations delivered over $1.3bn of net revenues, with 93% FX-neutral growth. Our
Commerce take rate rose by 20bps year-on-year, primarily due to a higher penetration of advertising. Our Fintech
take rate rose significantly year-on-year, supported by Mercado Credito’s revenue of $560mn, growing 88% year-on-
year, and repricing in the Acquiring business. On a sequential basis, the Fintech take rate declined slightly due to a
lower level of credit revenue relative to TPV, but there was a small increase in the take rate of the other revenue
streams within Fintech.

                  Our Q4’22 income from operations reached $349mn, rising from $24mn in Q4’21, with a margin of
11.6% over net revenues. Part of the negative impact on margins from fourth quarter seasonality in our Commerce
business was offset by our continuous improvement in how to manage the promotional season, and with more
efficiency in logistics and promotional spending. We also delivered higher margins in most geographies as a result
of a stronger-than-expected performance in Fintech, which was driven by significant profit growth in our Acquiring
business, record results from Mercado Credito, and a notable reduction of losses in our Wallet and Digital Account
operations. In other words, the quarter’s major improvement in profitability was driven by a combination of operating
leverage on continued top line growth, strong execution and a clear focus on cost efficiency across the business.

                   We generated $165mn of net income in Q4’22, including a $64mn net foreign currency loss and an
unusually high tax charge of $144mn. The principal driver of this high tax charge was the recognition of the deferred
tax liabilities of the FIDCs that fund our credit business. In 2022, our net income reached $482mn, rising from
$83mn in 2021, underlining our commitment to profitable growth. Cash flow from operations for the year reached
$2,940mn, and total cash and cash equivalents ended the year at $1,910mn, alongside an improvement in our
leverage ratios.


                                               Looking Ahead

                 After a year of successfully navigating macroeconomic instability across the region and delivering
on our promise of sustainable and sequential growth in profit dollars, we are confident in Mercado Libre’s growth
potential in the coming years. We will continue to develop competitive advantages through technology so that we
are best placed to capitalize on the growth opportunities in Commerce and Fintech across Latin America. Our
technology investment has more than doubled over the last two years, and this gives us more resources than ever to
pursue those growth opportunities.

               In the short-term, we are operating in a fast-changing competitive landscape in Brazil. Our teams
have, as always, been active in ensuring that Mercado Libre is positioned as a natural home for consumers and
merchants seeking commerce and fintech solutions for their daily needs.

For the long-term, we remain as optimistic as ever about the fundamentals of our business, and we are confident
that the best is yet to come.

                                 Non-GAAP Financial Measures


                To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, we present foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation
of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure can be found in the
tables below.

                This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used
by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting
rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts
associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial
measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measures.

                 We provide this non-GAAP financial measure to enhance overall understanding of our current
financial performance and its prospects for the future, and we understand that this measure provides useful
information to both Management and investors. In particular, we believe that FX neutral measures provide
useful information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact
that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

                 The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for
each month during 2021 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2022, so as to calculate what our
results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below
excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic
effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to
compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

                 The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the
operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022:
