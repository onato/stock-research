                      •       Outstanding operational KPIs: Unique Buyers grew at 21% YoY to almost 61mn. This is
                              the fastest growth since the Covid pandemic and was driven by all our initiatives aimed
                              at driving offline retail online. Fintech MAU* also grew strongly, up 35% YoY to 56mn.


Key Messages          •       Strong GMV trends: FX-neutral GMV growth in Q3’24 hit 34% YoY in Brazil and 27%
                              YoY in Mexico as our investments continue to unlock the potential of the shift of offline
                              to online commerce in Latin America. In Argentina, items sold growth accelerated to
Third Quarter 2024            16% as consumption trends improved.

                      •       Credit growing at pace: Mercado Pago’s credit portfolio reached $6bn in Q3’24. This
                              is an increase of 77% YoY, with growth in all products and geographies. The credit card
                              grew at the fastest rate of 172% YoY, with the portfolio reaching $2.3bn (which has led
                              to a negative mix effect on NIMAL*** spreads).

                      •       Acquiring continues to scale: Acquiring TPV growth remains solid in all markets, with
                              FX-neutral growth of 30% YoY in Brazil and 46% YoY in Mexico. In Argentina, Acquiring
                              TPV growth picked up in real terms (discounting inflation).

                      •       Investment leads to short-term margin pressure: We continue to invest across the
                              business as we capitalize on the long-term, structural growth opportunities offered in
                              Latin America. This led to strong revenue growth of 35% YoY, and approximately
                              7.4ppt of YoY margin pressure (on a comparable basis). See slide 19 for more detail.

 Changes in Mercado Pago TPV
In Q1’24, we updated the definition of TPV which excluded peer-to-peer transfers within Mercado Pago. This impacts Total and Fintech Services (previously “Digital Account”) TPV, but
Acquiring TPV is unchanged. We think the change creates a better metric for investors to track a business that has evolved from a payments wallet into a full fintech services platform.

To aid investors, the table below shows the recast TPV values for 2022 and 2023.
