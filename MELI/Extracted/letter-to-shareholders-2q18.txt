BUENOS AIRES, Argentina , Aug. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (
http://www.mercadolibre.com ), Latin America's leading e-commerce technology company, today reported financial results
for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 .

Pedro Arnt , Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc. , commented, “The outlook for our industry is as positive as ever,
and our investment thesis remains intact. The internet is rapidly becoming a driving force that is increasing the pace of
modernization in Latin America . This modernization presents us with the opportunity to turn a history of underdeveloped
infrastructure in the areas of retail and banking from a disadvantage into an advantage, as it allows for innovation to
flourish unencumbered by existing legacy players.”

Second Quarter 2018 Business Highlights

     Gross merchandise volume again surpassed $3 billion , reaching $3.1 billion , a 15.2% year-over-year increase in USD,
     and a 35.9% year-over-year increase on an FX neutral basis, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of growth.
     Items sold increased for the second consecutive quarter to 85.4 million, a 38.8% year-over-year increase, delivering
     solid growth.
     Unique buyers grew 16.0% year-over-year versus 28.0% in the first quarter. This declining growth rate is attributable
     primarily to the price increases from our major postal partner, and the May truckers strike that lasted ten days and had
     a negative impact on e-commerce in Brazil . This deceleration in unique buyers growth in Brazil was partially offset by
     unique buyer growth rates in Mexico , Colombia , Chile and Argentina , where growth rates in unique buyers exceeded
     20%.
     Live listings offered on Mercado Libre’s marketplace grew to 154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, a 56.4%
     year-over-year increase, surpassing for the first time ever the 150 million mark.
     We continue to transition to being a mobile first company, as mobile gross merchandize volume “GMV” penetration
     grew 28.1% year-over-year reaching 55.5% mobile penetration.
     Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos reached 52.8 million, a 58.1% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by
     increasing our free shipping options, strong marketing of our loyalty program and customer acquisition initiatives.
     Items shipped in Argentina , Mexico , Chile and Colombia were highlights of the quarter, growing 73%, 135%, 440%,
     and 166% respectively year-over-year.
     Total payment volume through MercadoPago reached $4.4 billion , a year-over-year increase of 40.4% in USD and
     66.3% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 64.1% year-over-year, totaling 85.5 million for the
     quarter.
     We continue to successfully execute off-platform payments efforts (both online and offline) though merchant services,
     mPos, and mobile wallet businesses. On a consolidated basis, off-platform total payment volume grew 96.7% year-
     over-year in USD and 142.4% on an FX neutral basis.
     Our mobile-point-of-sale business quickly becoming one of our fastest growing non-marketplace business units,
     representing 43.3% of total off-platform payment volume for the quarter.

Adoption of ASC 606

     Effective January 1, 2018 , the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers related to revenue
     recognition (“ASC 606”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has adopted ASC
     606 using the full retrospective transition method and has accordingly revised its consolidated financial statements for
     the year ended December 31, 2017 , and applicable interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2017 , as if
     ASC 606 had been effective for those periods. Because the Company did not offer free shipping in 2016, net revenue
     for that year does not need to be recast.
     As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company must present net revenue net of amounts paid in connection with the
     Company’s free shipping initiative rather than including these amounts in the cost of net sales, as previously recorded.
     For the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 the Company incurred $97 million of shipping subsidies that have
     been netted from revenues.
     As a result of adopting ASC 606, our net revenues for the periods indicated below have been recast as presented
     below. Our adoption of 606 does not affect our operating or net income/loss.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign
exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-GAAP measure.

This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-
GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have
limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in
conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the
tables included in this quarterly report.

The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides
investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we
believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign
currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2017 and
applying them to the corresponding months in 2018, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange
rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this
measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on
impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.
The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month
period ended June 30, 2018 :
