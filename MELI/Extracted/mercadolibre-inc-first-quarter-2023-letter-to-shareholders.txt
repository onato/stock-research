                                            To our Shareholders
                 MercadoLibre has had a good start to the year, with encouraging performance across the business.
Our Q1’23 results demonstrate once again our commitment to, and capacity to deliver, profit growth alongside rapid
revenue expansion. We set a new Q1 record of $340mn for income from operations, with the margin over revenue
expanding from 6.2% in Q1’22 to 11.2% in Q1’23. As the business continues to scale, we remain focused on
strengthening operational efficiency so that our long term growth - which remains our top priority - is sustainably
profitable. Our Q1’23 KPIs highlight that momentum is strong across geographies, and that we are executing well as
we pursue the long-term growth opportunities offered by Latin America’s commerce and financial services markets.



                                                   Commerce
                 We are particularly pleased with the performance of our Commerce business in Q1’23. Growth in
items sold accelerated to almost 16% year-on-year (from 11% in Q4’22), contributing to FX-neutral GMV growth of
43% year-on-year (vs. 35% in Q4’22). Our three largest geographic segments - Brazil, Mexico and Argentina - all
delivered faster growth in items sold and FX-neutral GMV when compared to the prior quarter.

                  Brazil’s momentum continued to strengthen from an already solid base, with FX-neutral GMV growth
accelerating to 28% year-on-year in Q1’23 from 22% in Q4’22. Growth was broad-based across most categories, and
the acceleration was driven primarily by higher growth of items sold. The number of successful sellers rose by 23%
year-on-year, well ahead of the MercadoLibre average. Strong execution and many quarters of consistent
investment across all aspects of our value proposition have positioned us well to continue capturing more market
share in Brazil, (at an accelerating pace during Q1’23). Logistics continues to play an important role in driving those
share gains, so we are pleased that fulfillment penetration in Brazil rose by almost 4ppts year-on-year to reach a new
high of 41%. This increase has been achieved with an improvement of the economics of our shipping operations in
Brazil, alongside maintaining our leadership in delivery times.

                  Mexico continues to be the segment with the highest growth in items sold, hitting 29% year-on-year
in Q1’23, broadly in-line with the country’s FX-neutral GMV growth of 28.5%. Based on available industry data, we
estimate that our market share continues to rise, and we also see our brand preference metrics improving, reaching
higher levels than at any point during 2022. This shows that we continue to execute well, building on the strong
momentum generated through 2022 and taking advantage of the structural growth opportunities offered by the
Mexican market. Logistics is one of our strongest competitive advantages in Mexico, where our fulfillment
penetration is most advanced and we continue to have the fastest delivery times in most major urban centers for
millions of items.
                   Argentina’s FX-neutral GMV growth hit 107% year-on-year, albeit with much of that growth driven by
inflation; that said, there was also a reversal of last year’s weakening trend in items sold growth, with a year-on-year
expansion of 3% in Q1’23 after a contraction of 1% in Q4’22. This reflects the strength of our brand and value
proposition despite an extremely challenging consumer environment. We have also seen improving trends in Chile -
the largest market in our Other segment - with FX-neutral GMV growth returning to positive territory as we begin to
lap particularly tough comparisons from 2022. Setting aside these 2021 driven distortions, we believe that we are
well-positioned for long-term growth in Chile, with the widest assortment and a strong logistics network established
that enables us to deliver faster than our principal competitors, both of which contribute to Chile having the highest
conversion rate across the region.

                  Growth in our first party (1P) business reached a turning point in Q1’23, with FX-neutral GMV growth
accelerating to 28% year-on-year from 8% in Q4’22. The adjustments made over the last few quarters aimed at
strengthening our execution in 1P, particularly in certain key categories, are helping to put the business on a solid
footing with higher gross margin, faster inventory turn and wider use of automatic pricing. That said, we have more
work to do to continue to evolve the business so that we achieve the operational and financial targets that we have
set for 1P - particularly in Brazil and Mexico - so we will continue to pursue a measured growth strategy while that
work is ongoing.

                 Our advertising business continues to grow rapidly across geographies, with revenue as a
percentage of GMV reaching 1.4% in Q1’23. This is up 30bps year-on-year on a much higher GMV base, which shows
that Ads revenue growth - which remained consistent with prior quarters at 62% year-on-year in US dollars -
continues to significantly outpace GMV growth. Deployment of technology remains a key driver of the business’
expansion, and we are pleased to have launched the first version of our Ads Console in a test phase in Q1’23. Over
time, this technology will help us to compete for marketing dollars that have historically been difficult for us to
access, and it will help us to strengthen areas of the business that are already most advanced. More information on
Mercado Ads’ products and tech stack is available in the video that accompanies our Q1’23 earnings materials.
                                                      Fintech
                  In our Fintech business, TPV grew at 96% on an FX-neutral basis (46% in US dollars), reaching
$37.0bn, of which $27.0bn came from off-platform volume. Off-platform TPV grew above 100% on an FX-neutral
basis for the sixth successive quarter, with Argentina, Brazil and Mexico all showing faster growth rates than Q4’22.

                Our Acquiring business is performing well across the region. In Brazil, our move upmarket - to serve
larger merchants, including SMBs - with POS devices is still showing good results, despite decelerating. Brazil
accounts for the majority of devices sold and in Q1’23, this number dropped below the 1mn mark as we focused on
larger merchants and device activations, rather than just device sales. As a result, TPV per device continues to grow
nicely, up 26% year-on-year in US dollars. In Mexico, Point continues to deliver triple-digit TPV growth as Mercado
Pago acts as one of the leaders in the digitalization of money in the country. In Chile, the performance of Redelcom,
a business that we acquired at the end of 2021, continues to surpass our expectations.

                Digital Account TPV - which includes Wallet payments, peer-to-peer transfers within the ecosystem
and transactions using Mercado Pago cards - grew at 164% on an FX-neutral basis, with Brazil and Mexico showing
strong double-digit growth rates, whilst Argentina’s growth was triple-digit and well ahead of inflation.

                  Following major product investments and launches in 2021 and 2022, in Q1’23 we took an
important step in the positioning of Mercado Pago as a full-service digital account with the launch of a marketing
campaign in Brazil that leverages the awareness of, and trust in, our commerce business to strengthen awareness
and consideration of our fintech business. In April, the campaign also launched in Mexico. As we highlighted in our
Q4’22 Shareholder Letter, we believe that we now have the critical mass of services necessary for users to be able
to have their principal financial services relationship with Mercado Pago. The objective of this long-term strategy is
to develop a deeper relationship with our 44mn quarterly unique active fintech users, a user base that continued to
grow at almost 25% year-on-year in Q1’23. For example, our Insurtech and Savingstech services are showing some
positive early signs (albeit still small scale) and if we succeed in our strategy, we expect that these products should
gain further traction.
                  Mercado Pago’s credit business delivered another solid performance in Q1’23. The portfolio of $3bn
grew marginally on a sequential basis as we maintained a cautious posture regarding originations, particularly in
Brazil. That said, demand remains robust and even with our cautious approach, we originated $2.7bn in the quarter.
Interest Margin After Losses (IMAL), which encompasses credit revenue and provisions for doubtful accounts,
reached 38.8% on an annualized basis, compared to 48.3% in Q4’22 and 24.7% in Q1’22. Limited growth in
originations (compared to Q4’22) and a portfolio whose risk profile remains skewed towards lower risk cohorts
contributed to the year-on-year improvement in IMAL; the sequential contraction in IMAL, from an exceptionally high
level in Q4’22, was due to some negative seasonality in the online merchant book, and the pick-up in growth of the
credit card. That said, our 1-90 day non-performing loan (NPL) ratio continued to fall, to 9.5%. Towards the end of the
first quarter, we started to slowly accelerate new credit card issuance in Brazil from a low base after several months
of improving performance. We are also pleased to have launched the credit card in Mexico in Q1’23, albeit with
limited levels of issuance so far.

                                           Consolidated Results

                 On the back of the solid operational performance detailed above, MercadoLibre delivered
encouraging financial results in Q1’23 with $3.0bn of revenue and income from operations of $340mn. Consolidated
revenue grew at 58.4% on an FX-neutral basis, and 35% in US dollars, with solid US dollar growth in Brazil (26% year-
on-year), Argentina (39% year-on-year) and Mexico (62% year-on-year). The slowdown in Fintech revenue growth
(64% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis) was a consequence of our credit business lapping into the prior year’s
sharp growth acceleration, coupled with the take rate from other Fintech revenue streams remaining broadly stable
year-on-year, compared to a large expansion in Q4’22 from an unusually low level a year earlier. This slowdown was
offset by the acceleration of Commerce revenue growth (to 54% on an FX-neutral basis) on the back of faster year-
on-year GMV growth and higher monetization.

                All of our geographic segments delivered major improvements in direct contribution, with Mexico
3.5x higher year-on-year, Brazil up 70% and Argentina rising 57% (all in US dollars). Consolidated income from
operations reached the prior mentioned $340mn, with a year-on-year margin expansion of 500bps. This gain was
due to operating leverage on strong revenue growth of 35% year-on-year in US dollars compared to cost of net
revenues and operating expenses both growing at 28%. A higher mix of advertising, improvements in net shipping
charges, and a slightly lower revenue contribution from 1P were positive drivers of margin, in addition to the dilution
of some cost of net revenues and G&A expenses. This record result was achieved whilst sustaining high levels of
investment in technology and innovation, with our product and technology development expenses rising 63% year-
on-year, deleveraging 200bps as a percentage of sales.

                Net income reached $201mn, a margin of 6.6% over revenue, with higher year-on-year net interest
income offset by larger FX losses, showing that net income growth was driven almost entirely by higher income from
operations. We also had a good start to the year with regards to cash generation, with positive cash flow from
operations of $859mn (versus cash consumption in Q1’22). This further demonstrates our strong operational
momentum, and also contributes to the strength of our balance sheet.
                                                Looking Ahead

                 After a good start to 2023, we remain focused on continuing to execute well through the rest of the
year. We are pleased to see how many of our businesses are contributing to our sustained margin expansion. The
business has good momentum as we look to the remainder of 2023, and further ahead. We continue to believe that
there are attractive growth opportunities in front of us, with many new products still to develop. The recent
announcement that we will hire an additional 1,700 engineers in 2023, on top of almost 14,000 already working at
MercadoLibre at the end of 2022, is testament to that. We remain committed to delivering on those growth
opportunities in a profitable manner in the long-term. We are as optimistic as ever that the best is yet to come.

 (**) As from January 1, 2022, we no longer disclose our total volume of payments on marketplace net of shipping and financing fees. Given the
 growth of our shipping and fintech businesses, management believes that including shipping and financing fees in the calculation of total volume
 of payments on marketplace results in a more accurate indicator of that performance on a go-forward basis. Consequently, total volume of
 payment on marketplace for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 has been recast to include shipping and financing fees.

                     Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance


                To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest
expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization
and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, interest margins after losses
(“IMAL”) and foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-
GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables
below.

                  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP
measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any
comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not
reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in
conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

                 We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its
prospects for the future.

Adjusted EBITDA

                 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to
eliminate the effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest
expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an
unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our
Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation
of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it
provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain
items.

                The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the
periods indicated (in millions):
Net debt

                  We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and
other financial liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding foreign government debt securities held in
guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have included this non-GAAP
financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios and set targets
to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash flows and income
statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other market
participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of repayment as a
means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used measures.

                   The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated (in
millions):




(1) Excludes foreign government debt securities held in guarantee and investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization
transactions.
(2) Excludes investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.



IMAL

                   IMAL is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the annualized ratio between total
credits revenues of the last quarter less provision for doubtful accounts for the last quarter and total loans
receivable as of the end of the quarter. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used
by our Management to monitor how effectively we are pricing the credit product relative to its risk. As such, it is
used internally as a measure to monitor performance, manage risk and set targets. Accordingly, we believe this
measure provides useful information to investors and others portraying how revenues and provision for
doubtful accounts interact with the portfolio size through the different quarters and showing how effectively we
are pricing risk, and as a simple measure of profitability.

                 The following table presents a reconciliation of IMAL for each of the periods indicated (in
millions, except percentages):
FX neutral

                 We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and
investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core
operating results and business outlook.

                   The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for
each month during 2022 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2023, so as to calculate what our
results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The comparative FX
neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2021
and applying them to the corresponding months in 2022. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX
effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation
effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or
devaluations.

                 The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the
operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023:
