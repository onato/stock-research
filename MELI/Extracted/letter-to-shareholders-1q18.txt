     Mobile GMV penetration grew 13.0% year-over-year to 54%, representing the first time the Company has surpassed
     50% growth in terms of representation of total GMV.
     Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos reached 52.5 million, a 92.4% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by

Adoption of ASC 606

     Effective January 1, 2018 , the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers related to revenue
     recognition (“ASC 606”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has adopted ASC
     606 using the full retrospective transition method and has accordingly revised its consolidated financial statements for
     the year ended December 31, 2017 , and applicable interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2017 , as if
     ASC 606 had been effective for those periods. Because the Company did not offer free shipping in 2016, net revenue
     for that year does not need to be recast.
     As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company must present net revenue net of amounts paid in connection with the
     Company’s free shipping initiative rather than including these amounts in the cost of net sales, as previously recorded.
     For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 the Company incurred $112.5 million of shipping subsidies that
     have been netted from revenues.
     As a result of adopting ASC 606, our net revenues for the periods indicated below have been recast as presented
     below. Our adoption of 606 does not affect our operating or net income/loss.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign
exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-GAAP measure.

This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-
GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have
limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in
conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the
tables included in this quarterly report.

The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides
investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we
believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign
currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2017 and
applying them to the corresponding months in 2018, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange
rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this
measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on
impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2018 :
