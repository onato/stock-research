 Fintech revenues are generated from payments fees. With respect to our Mercado Pago service, we generate payment fees attributable to: commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume
 processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off Marketplace platform transactions; commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado
 Pago platform for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; cash advances and fees from
 merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado Credito solution; and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products.
