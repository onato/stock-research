       NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


    To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign
    exchange (“FX”) neutral measures.

    This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
    prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
    companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
    principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
    our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should
    only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial
    measures.

    Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be
    found in the tables included in this quarterly report.

    The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
    measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for
    the future. Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and
    investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core
    operating results and business outlook.

    The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
    2018 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2019, so as to calculate what our results would have
    been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
    allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
    currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
    currency inflation or devaluations.

          The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for
          the three-month period ended December 31, 2019:
