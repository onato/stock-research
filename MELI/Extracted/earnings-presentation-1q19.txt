 Expanded and improved supermarket experience in Mexico with already more than 18.5k CPG SKU’s available on the site. Although early
  stage, we observe that basket size is also 20% higher on orders that have supermarket items

First Quarter 2019 Quarterly Highlights
US$2 Billion Capital Raise
 During the first quarter of 2019, we finalized a successful capital raise of US$2 billion dollars from both financial investors as well as a
  strategic investor, PayPal
 PayPal’s US$750 million dollar investment is a validation of the joint vision we share in terms of business and purpose to digitize the
  economy and leverage technology to generate financial inclusion by offering compelling financial solutions to those who are not served or
  currently underserved by traditional financial institutions.Such investment is a substantial amount that should jumpstart Mercado Pago grow
  its scale and scope alongside one of the leading global fintech companies in the world
 The trust that has been built over the years with PayPal and the history we have of informally exchanging best practices with them, gives us
  the confidence that we will be able to find areas that will generate powerful synergies with each other as we move into the second half of
  2019
 Our teams are diligently working on developing scalable commercial agreements that complements PayPal’s global merchant base, data,
  products, and technology with our local know-how and distribution capabilities to unlock incremental value to all our stakeholders
First Quarter 2019 Quarterly Highlights
Financial Results
 Gross billings reached US$548 million dollars, the 20th consecutive quarter of gross billings growth above 60% driven by improved
  monetization on our marketplaces and continued successful execution on our payments business (financing business and off-platform
  revenue streams through merchant services and MPOS)
 On an FX neutral basis our main countries also delivered solid performance from a gross billings perspective on an FX neutral basis:
  Mexico maintained momentum growing 113.5% YoY, Argentina accelerated to 108.2% and Brazil with solid performance with the 6th
  consecutive Q growth above 50% reaching 50.9% YoY
 Consolidated Net revenues on an FX neutral basis accelerated to 93% YoY reaching US$473.8 million dollars as we optimized shipping &
  loyalty program subsidies
 Gross profit remained stable versus last year, ascending to US$237 million, representing 50% of revenues during the quarter. Shipping
  carrier and operating costs explain most part the gross margin compression over last year
 Operating profit for the first quarter of 2019 ascended to US$10.1 million dollars an increase of US$11 million dollars versus last quarter
 As reported operating expenses ascended to US$226.9 million dollars or 47.9% of revenues versus 59.9% during the first quarter of 2018
 Main drivers of OPEX margin leverage this quarter were attributed to lower marketing operating margins (calculated as percentage of
  revenues) given increases in efficiencies on buyer protection payouts, lower loan loss provisions from our credit portfolio, as well as
  leverage in salaries & wages on sales and marketing, product development, and G&A
 We saw US$15.6 million dollars in financial expenses attributed for the most part to financial interest related to our convertible note due
  2028
 Interest income increased by 165.9% year on year to US$24.4 million dollars mainly attributable to higher float in Argentina and Brazil, as
  well as the proceeds from the convertible note issued in August 2018
 Our forex line was negative US$3.7 million, mainly due to the U.S. Dollar revaluation over our Argentine Peso net asset position in Argentina
 Net income increased to US$11.9 million dollars for the first quarter, resulting in a basic net income per share of 0.13 cents
