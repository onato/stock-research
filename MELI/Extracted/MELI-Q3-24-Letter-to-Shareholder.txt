                    Letter to Shareholders

͏MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; November 6th, 2024 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com),
 Latin America’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024.


        Net revenues & financial income of $5.3 billion, up 35% YoY and 103% FX-neutral
                  Income from operations of $557 million, with a 10.5% margin
                          Net income of $397 million, with a 7.5% margin
              $50.7 billion Total Payment Volume, up 34% YoY and 73% FX-neutral
            $12.9 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 14% YoY and 71% FX-neutral



    To our Shareholders

  We are pleased to report another quarter of growth in Q3'24. Momentum is strong across the business, with
  solid growth in unique buyers, Fintech monthly active users (MAU), GMV, the credit portfolio and acquiring
  TPV in all major geographies. We believe we are making excellent progress on our long-term strategic goals
  of increasing the penetration of online commerce in Latin America, becoming the principal financial services
  provider to users of Mercado Pago and scaling our acquiring business. Our competitive position is
  strengthening as retention improves across our businesses. This gives us great confidence as we invest to
  fully capitalize on the many growth opportunities that are ahead of us, knowing that our ecosystem is uniquely
  placed to capture those opportunities.


    Commerce

  We are excited about the prospect of driving offline retail online in Latin America, where ecommerce
  penetration lags the USA by almost a decade. We see a huge runway for growth. We executed well on this
  opportunity in Q3'24, with very strong FX-neutral GMV growth of 34% YoY in Brazil and 27% YoY in Mexico. In
  Argentina, items sold grew by an impressive 16% YoY as consumption trends continued to improve. Market
  share grew in all major geographies. Unique buyers across the region reached almost 61mn, rising 21% YoY.
  This is the second quarter in succession that unique buyer growth has accelerated to a new post-pandemic
  high. This performance reinforces our conviction in the investments we are making to capture the long-term,
  structural growth opportunities ahead of us.

  Offline to online is a secular trend, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum; it is fueled by innovation and investment
  to constantly improve the online buying experience. Initiatives in Q3'24 included the launch of installation
  appointments for autoparts, bulk purchase discounts in apparel, virtual try-on for makeup and dynamic pricing
  tools for sellers. Despite being the leading ecommerce platform with 25 years of history in the region, we still
  see plenty of scope to expand our user base given the population of more than 650mn in Latin America.

  In Q3’24 we split our loyalty scheme, MELI+, into two tiers called “MELI+ Essencial” and “MELI+ Total”. "Meli+
  Essencial", at just below $2 per month, provides users with a unique package of ecosystemic benefits
  including a lower threshold for free shipping, extra installments on purchases in Mercado Libre and cashback
  on purchases on and off Mercado Libre. The “MELI+ Total”, at roughly $5 per month, includes all these
  ecosystemic benefits plus access to content from Disney+ and Deezer, and discounts on other streaming
  services. With these changes, we are extending the reach of our loyalty scheme providing more value to
  users.




                                                                                                                 2
                                                                                             Q3’24 Results


Our logistics network is a powerful tool to drive offline retail online by providing a better user experience for
both buyers and sellers. Fulfillment leads to higher GMV growth because of faster delivery promises, higher
conversion and stronger buyer and seller NPS. This is a self-reinforcing process that repeats as we increase
fulfillment. This is the reason why we continue investing in expanding our logistics infrastructure to increase
the penetration of fulfillment in Brazil and to keep up with the strong pace of growth in our Commerce
operation in Mexico. As such, we opened five fulfillment centers in Brazil in Q3'24, plus one in Mexico.
Although new facilities can create short-term margin pressure, they are critical to our long-term growth, scale
and cost dilution.

1P GMV surpassed last year's peak quarter (Q4'23) due to growth of 62% YoY in Q3'24. Our strategy of
expanding our product assortment at competitive prices where there are gaps in our 3P selection is
succeeding. We introduced presale functionality for the iPhone 16 launch, for which we had a full assortment
and competitive prices. We also had exclusivity for the launch of the Motorola G85, an accessible smartphone
with a premium design. These examples show how 1P is turning MELI into a destination for categories in which
we have historically had less presence in. As we scale 1P, we continue to see improvements in its profitability.
As such, 1P did not act as a drag on the YoY evolution of our income from operations margin Q3'24.

Advertising is a strong profit driver for Mercado Libre, with significant potential for growth as the digital Retail
Media trend gathers steam and first-party data becomes increasingly important. We also see growth
opportunities as we build our presence in advertising formats beyond Product Ads, which currently accounts
for most of our revenue. Advertising revenue grew 37% YoY in Q3'24, well ahead of GMV, reaching a
penetration of 2.0% of GMV, up 30 bps YoY.

  Fintech Services
We have great momentum in Fintech Services as more users choose Mercado Pago as their financial services
partner. MAU rose 35% YoY to 56mn in Q3'24. Engagement is rising, with "power users" (those transacting in
nine out of the last twelve weeks) growing at a much faster rate, and transactions and products per MAU also
rising. The expansion of our credit offer, particularly the Mercado Pago credit card, and rising awareness of
our remunerated account are driving this performance, as well as NPS gains.

The credit card had another good quarter in Q3'24, with the portfolio of $2.3bn growing strongly by 172% YoY
and 28% QoQ. We are scaling the credit card at pace because our scoring models are increasingly accurate
and our older cohorts are showing a good path towards profitability (with solid NIMAL spreads), with some of
them already being profitable. In Q3’24 we invested $76mn in scaling our credit card portfolio. Despite short-
term margin pressure, these investments are strategically important because the credit card drives the
adoption of Mercado Pago as a principal account and brings positive ecosystemic behavior.

The total credit portfolio grew at its fastest pace since Q1'22, rising 77% YoY to $6.0bn. Growth was strong
across products and geographies. The consumer book grew 37% YoY, helped by successfully extending
larger, longer duration loans to lower risk users in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The portfolio in Argentina
reached record levels and delivered solid profitability. We also surpassed the milestone of $1bn in merchant
loans across the region for the first time. Our consumer and merchant loans are a solid source of profitability
that more than offset the investments in our credit card.

The NIMAL spread of 24% fell 13ppts YoY, despite solid asset quality indicators with broadly stable roll rates
and the 15-90 day NPL of 7.8%. There were three reasons behind the reduction in NIMAL: the ramp up of the
credit card, the move upmarket in consumer and merchant credit, and the overall acceleration of our credit
originations in the quarter.

As we scale the credit card, its share in the total portfolio rose from 25% in Q3'23 to 39% in Q3'24. This
created a negative mix effect on NIMAL, because the credit card is a structurally lower spread product. The
second reason for the NIMAL decline was our strategic decision to continue moving upmarket with our credit
offering to lower risk users with lower spreads. This is incremental to portfolio dollars and has a positive
impact on NPS. Finally, we accelerated our origination across products in this quarter and, given that we
provision our expected losses up front, this resulted in higher bad debt in this quarter.

                                                                                                                 2
                                                                                            Q3’24 Results


Trends in fintech services more broadly are encouraging. Assets under management (AUM) had another
outstanding quarter, growing 93% YoY to $8.0bn. A large part of this is our remunerated account, which is
core to our value proposition as an entry point for wider engagement with Mercado Pago. Marketing
campaigns in Brazil and Mexico have led to a positive cycle of greater awareness, more users and higher
balances, all of which drive higher NPS. This, in turn, brings more users to our platform. We have seen this
work fantastically well in Argentina in recent years and more recently in Mexico, where funds invested in our
remunerated account increased 345% YoY. Insurtech is scaling well (revenues growing 36% YoY), with great
cross-selling around the ecosystem. For example, we launched a credit card insurance product in Q3'24 that
helps to accelerate the payback on the investment we are making in the credit card.

  Acquiring

Acquiring performed well in Q3'24 as we scale the business across the region. Acquiring TPV grew 30% YoY
in Brazil on an FX-neutral basis, with the POS business accelerating. We see plenty of growth potential in
Brazil, our largest acquiring market. A differentiated offer is key to fully capitalizing on this opportunity. We
launched software for merchants that use our POS devices in Q3’24 as a new front in this strategy. Initially, the
package enables merchants to create a product catalog, issue tax receipts and manage inventory. Over time,
we intend to layer on additional capabilities. The software is fully integrated with our ecosystem, so merchants
that sell on our marketplace can automatically download their product catalog to their Mercado Pago POS. We
also continue to cross-sell our fintech services, including credit, as another important differentiator and a
source of monetization.

In Argentina, acquiring TPV growth picked up in real terms (discounting inflation). This shows the strength of
the Mercado Pago brand, its role as a disruptive force in payments in Argentina and the improvement in wider
consumption trends. Acquiring TPV growth was solid in Mexico at 46% YoY (FX-neutral) with in-store
payments growing at more than 100% YoY. We have a huge opportunity in Mexico to lead the transition to
digital payments.

  Consolidated Financial Results

Net revenue and financial income reached $5,312mn in Q3'24, growing 35% YoY despite FX headwinds in all
three major geographies. The shipping reporting updates outlined in our Q1'24 Shareholder Letter contributed
13ppts ($513mn) to growth. Net revenue grew strongly in Brazil and Mexico, with both delivering FX-neutral
growth of 60% YoY. In Argentina, FX-neutral revenue grew 245% YoY, ahead of inflation and at a slightly
faster pace of real growth when compared to Q2'24. Both Commerce and Fintech revenue streams are
growing well, up 48% YoY (of which 24ppts relates to shipping reporting updates) and 21% YoY respectively,
despite FX headwinds.

Q3'24 income from operations reached $557mn, with a margin of 10.5% and a reduction of 9.5ppts YoY on a
reported basis. Approximately 2ppts of the YoY margin decline relates to the dilutive impact of the shipping
reporting updates outlined in Q1'24, and the impact of lower interest rates in Argentina following the
reclassification of Mercado Pago interest income and expense above EBIT (also in Q1'24). Excluding these two
effects, the EBIT margin contracted by 7.4ppts on a comparable basis.

Most of this 7.4ppts margin compression is due to strategic investment decisions that we made in the quarter,
which included:

    1. The investment in our credit business, which increases our upfront provisions and generates the
       largest single contributor (3.4ppts) to the YoY margin decline. As we explained before, we accelerated
       origination across all of our credit products (portfolio +77% YoY) and there was also a shift in the credit
       mix towards the credit card, which increased its share in the credit portfolio from 25% in Q3'23 to 39%
       in Q3'24.
    2. The investment in shipping, whose effect on margins is partially diluted by higher GMV and intense
       work to improve productivity. The overall cost impact on our consolidated income from operations
       margin from investments in logistics in Q3'24 was 0.8ppts YoY (as per the gross margin bridge in our
       earnings presentation).

                                                                                                               3

In addition to these effects, the accruals for variable compensation under the Long Term Retention Plan (LTRP)
increased 0.7ppts as a result of a larger share price increase in Q3'24 vs. Q3'23. G&A expenses rose 1.1ppts
YoY, of which 0.8ppts were due to a non recurring expense that relates to certain customer refunds for prior
periods. The remaining margin pressures come from business-as-usual cost volatility.

The 7.4 ppts margin compression described above, includes the net impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian
Real and the Mexican Peso during Q3´24

As we mentioned in previous quarters, the Net Income result adjusts for the FX distortions we have seen in
Argentina during 2023. In Q3'24 Net income rose 11% YoY to $397mn resulting in a Net Income margin of
7.5%. Lower EBIT was partially offset by a significant reduction in FX losses related to Argentina and lower
income taxes. As a consequence, even though the EBIT margin contracted by 7.4ppts compared to last year,
Net Income Margin only compressed by 1.1ppt as described in the chart below:

During Q3'24 we consumed $203mn of adjusted free cash flow mostly explained by the accelerated growth of
the credit portfolio. Year to date, we have generated more than $635mn of adjusted free cash flow. Our robust
financial flexibility, conservative capital structure and positive long-term fundamentals, led to Fitch upgrading its
credit rating on Mercado Libre to Investment Grade in October (BBB-).



   Looking Ahead

  Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance


To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and
other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments as non-
GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measures can be found in the tables below.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the
most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure
provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the
future.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the
effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense
and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an
unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our
Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation
of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it
provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain
items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial
liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities
restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have
included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current
leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance
sheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to
investors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its
capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used
measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

FX neutral

We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by
excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results
and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have
been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
three-month periods ended September 30, 2024:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

Adjusted free cash flow

Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash
equivalents and investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions
and equity securities held at cost, investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in
loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities related to
our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital of the Fintech activities. We
consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to
management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that
can be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the
utility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the
total increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe
it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated
statements of cash flows.

Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net
proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and
corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not
considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider
Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides
useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and
activities from the adjusted free cash flow.
