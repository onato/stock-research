 ² Income from operations includes $351mn of one-off expenses, which are detailed in the Q4'23 Shareholder Letter                                                MercadoLibre, Inc. I 3
                      •   Q4’23 was another quarter of strong growth & profitability. Revenue of $4,261mn
                          grew at 42% YoY, its fastest pace since Q3’22. Income from operations for Q4’23
                          was $240mn and was negatively impacted by one-off expenses** of $351mn
                          associated with contingent tax liabilities mostly related to previous periods.
Key Messages              Excluding one-off expenses related to previous quarters (but including all expenses
                          incurred in Q4’23), our 5.6% income from operations margin would have been
Fourth Quarter 2023       13.4%, a 270bps YoY gain. This is consistent with our ambition of gradual margin
                          expansion whilst continuing to invest in growth.

                      •   Results in Commerce were solid. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) reached
                          $13.5bn whilst growth in items sold accelerated to 29% YoY, the highest since
                          Q2’21, driven by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Our first-party business performed
                          well, with FXN-neutral GMV growth of 85% YoY in Q4’23.

                      •   In Q4’23, we delivered almost 122mn packages on the same or next day, a 21%
                          YoY increase. This was helped by the expansion of our fulfillment network, which
                          carried almost 50% of shipments in Q4’23, a new record.

                      •   Fintech KPIs also showed strong trends. Total Payment Volume reached $56.5bn
                          and within this, Acquiring TPV of $34.7bn grew at 104% YoY on an FX-neutral basis.
                          Off-platform TPV growth accelerated sequentially in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico,
                          while Chile (within our Other segment) continued to grow at strong triple-digit rates.

                      •   Mercado Pago’s credit portfolio reached almost $3.8bn in Q4’23, up 33% YoY.
                          Our Credit Card and Consumer books were the main drivers of growth. The
                          annualized NIMAL* spread rose YoY and QoQ, to 39.8%, which reflects our ability to
                          accurately price for risk and cautious risk management.


                          *NIMAL refers to net interest margin after losses, which is credit revenues (APRs and late fees) net of provisions for doubtful
                          accounts and funding costs. **For more detail on one-off expenses, see the Q4’23 Shareholder Letter.

  Total NPLs pierced the 30% rate for the first time in over a year,    Our provision in Q4’23 was equivalent to 7.5% of the                      Our conservative provisioning policy at inception and
  landing at 29.5%. In line with our prudent and conservative           portfolio. The decrease in total past dues in dollar terms                throughout the life of the loan ensures that we establish
  criteria, we include all renegotiations as part of our past dues.     was due to continued prioritization of asset quality, and                 and retain high levels of coverage.
                                                                        organic write off of previous cohorts.
  Our 15-90-day NPL edged slightly higher quarter-on quarter,
  driven by product mix, specifically Credit Card Brazil. Overall,
  and in line with seasonality, Q4 showed improved roll rate

  Our >90-day NPL continue to decrease, extending the cleansing
  of cohorts that commenced in 2022. We observe an expected
  increase in the medium term NPLs (91-210 dpd) as Q3’s larger
  originations age accordingly.
