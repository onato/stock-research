MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; October 29, 2025 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s
leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.


               Net revenues & financial income of $7,409 million, up 39% YoY and 49% FX-neutral
                              Income from operations of $724 million, with a 9.8% margin
                                          Net income of $421 million, with a 5.7% margin

                    Gross Merchandise Volume of $16.5 billion, up 28% YoY and 35% FX-neutral


To our Shareholders

We are pleased to report another strong quarter, demonstrating that our investments are delivering results across our ecosystem.
From widening access to credit and payments to strengthening our marketplace value proposition and reducing the frictions of
shopping online, our investments underpin the rapid growth of our key operating metrics. Our net revenue and financial income
grew 39% YoY in Q3’25 – the 27th consecutive quarter of growth above 30% YoY. During this seven-year period, market share and
NPS data show that we have significantly strengthened our competitive position across our businesses, while margins and cash
flow have improved markedly. This shows the power of scale and our ability to balance growth, investment and profitability over
multiple years. We see ourselves as exceptionally well-positioned to accelerate financial inclusion and ecommerce penetration
across Latin America, and are committed to investing to achieve this.



Commerce

We continue to make strong progress in leading the shift of offline retail to ecommerce in our region. Ecommerce penetration has
the potential to double in the coming years, which implies the ecommerce market more than doubling. Our ambition is always to
grow ahead of the market. Offering more free shipping is a key pillar of our strategy to capture this long-term growth opportunity.
The recent reduction in the free shipping threshold in Brazil from R$79 to R$19 is already driving strong results, consistent with
previous threshold reductions. Unique buyers in Brazil grew 29% YoY in Q3'25 – the fastest pace since Q1'21 and the largest
quarterly addition of unique buyers ever, surpassing even the pandemic peak. Sold items growth in Brazil accelerated to 42% YoY
and FX-neutral GMV also accelerated, rising 34% YoY. Market share gains accelerated and our NPS reached its highest level ever.

We are also seeing solid momentum on the supply side of our marketplace in Brazil. The number of merchants making sales in the
R$19–79 range grew at a double-digit YoY pace in Q3’25, while new listings in that range grew 3x YoY. These trends make our
marketplace more dynamic by broadening buyer choice and expanding opportunities for sellers. This explains why the number of
visits accelerated substantially, conversion reached an all-time high and retention hit record levels for new and existing customers.
Put simply, the lower free shipping threshold is attracting more buyers and enabling sellers to turn that traffic into higher sales. This,
in turn, creates a powerful flywheel of supply and demand.

The strength of our logistics network enabled us to absorb a 28% QoQ increase in shipments in Brazil without any negative impact
on service levels or speed. We are seeing good progress in the slow layer of our logistics network, which underpins free shipping
below R$79. The speed of those deliveries improved markedly through the quarter, making slow/free delivery options more
attractive. This has further reduced shipping revenue but, more importantly, has lifted conversion to record highs. Unit shipping
costs in Brazil fell 8% QoQ in local currency as our slow volumes increase scale and leverage unused capacity across our network.
This is an important milestone in a gradual journey to reduce unit shipping costs across the business.

Mexico delivered another outstanding quarter in Q3’25 as sold items growth accelerated to 42% YoY and FX-neutral GMV was up
34%. This growth reflects the broad strength of our value proposition, with on-time deliveries and free shipping penetration

reaching record highs, while 1P and CBT sustained their strong momentum. Fulfillment penetration also reached a new high, and the
resulting scale – together with ongoing productivity and efficiency initiatives – enabled us to achieve our lowest-ever unit shipping
cost in fulfillment in Mexico, down more than 12% YoY in local currency

In Argentina, we have added nearly 1mn new buyers per quarter so far this year – more than in any previous quarter in our history.
This reflects the strength of our value proposition compared to physical retail, which still represents approximately 85% of the total
retail market. The share of same- and next-day deliveries increased nearly 7ppts YoY as fulfillment penetration reached a new
record, even before our new Buenos Aires fulfillment center came online. We added drop-shipping from China to our CBT platform
and although the business remains small, we see potential to complement our US assortment with lower ASP categories, such as
fashion, toys and baby. Growth in Argentina remained resilient in Q3'25 despite a challenging macro backdrop, with sold items up
34% YoY and FX-neutral GMV up 44%.

Our marketing investments focus on expanding our social platforms and presence, positioning Mercado Libre as the destination for
the best prices, deals and assortment, and strengthening our brand. Latin Americans spend over three hours per day on social
media – well above the global average of two hours and twenty minutes. This is why we have intensified investment in social
commerce, with affiliate participants up 4x YoY in Q3'25. At the same time, our content creators produced tens of thousands of
videos driving traffic to our site for specific campaigns. Together, these programs put us at the center of younger users’ attention
and strengthen our position in categories such as apparel and beauty. Our branding campaigns also contributed to record brand
preference scores across Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile.

Mercado Ads is becoming a comprehensive digital media platform that goes beyond retail media by leveraging our first-party data
as a competitive advantage. Brands have responded positively to the expansion of our off-ecosystem inventory announced in
Q2'25, which enables campaigns to achieve high frequency and low CPMs. This complements on-ecosystem campaigns, where
users have higher intent (leading to higher CPMs). We are also adding new premium advertising inventory through partnerships with
Roku and HBO. Display & Video revenue is growing close to triple-digits, helping drive an acceleration of FX-neutral Ads revenue
growth to 63% YoY in Q3'25 (56% in USD).


Loyalty

We continue to strengthen MELI+ as its user base expands. In October, we announced that MELI+ subscribers in Brazil will be
eligible for fast shipping on marketplace purchases from R$19 (versus slow shipping for non-MELI+ buyers in the R$19-79 range).
This reintroduces a differentiated shipping benefit for MELI+ users in Brazil following the expansion of free shipping below R$79 to
all users in June. We launched the MELI+ Mega “super bundle” that includes Disney+, Netflix, HBO Max, Apple TV+, and our
ecosystem benefits, all managed in a single subscription. This shows the strength of MELI+ as a distribution channel for our
partners, and its compelling benefits for users. We also signed partnerships with McDonald’s, Petrobras, and 99 in Brazil to offer
MELI+ users co-funded cashback in Meli Dólar when paying with their Mercado Pago credit card. We think we are uniquely
positioned to offer the most compelling benefits package in LatAm, which will drive engagement with the Mercado Libre and
Mercado Pago platforms.



Fintech Services

Our goal in Fintech Services is to become the largest digital bank in Latin America by having the best value proposition. We made
further progress on both fronts in Q3'25 with MAUs up 29% YoY to 72mn and NPS reaching record highs – again – in Brazil. Our
internal data shows we now have the highest NPS among fintechs in Brazil, and we have maintained NPS leadership among
fintechs in Mexico.

The next step toward our goal is to continue driving principality. Principal relationships bring clear benefits: higher retention, lower
delinquency and broader cross-sell. NPS among principal users in Brazil is double-digit percentage points higher than our overall
NPS, which itself ranks among the market's highest. This gives us confidence that we have the right product and experience to
generate engagement and build principality. In Q3'25, the share of principal users rose 11ppts YoY in Brazil and 2ppts in Mexico.

                                                                                                                  Q3’25 Results



The Mercado Pago credit card is one of the key drivers of rising principality and strong NPS, and its compelling value proposition is
translating into higher usage. In Brazil, Mercado Pago’s share of wallet among low risk users has been rising consistently. More than
50% of credit card TPV in Brazil is transacted off-platform, showing how the card is used broadly beyond our ecosystem, not just as
a ‘MELI store card’. On-platform trends are also positive, with our credit card now consistently the #1 choice for installment
transactions in Brazil, surpassing all third-party cards. Offering extra installments has supported this, reflecting the power of our
ecosystem synergies.

We aim to replicate this dynamic in Argentina, where we launched our credit card in August. Engagement with Mercado Pago is
high due to widespread and frequent use of our QR payments network and our longstanding commitment to remunerating funds
held in our account. This solid foundation for the credit card is another demonstration of the strength of the ecosystem. The card
will enable users to further consolidate their finances with Mercado Pago and will strengthen our efforts to increase financial
inclusion in Argentina, where six out of ten adults do not have a credit card.

The total number of users in our credit portfolio surpassed 27mn in Q3’25. User growth was a key contributor to the portfolio’s
expansion, which rose 83% YoY to $11.0bn in Q3’25. The increasing accuracy of our underwriting models alongside improvement in
our asset quality metrics underpins our confidence to grow at a rapid pace. NIMAL compressed sequentially by 2ppts to 21.0% in
Q3'25, partly due to higher funding costs in Argentina; excluding Argentina, the compression would have been less than 1ppt. The
15-90 day NPL remained stable at 6.8%. Put simply, we are growing rapidly without compromising the quality of our portfolio. We
are able to do this because of our huge marketplace audience and the increasing accuracy of our models.

In Q3’25, we issued a record number of credit cards in Brazil as first payment defaults reached another record low. This metric also
improved YoY in Mexico. Our credit card cohorts continue to show consistent progress towards breakeven, profitability and
payback. Approximately half of the Brazil credit card portfolio is now profitable.



Acquiring

Our Acquiring business leverages the payments infrastructure we have built over more than two decades, originally for our
marketplace and then for merchants outside our ecosystem. Our market share is rising across all our markets, and has done so
consistently for several years. This is the result of the quality of our product and our wider value proposition, which includes credits,
banking services and, increasingly, software solutions. This helps us to increase retention and promote financial inclusion. For
example, our recent Brazil Impact Report showed that two out of three entrepreneurs in our ecosystem made their first financial
investment via Mercado Pago and 60% received their first ever credit from us. This strong foundation enabled us to grow FX-neutral
Acquiring TPV at 28% YoY in Q3'25 in Brazil, even with intense competition, as growth rates picked up sequentially in In-store and
Online Payments, and remained solid in QR.

In Mexico, our Acquiring business is also a key pillar of our efforts to digitalize cash. It enables merchants to accept payments with
the debit and credit cards issued by Mercado Pago (as well as other cards), increasing the usefulness of those cards. We surpassed
1mn active POS devices in Mexico in Q3'25 and continue to grow rapidly – a testament to strong demand, as well as the quality of
our product. Merchants using these devices can also access credit lines, providing another lever to promote financial inclusion in
Mexico. This structural growth opportunity helped us maintain strong momentum in Q3'25, with Mexico's FX-neutral Acquiring TPV
up 53% YoY, supported by much higher growth in the In-store segment.

Near-term trends in Argentina are mixed. FX-neutral Acquiring TPV is growing at a solid pace – 70% YoY in Q3'25 – despite macro
headwinds, but growth has slowed. This is driven by our In-store and QR segments, which have been impacted by near-term
weakness in consumption. Online Payments remains resilient as we attract new customers and ramp up new features, such as our
recurring payments product. We continue to believe there many long-term growth opportunities in Argentina.

Consolidated Financial Results

Net revenue and financial income grew 39% in Q3’25 to $7.4bn. Growth accelerated sequentially, despite a major increase in free
shipping and lower seller shipping charges, which reduced shipping revenue. FX-neutral growth decelerated modestly to 49% YoY
due to lower inflation in Argentina; growth in Brazil (35% YoY) and Mexico (42% YoY) remained strong, as we continued executing
on the structural growth opportunities we are pursuing in both countries.

Income from operations grew 30% YoY to $724mn in Q3’25. We made strategic investments that increased cost of revenue, sales &
marketing and provisions for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue. These include lowering our free shipping threshold in
Brazil, ramping-up 1P, investing in social commerce and expanding our credits business. In parallel, their contribution to revenue
and a combination of scale, efficiency and tight cost management allowed us to significantly dilute product development and G&A
expenses. The net effect was a modest YoY decline in our income from operations margin – a reasonable trade-off for investments
that expand our addressable markets, seed future growth, strengthen our competitive position and drive long-term scale.

Direct Contribution (DC) margin in Brazil declined YoY for the reasons discussed above. However, strong top line growth in Brazil
also contributed significantly to the dilution of product development and G&A expenses, much of which is recorded between DC
and income from operations. Short-term macro headwinds in Argentina resulted in lower growth on the marketplace and increased
funding costs in our acquiring and credit businesses. This led to a 4-5ppt compression of DC margin YoY and QoQ.

Net income of $421mn rose 6% YoY, growing at a slower pace than income from operations due to larger FX losses and a higher
tax rate YoY. The depreciation of the Argentine Peso against the US Dollar has a negative translation impact on our P&L, and
generates FX losses. This means that revaluations of monetary assets and liabilities nominated in local currency are recorded in our
P&L, which is not the case for other countries, due to Argentina being considered hyperinflationary under US GAAP. Furthermore,
this increases our tax rate under US GAAP because these FX losses are not deductible under local accounting rules.

We continue to generate strong cash flow, even with an intense pace of investment and the growth of our credit portfolio. Adjusted
free cash flow reached $206mn in Q3’25 after capex of $357mn and investment of $1,730mn in the growth of the credit portfolio
(partially offset by $485mn of third-party funding).


Looking ahead

We believe we are still in the early stages of realizing our full potential, with ecommerce penetration of just mid-teens in Latin
America, and single-digit market shares – in some cases, low-single digits – in many of our fintech businesses and advertising. This
conviction drives our approach to investments aimed at continuing to improve our value proposition for individuals and merchants
in commerce and fintech. While these investments put short term pressure on our margins, other investments, such as the credit
card in Brazil, begin to mature and their margin pressure eases. The balance between new and maturing investments will vary over
time, but the common theme across all of them is their long-term nature, and our conviction that they will drive sustainable
engagement, growth and scale. We are confident in our ability to execute on these growth opportunities and we remain committed
to doing so in a disciplined manner. This ensures that the best is yet to come.

(1) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts. Growth calculations based on this table may not total due to rounding. As of December 31, 2024, we no longer disclose the key
performance indicator "Number of items shipped". Management believes that "Number of items shipped", as a complementary disclosure to "items sold", no longer provides useful
information to investors to better understand our business. Following years of investment, our logistics network now ships 95% of items sold. As such, the two performance metrics,
"Number of items sold" and "Number of items shipped", have converged so we no longer see a benefit for investors in disclosing both.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency
losses, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets as non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be
found in the tables below.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP
measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that
they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These
non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measures.

We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an
overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of depreciation
and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency
losses, net and income tax expense. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to
evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we
believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in
the same manner as our Management. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as
it removes the effect of certain items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial liabilities and current and
non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents restricted due to
management restriction policies) and digital assets, short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and
foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.
We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios
and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash flows and income
statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other market participants in showing
the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our
leverage based on widely-used measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

FX neutral

We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign
currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2024 and applying
them to the corresponding months in 2025, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained
stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not
include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price
adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2025:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets

Adjusted free cash flow

Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and
investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at cost,
investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on
loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital
of the Fintech activities. From the second quarter of 2025 onwards, we have also included increase (decrease) in cash and cash
equivalents and investments restricted due to management restriction policies and digital assets as an adjustment in the calculation
of our adjusted free cash flow. We consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful
information to management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that can be
used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the utility of adjusted free cash
flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the total increase or decrease in our available cash,
investments and digital assets balance for the period. Therefore, we believe it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow
measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets

Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets (from the second quarter of 2025 onwards, our available
funds include digital asset holdings) represents adjusted free cash flow less net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and
other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing
and/or financing activities not considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We
consider Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets to be a measure of liquidity availability that
provides useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and activities
from the adjusted free cash flow.
