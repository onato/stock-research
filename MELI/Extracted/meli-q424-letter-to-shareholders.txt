                    Letter to Shareholders

     MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; February 20th, 2025 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://
www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results
for the fourth-quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.


        Net revenues & financial income of $6.1 billion, up 37% YoY and 96% FX-neutral
                    Income from operations of $820 million, with a 13.5% margin
                            Net income of $639 million, with a 10.5% margin
               $58.9 billion Total Payment Volume, up 33% YoY and 49% FX-neutral
             $14.5 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 8% YoY and 56% FX-neutral



   To our Shareholders

  Mercado Libre had another great year in 2024, with more consumers and merchants choosing us, taking us
  past the milestones of 100mn annual unique buyers and 60mn Fintech MAUs for the first time. Engagement
  among these users is rising: retention and frequency on our marketplace are at record levels, as are payments
  and deposits per user in our digital account, and the number of merchants borrowing from us is higher than
  ever. The strength of our value proposition makes these trends possible, and we continue to invest to always
  offer the best user experience for individuals and merchants across Latin America.

  In 2024 we strengthened the value proposition of our digital account. Users in Brazil and Mexico receive
  market-leading deposit yields, and the increasing accuracy of our credit scoring models enabled us to offer
  more competitive card limits in Brazil. Cardholders receive extra installments on marketplace purchases, and
  those that are members of MELI+, our loyalty scheme, also receive cashback on purchases on- and off-
  platform and a lower free shipping threshold. This differentiated value proposition contributed to record NPS
  in Brazil and Mexico. It is also enabling us to serve segments of marketplace buyers that have historically not
  used Mercado Pago. This is important as we pursue the unique opportunity to cross-sell fintech services to our
  marketplace's 100mn unique buyers.

  We are also enhancing our marketplace value proposition, focusing on assortment, logistics and user
  experience (UX). We strengthened our position as a destination for brands in 2024. We welcomed official
  stores from premium brands such as Lancôme, Ralph Lauren and Lacoste, and other brands like Natura, the
  region's leading beauty brand. At the value end, we added hundreds of apparel manufacturers with their own
  brands. We had record levels of free shipments in 2024 and we continue to run the fastest network in the
  region - by far. We also invested more than ever in category-specific UX to improve the online buying
  experience in everything from autoparts to groceries. Our compelling value proposition attracted a record
  number of new buyers in 2024. It also puts us in a unique position to drive offline retail online in a region
  whose ecommerce penetration is almost a decade behind the USA.

  Our leading value proposition also enables us to deliver solid and sustainable financial results as we grow. For
  example the growing volume in our logistics network enhances cost efficiency. The credit card enables us to
  turn more users into ecosystemic users, with higher GMV and TPV. In Q4’24, this translated into record-
  breaking quarterly results for revenue, income from operations and net income. The quarter’s results show our
  teams are executing well and we have great momentum across the business.

Commerce

We continue consolidating our position as the top destination to buy online in Latin America, and this led to
GMV surpassing $50bn for the first time in 2024. The growth of unique buyers, which accelerated for the third
quarter in succession in Q4'24 (to 24% YoY), is also testament to this. This is the result of many years of
consistent investment in all aspects of our user experience. We will continue to invest because although we
are pleased to have reached 100mn unique buyers in 2024, we believe this number can be much higher in the
long-term. Our investments are also unlocking more purchasing activity among our buyers. For example, the
share of our unique buyers that purchase three or more categories per month has risen almost 20ppts over
the last five years. This is consistently ticking higher, and we think it also has much further to run.

These investments - in fulfillment, free shipping, marketing, loyalty and other areas that span our entire value
prop - led to another great year for our marketplace in 2024. They generated higher NPS and market share
gains in Brazil and Mexico, even against stiff competition, and profitable growth. In Q4'24, FX-neutral GMV
growth was solid in Brazil (+32% YoY) and Mexico (+28% YoY) as our teams in both countries executed
effectively through peak season. Our 1P offering played an important role in driving our strong results as it
accounted for eight of the top ten selling items during Black Friday in Brazil and all of the top ten sellers during
El Buen Fin in Mexico. That said, most of our GMV growth - and almost 95% of our GMV in dollars - is driven by
sellers’ assortment. Growth was solid across all categories and lower price ranges continued performing well.

Trends in Argentina are encouraging. Items sold grew 18% YoY in Q4'24, accelerating again even though we
faced a tough comparison against last year's pull-forward of demand. ASPs are growing at a slower pace than
inflation as the mix shifts in favor of staples, clothing and beauty. This shift towards high frequency categories
is a long-term positive for our business as it reinforces the shift of offline retail online. As improving macro
trends begin to drive a recovery of demand, we are optimistic about the growth opportunities ahead, and we
intend to invest accordingly.

Mercado Envios handled almost 1.8bn items in 2024, with over half a billion in Q4'24 alone. New facilities
helped us to grow the number of fulfilled items by 44% YoY in 2024, and to reach record fulfillment
penetration in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia in Q4'24. Operational execution was strong in
2024, with on-time deliveries hitting record highs and late deliveries reaching record lows. Productivity
improved across the fulfillment network, enabling us to invest more in faster and cheaper deliveries for buyers.
More buyers are choosing our slow shipping methods as they enable free shipping on a wider assortment of
products, while better service outside the main urban centers is stimulating new demand. These factors led to
a small YoY drop in deliveries made on the same or next day (to 49%), but they are generating incremental
GMV and engagement with our ecosystem. Furthermore, our delivery speed promises improved YoY, helped
by the launch of our Metro fulfillment centers in Brasilia and Porto Alegre.

As a result of our efforts to continuously improve our technology, we had a good peak season in Product and
Brand Ads, the latter driven partly by wider availability via our self-service platform. This helped ads revenue to
grow 41% YoY (88% FX-neutral) in Q4'24 and reach 2.1% of GMV. There is still a lot for us to do to scale our
advertising products, particularly Display and Video, to the levels we aspire to in the long-term.


Fintech Services

We are making excellent progress on our ambition to offer the best digital banking experience in Latin
America. NPS hit record levels in Brazil and Mexico in Q4'24 and the highest since 2021 in Argentina. This is
driving greater adoption, with strong trends across all three countries. MAUs rose 34% YoY to 61.2mn (with
even faster growth among heavy users), AUM grew 129% YoY to $10.6bn (due to the success of our yielding
account) and Insurtech active users surpassed 10mn for the first time.

                                                                                                Q4’24 Results



The Mercado Pago credit card is core to our value proposition and key to principality. Its strong performance
in 2024 reaffirmed our conviction in our ability and right to be one of the long-term winners in this market. Our
ability to win is grounded in our understanding of our users and the accuracy of our underwriting models.
These models are improving as they are periodically retrained, helping first-payment defaults reach their
lowest level ever in Brazil in December 2024. Our right to win is based on our existing user relationships and
our ability to use our ecosystem to differentiate our offer. This was evident in Q4'24 when Mercado Pago was
the most used credit card on the marketplace in Brazil for the first time on the eve of Black Friday.

The financial performance of the credit card continues to improve. All cohorts older than two years have
positive NIMAL spreads, with some reaching low double-digits, and newer cohorts are following a similar path
to profitability. The loss that the credit card is generating in our P&L in the short-term is a function of the size of
these new, immature cohorts relative to the old, mature cohorts that are profitable. As time passes, the ratio of
mature to immature cohorts will improve. More broadly, the credit card is positively impacting the ecosystem
with double-digit uplifts in GMV among cardholders.

Our merchant and consumer books are performing well, with strong profitability that more than offsets the
investment we are making in the credit card. Growth was solid across geographies, particularly in Argentina
where improving macro trends are supporting the approval of larger credit lines to more consumers. This
contributed to the total credit portfolio reaching $6.6bn (+74% YoY). The NIMAL spread of 27.6% in Q4'24 fell
YoY as the share of the credit card rose from 32% to 40% of our total credit portfolio and as we continued our
“move upmarket” to serve lower risk groups with lower rates. Positive seasonality helped to drive the QoQ
increase. Risk management is the top priority for our credit business, so we are pleased that asset quality
remains solid, with the 15-90 day NPL broadly stable QoQ at 7.4%.

Acquiring

We are positioning Mercado Pago as the acquirer that offers the best service to merchants in Latin America.
This is key to sustainable growth. Faster processing times, higher approval rates, wider availability of credit
and access to useful software are all drivers of lower churn and higher NPS. We are pleased to have taken our
first steps to offer software to merchants in Brazil, but we still have a lot of work to do to build the product that
matches our long-term ambition. Our long track record of providing acquiring services to our own marketplace
means we have a strong product in areas such as fraud prevention and approval rates. This value proposition
helped us increase market share in all of the countries where we operate in 2024. We ended the year on a
high note with Acquiring TPV growth accelerating on an FX-neutral basis in Brazil, Mexico and Chile in Q4'24.


Consolidated Financial Results

Net revenue and financial income rose to almost $21bn in 2024 from $15bn in 2023, up 38% YoY in USD.
Excluding shipping reporting updates, revenue grew by 25% YoY in USD and 86% YoY FX-neutral. It was also
a strong year for profits, with income from operations of $2,631mn (+6% YoY ex. non-recurring costs of
$281mn in FY'23) and net income of $1,911mn (+65% YoY ex. non-recurring costs of $173mn in FY'23).

We ended the year with strong momentum. Our Q4'24 net revenue & financial income of $6.1bn grew 24%
YoY in USD and 79% YoY FX-neutral, both excluding shipping reporting updates. On the same basis, FX-
neutral growth was strong across the region, with Brazil +45% YoY, Mexico +43% YoY and Argentina +180%
YoY.

                                                                                            Q4’24 Results


We set a new quarterly record of $820mn for income from operations in Q4'24. Growth was 23% YoY after
excluding non-recurring items of $332mn in Q4'23 (as detailed in last year's Shareholder Letter). The resulting
income from operations margin of 13.5% reflects a 60bps improvement from the prior year on a comparable
basis (as detailed in our earnings presentation). This margin expansion was driven by strong execution and
disciplined cost management across our logistics network, efficiencies in collection fees, and operating
leverage in Sales & Marketing and Product Development. These factors more than offset the margin headwind
caused by provisions for doubtful accounts.

The increase in provisions as a percentage of revenue is due to the rapid growth of the credit business and
the growing share of the credit card in the portfolio. There are two drivers of higher provisions in the
consolidated P&L as we grow rapidly: 1) when credit grows at a faster pace than the rest of the business,
provisions will rise as a percentage of sales because it is the only business that carries material provision
costs; and 2) we provision expected losses up front, at origination, and recognize revenue through the life of a
loan, so provisions are accrued sooner than revenue.

Furthermore, the credit card has higher provisions as a percentage of revenue - even for the same level of risk
as other credit products - because we provision against the full amount of the loans, but only generate interest
revenue on a relatively small portion (those that are late or have migrated to an installment plan). In summary,
the increase in provisions as a percentage of revenue is a natural consequence of the growth of our credit
business and the shift in mix towards the credit card. Credit quality remains sound, as demonstrated by stable
NPLs and lower provisions as a percentage of the portfolio. This, along with the strong NIMAL spread across
all products, gives us confidence to continue expanding our profitable credit business. We will closely monitor
the health of our credit portfolio, and if we detect any signs of deterioration, we will swiftly adjust and scale
back as needed - just as we have done in the past.

Net income reached $639mn in Q4'24, with significant growth of 67% YoY (excluding non-recurring costs in
Q4'23). For the year as a whole, we generated $1.3bn of adjusted free cash flow after a strong end to the year,
with $680mn in Q4'24 alone. We achieved this annual result after investing $860mn in capex, primarily to
scale our logistics network, and nearly $3bn in Fintech funding, most of which supported the expansion of our
credit book (see non-GAAP disclosures for more information). Our strong balance sheet, with a leverage ratio
of less than 1x, was further reinforced by the investment grade upgrade we received from Fitch in 2024.


Looking Ahead

We ended 2024 with fantastic momentum and we are optimistic as we look ahead to 2025 and beyond.
Investments that we have been making for years in our value proposition are bearing fruit and extending our
competitive advantages. We are seeing tangible evidence of the power of the ecosystem as each part of it
strengthens engagement in the others. This puts us in a unique position to explore the significant growth
opportunities offered by the shift of offline retail online, by providing better financial services to millions of
people and by the growing importance of first party data in advertising. We are as confident as ever that the
best is yet to come.

(1) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts. Growth calculations based on this table may not total due to rounding. As of December 31, 2024,
we decided no longer disclose the key performance indicator "Number of items shipped". Management believes that "Number of items shipped", as a
complementary disclosure to "items sold", no longer provides useful information to investors to better understand our business. Following years of
investment, our logistics network now ships 95% of items sold. As such, the two performance metrics, "Number of items sold" and "Number of items
shipped", have converged so we no longer see a benefit for investors in disclosing both.
(2) As of January 1, 2024, we no longer include peer-to-peer transactions neither in our TPV nor in our TPN, in accordance with the metrics and underlying
criteria used by our Mercado Pago team, which Management then employs to make strategic decisions. Consequently, total payment volume and
transactions for the twelve and three-month periods ended December 31, 2023, have been recast to exclude peer-to-peer transactions.

  Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance


    To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial
losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted
EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase
(decrease) in available cash and investments as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP
financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below.

    These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the
most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

     We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects
for the future.

Adjusted EBITDA

    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate
the effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest
expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net and income tax expense. We have included
this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to evaluate our operating
performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we
believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our
operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-
to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain items.

Net debt

     We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial
liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities
restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have
included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current
leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance
sheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to
investors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its
capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used
measures.

     The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the years indicated:

FX neutral

    We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by
excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results
and business outlook.

     The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month
during 2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results
would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next.The table below excludes
intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect
such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to
compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

    The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for
the three-month periods ended December 31, 2024:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments



Adjusted free cash flow

     Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and
cash equivalents and investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other
restrictions and equity securities held at cost, investments in property and equipment and intangible assets,
changes in loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial
liabilities related to our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital of the
Fintech activities. We consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides
useful information to management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with
its core activities that can be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce
debt. A limitation of the utility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial
representation of the total increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period.
Therefore, we believe it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our
entire consolidated statements of cash flows.



Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

     Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net
proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and
corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not
considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider
Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides
useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and
activities from the adjusted free cash flow.
