First Quarter 2019 Business Highlights1

•   Total payment volume through MercadoPago surpassed the $5.5 billion mark for the first time, reaching $5.6 billion, a year-
    over-year increase of 35.1% in USD and 82.5% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 93.7% year-
    over-year, totaling 143.9 million transactions for the quarter.
•   MercadoPago experienced continued success in execution of off-platform payments (online and offline) through merchant
    services, mobile point-of-sale (“MPOS”) devices, and the mobile wallet business. On a consolidated basis, off-platform total
    payment volume grew 118.8% year-over-year in USD and 194.2% on an FX neutral basis.
•   For the first time ever, off-platform payments processed over $2.5 billion in transactions, surpassing 80 million payment
    transactions in a single quarter with 88.2 million payment transactions.
•   MPOS business is still one of the fastest growing non-marketplace business units, representing 43.9% of total off-platform
    payment volume for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, MPOS total payment volume grew 260.4% year-over-year on an
    FX neutral basis.
•   Our mobile wallet again reached four times the number of active payers during the quarter as compared to the same period in
    2018, and total payment volume from mobile wallet in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico continued to reflect triple digits growth
    year-over-year.
•   Our asset management product, Mercado Fondo, is now available in Argentina and Brazil, where we offer our entire suite of
    FinTech solutions: MPOS devices, QR code in-store payments, mobile wallet and asset management.
•   Gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) reaccelerated surpassing the $3 billion mark, reaching $3.1 billion, a 1.7% year-over-
    year decrease in USD, and a 26.6% year-over-year increase on an FX neutral basis, following a decrease of 10.6% in USD
    and growth of 17.6% on an FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter of 2018.
•   Items sold reached 82.8 million, growing 3.3% year-over-year, compared to a growth of 50.8% in the first quarter of 2018.
    The decline in the year-over-year growth rate is attributable to Brazil, where in July of last year we launched the R$5 flat
    listing fee on items below R$ 120 and removed listings below R$ 6 as we shift towards incentivizing buyers to purchase
    higher-ticket items.
•   Unique buyers also reaccelerated increasing 10.8% year-over-year versus 7.5% during the fourth quarter of 2018.
•   Live listings offered on MercadoLibre’s marketplace surpassed for the first time the 200 million mark reaching 200.6 million
    in the first quarter of 2019, a 57.9% year-over-year increase.
•   Mobile gross merchandise volume grew 10.9% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis reaching 62.9% of GMV.
•   Items shipped through MercadoEnvios reached 62.9 million, an 18.6% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by the
    expansion of our free shipping program. The number of items shipped in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia were
    highlights of the quarter, growing 110.8%, 74.9%, 29.8% and 44.0%, respectively, year-over-year.

     convertible notes.

     over our Argentine Peso net asset position in Argentina.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (“FX”)
neutral measures.

This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure
is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not
reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP
financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measures.

Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the
tables included in this quarterly report.

The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides
investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe this
non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate
impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2018 and applying
them to the corresponding months in 2019, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable
from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any
other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment
to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.
