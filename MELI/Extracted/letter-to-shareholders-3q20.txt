 THIRD QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


▪ Net revenues for the third quarter were $1,115.7 million, a year-over-year increase of 85.0% in
  USD and 148.5% on an FX neutral basis, mainly attributable to commerce net revenues that
  continued accelerating and reached the highest historical growth rate.

▪ Commerce revenues increased 109.3% year-over-year in USD reaching $724.5 million, while
  Fintech revenues increased 52.3% year-over-year in USD reaching $391.2 million.

▪ Gross profit was $480.2 million with a margin of 43.0%, compared to 47.2% in the third quarter
  of 2019.

▪ Total operating expenses were $397.1 million, an increase of 8.4% year-over-year in USD. As a
  percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 35.6%, compared to 60.7% during the third
  quarter of 2019.

▪ Income from operations was $83.1 million, compared to a loss of $81.9 million during the third
  quarter of 2019. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations reached 7.4%.

▪ Interest income was $24.6 million, a 13.7% decreased year-over-year, as a result of lower
  interest rates in our investment as a consequence of the pandemic, mainly offset by higher
  interest income in Argentina due to higher float.

▪ The Company incurred $24.5 million in financial expenses this quarter, mainly attributable to
  financial loans entered into during the third quarter of 2020, mainly in Brazil and Argentina and
  interest expenses from our trusts related to the factoring credit card receivables in Argentina.

▪ This quarter we had a foreign exchange loss of $30.4 million mainly related to the difference of
  the Argentina’s official exchange rate and the blue chip swap rate at which we effectively carry
  out stock repurchases in Argentine Pesos. We also believe this presents the added benefit of
  generating greater transparency around FX rate distortions that arise as a consequence of
  Argentina’s multiple exchange rates.

▪ Net income before taxes was $52.7 million, up from a loss of $66.9 million during the third
  quarter of 2019.

▪ Income tax expense was $37.6 million, a decrease of 52.5% year-over-year, mainly as a result
  of valuation allowances accounted for on certain deferred tax assets in Mexico and Colombia
  during the third quarter of 2019. This decrease was offset by: i) higher income tax expense in
  Argentina as a consequence of the temporary suspension of the knowledge-based economy
  promotional regime in 2020, which had a direct impact on the income tax rate for our
  Argentine business, and a higher income tax expense as a consequence of higher pre-tax gain
  in our Argentine segment in 2020; ii) higher income tax expense in Brazil, as a consequence of
  higher pre-tax gain in our Brazilian segment during 2020; and iii) higher income tax expense
  due to withholding tax on dividends.

▪ Net income was $15.0 million, resulting in net earnings per share of $0.28.

          NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


        To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign
        exchange (“FX”) neutral measures.

        This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
        prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
        companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
        principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our
        results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should only
        be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial
        measures.

        Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be
        found in the tables included in this quarterly report.

        The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure
        provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future.
        Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by
        excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and
        business outlook.

        The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
        2019 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2020, so as to calculate what our results would have
        been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
        allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
        currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
        currency inflation or devaluations.

               The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations
               for the three months period ended September 30, 2020:
