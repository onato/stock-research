        THIRD QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


 Net revenues for the third quarter were $603.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 69.7% in USD and 90.5% on an FX neutral
  basis.

 Enhanced marketplace revenues increased 70.9% year-over-year in USD and 123.9% on an FX neutral basis, while non-
  marketplace revenues increased 68.6% year-over-year in USD and 120.8% on an FX neutral basis.

 Gross profit was $284.3 million with a margin of 47.2%, compared to 47.8% in the third quarter of 2018.

 Total operating expenses were $366.3 million, an increase of 102.7% year-over-year in USD. As a percentage of revenues,
  operating expenses were 60.7%, compared to 50.9% during the third quarter of 2018. Of the 848 bps of margin compression in
  operating expenses, 689 bps were the result of an increase in marketing and branding investments and 194 bps were the result of
  an increase in bad debt from our credits business in Brazil.

 Our marketing expenses alone increased $51.3 million QoQ during the quarter. The vast majority, $46.2M incremental dollars QoQ
  were deployed to branding initiatives allocating 60% behind Marketplace and 39% behind Payments.

 Loss from operations was $81.9 million, compared to a loss of $11.0 million during the third quarter of 2018. As a percentage of
  revenues, the loss from operations reached 13.6%.

 Interest income was $28.5 million, a 229.5% increase year-over-year, as a result of the proceeds of the 2028 Convertible Notes and
  equity offering in 2019, which generated more invested volume and interest gain and higher float in Brazil and Argentina.

 The Company incurred $14.5 million in financial expenses this quarter, mainly attributable to interest expense related to the 2028
  Convertible Notes and financial guarantees in Argentina.

 Foreign exchange gain this quarter was $1.0 million, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over our Argentine Peso net
  liability position in Argentina during the third quarter of 2019.

 Net loss before taxes was $66.9 million, up from a loss of $14.3 million during the third quarter of 2018.

 Income tax loss was $79.2 million, mainly as a result of valuation allowances accounted for on certain deferred tax assets in Mexico
  and Colombia.

 Net loss was $146.1 million, resulting in basic net loss per share of $2.96, due not only to the increased investment in marketing, but
  also a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Mexico and Colombia which accounted for $91.5 million and $7.2 million,
  respectively.

 Operating cash flow was $206.9 million. Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents was $328.6
  million, driven by higher proceeds from operating activities and lower proceeds used in investing activities.

         NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


     To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
     measures.

     This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
     with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not
     based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of
     the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure
     should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

     Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables
     included in this quarterly report.

     The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an
     overall understanding of the company current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes
     this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate
     impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

     The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2018 and applying them
     to the corresponding months in 2019, so as to calculate what the company results would have been had exchange rates remained
     stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include
     any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment
     to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.




            The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations
            for the three-month period ended September 30, 2019:
