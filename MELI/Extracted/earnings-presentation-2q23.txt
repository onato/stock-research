Key Messages
                      • > Brazil and Mexico stood out as the markets with the fastest proﬁt growth due to
Second Quarter 2023       solid operational KPIs, strong monetization and cost eﬃciency. These two markets
                          accounted for 64% of Q2’23 Direct Contribution, up from 58% in Q1’23 and Q2’22.

                      • > Quarterly Gross Merchandise Volume surpassed $10bn for the ﬁrst time, on the
                          back of FX-neutral growth of 47% year-on-year. Mexico’s FX-neutral GMV growth
                          accelerated to 34% YoY and Brazil’s remained solid at 25% YoY, implying major
                          market share gains based on third party data. On a consolidated basis, items sold
                          accelerated for the third successive quarter to reach 18% YoY in Q2’23.

                      • > We continue to invest in logistics to oﬀer the fastest delivery times across the
                          region; as such, fulﬁllment penetration rose to 46%, driven primarily by Brazil.

                          all major geographies that led to FX-neutral growth of 97% YoY. In Argentina,
                          Oﬀ-Platform TPV is signiﬁcantly above the country’s inﬂation rate.

                          as the annualized NIMAL* spread reached 37%, and broadly stable <90 day NPLs.
                          We are seeing good results from the cohorts of credit cards issued in recent months

commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform for transactions that occur
either on or oﬀ our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; commissions that we
charge from transactions carried out with Mercado Pago credit and debit cards; interest cash advances and fees from merchant and consumer credits
granted under our Mercado Credito solution; and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products and insurtech fees.                          1
