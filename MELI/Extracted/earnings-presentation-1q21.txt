 Pago platform for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; cash advances and fees from
 merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado Credito solution; and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products.
