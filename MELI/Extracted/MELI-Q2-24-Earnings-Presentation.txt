                      •   Mercado Libre grew strongly in Q2’24 with revenue of $5.1bn up 42% YoY and net income
                          up 103% YoY to $531mn. This was driven primarily by rapid growth in Brazil and Mexico, with
                          improving trends in Argentina.


Key Messages          •   Unique buyers (+19% YoY) and items sold (+29% YoY) both grew at the highest rate since
                          2021. Brazil posted the fastest growth on both measures in Q2’24, which led to its FX-neutral
                          GMV growth accelerating to 36% YoY. Mexico had another fine quarter with growth of 30%
Second Quarter 2024       YoY and Argentina’s GMV FX-neutral growth improved to 252% YoY.

                      •   Fintech MAU* surpassed 50mn for the first time, with growth of 37% YoY. Brazil delivered
                          the highest MAU growth (46% YoY). We see engagement rising across our geographies with
                          the 86% YoY growth in AUM** being a major driver and Insurtech being another.

                      •   The credit book reached $4.9bn, up 51% YoY. The credit card was the main growth driver,
                          with solid trends in Brazil and Mexico. Asset quality was robust, with the 15-90 NPL falling
                          110bps vs. Q1’24. NIMAL*** of 31.1% fell YoY due to higher credit card mix in the portfolio.

                      •   Acquiring growth remained resilient. Acquiring TPV of almost $34bn grew 24% YoY in USD,
                          with FX-neutral growth ticking up in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, whose TPV was higher YoY
                          despite the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.

 Changes in Mercado Pago TPV
In Q1’24, we updated the definition of TPV which excluded peer-to-peer transfers within Mercado Pago. This impacts Total and Fintech Services (previously “Digital Account”) TPV, but
Acquiring TPV is unchanged. We think the change creates a better metric for investors to track a business that has evolved from a payments wallet into a full fintech services platform.

To aid investors, the table below shows the recast TPV values for 2022 and 2023.
