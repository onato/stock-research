BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, February 26, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI)
(http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s leading e-commerce technology company, today reported financial results for
the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented, “I am pleased to report another quarter of solid
performance in our business, across our key business units. During the 4Q’18 we have continued our efforts to re-calibrate our
P&L with initiatives such as continued changes to our discounted shipping initiatives, and free listing caps, which allowed us to
improved enhanced marketplace monetization. As a consequence our Net Revenues accelerated for the 3rd consecutive quarter,
reaching 61.8% YoY on an FX neutral basis.”

Fourth Quarter 2018 Business Highlights1

•   Total payment volume through MercadoPago surpassed the $5 billion mark for the first time, reaching $5.3 billion, a year-
    over-year increase of 22.1% in USD and 68.5% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 71.7% year-
    over-year, totaling 125.6 million transactions for the quarter.
•   MercadoPago experienced continued success in execution of off-platform payments (online and offline) through merchant
    services, mobile point-of-sale (“MPOS”) devices, and mobile wallet business. On a consolidated basis, off-platform total
    payment volume grew 90.1% year-over-year in USD and 172.2% on an FX neutral basis.
•   For the first time ever, off-platform payments processed more than $2 billion in transactions, reaching almost 70 million
    payment transactions in a single quarter.
•   MPOS business is still one of the fastest growing non-marketplace business units, representing 46.6% of total off-platform
    payment volume for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, total payment volume grew 365.3% year-over-year on an FX neutral
    basis.
•   Our mobile wallet reached 4x more active payers during the fourth quarter than the same period of last year, while total
    payment volume from mobile wallet in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico is growing by triple digits year-over-year.
•   We launched our asset management product, MercadoFondo, in Brazil, the second country in which we have begun to offer
    our entire suite of FinTech solutions: MPOS devices, QR code in-store payments, mobile wallet and asset management.
•   Gross merchandise volume again surpassed the $3 billion mark, reaching $3.2 billion, a 10.6% year-over-year decrease in
    USD, and a 17.6% year-over-year increase on an FX neutral basis.
•   Items sold reached 85.6 million, growing 5.4% year-over-year versus 57.5% during the same period last year. The decrease
    year-over-year is attributable to Brazil, where last quarter we launched a R$5 flat listing fee on items below R$ 120 and
    removed listings below R$ 6 as we shift towards incentivizing buyers to purchase higher ticket items.
•   Unique buyers grew 7.5% year-over-year versus 9.4% in the third quarter. This declining growth rate is attributable primarily
    to pricing adjustments, including eliminating low-priced ticket items from our platform and making payments mandatory in
    Chile and Colombia, which also temporarily affected buyer growth.
•   Live listings offered on MercadoLibre’s marketplace grew to 182.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a 59.7% year-over-
    year increase, surpassing the 150 million mark for the third time.
•   Mobile gross merchandise volume grew 42.5% on an FX neutral basis year-over-year reaching 60.9% of GMV.
•   Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos reached 62.1 million, a 28.5% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by increases
    in our free shipping program. The number of items shipped in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia were highlights of the
    quarter, growing 84.0%, 88.3%, 72.0%, and 54.7% respectively year-over-year.

Adoption of ASC 606

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers related to revenue recognition
(“ASC 606”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has adopted ASC 606 using the full
retrospective transition method and has accordingly revised its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2017, and applicable interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2017, as if ASC 606 had been effective for those periods.
Because the Company did not offer free shipping in 2016, net revenue for that year does not need to be recast.

As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company must present net revenue net of amounts paid in connection with the Company’s
free shipping initiative, when the Company acts as an agent, rather than including these amounts in the cost of net sales, as
previously recorded. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 the Company incurred $108.1 million of shipping
subsidies that have been netted from revenues.

As a result of adopting ASC 606, our net revenues for the periods indicated below have been recast as presented below. Our
adoption of 606 does not affect our operating or net income/loss.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights

•    Net revenues for the fourth quarter grew to $428.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.5% in USD and 61.8% on an FX
     neutral basis.
•    Enhanced marketplace revenues increased 13.5% year-over-year in USD, and increased 51.9% on an FX neutral basis, while
     non-marketplace revenues increased 27.0% year-over-year in USD and 74.2% on an FX neutral basis.
•    Gross profit was $204.8 million with a margin of 47.8%, compared to 56.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Most of the gross
     margin compression is attributed to an increase in free shipping subsidies.
•    Total operating expenses were $205.6 million, down 23.3% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses
     were 48.0%, as compared to 74.8% during the fourth quarter of 2017.
•    Loss from operations was $0.8 million, down 92.6% from last quarter and 98.8% year-over-year in USD. As a percentage of
     revenues, loss from operations was 0.2%, compared to a loss of 18.0% during the fourth quarter of 2017.
•    Interest income was $14.3 million, a 60.9% increase year-over-year, mainly attributable to the effect of a stable FX in
     Argentina, a significant rise in interest rates, an increase in volume managed in Brazil and the proceeds of the convertible note
     issued in August 2018, which generated more invested volume and interest gains.
•    The company incurred $16.4 million in financial expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018, mainly attributable to financial interest
     related to the 2028 Convertible Notes and financial loans in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
•    The foreign exchange loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.9 million, mainly as a consequence of a $4.7 million loss
     from the U.S. Dollar revaluation over our Argentine Peso net asset position in Argentina, which was partially offset by a $0.9
     million gain arising from the appreciation of the Mexican Peso over our U.S. Dollar net liability position in Mexico.
•    Net loss before taxes was $6.8 million, up 89.5% year-over-year.
•    Income tax gain was $4.5 million during the fourth quarter, yielding a blended tax rate for the period of 65.8%.
•    Net loss as reported for the fourth quarter was $2.3 million, resulting in basic net loss per share of $0.05.
•    Operating cash flow was $34.8 million. Net decrease in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents was $613.0 million during
     the fourth quarter of 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (“FX”)
neutral measures.

This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure
is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not
reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP
financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measures.

Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the
tables included in this quarterly report.

The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides
investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe this
non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate
impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2017 and applying
them to the corresponding months in 2018, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable
from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any
other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment
to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month period
ended December 31, 2018:
