    Fourth Quarter 2022
    Key Messages

•    We had a successful year in 2022, with a strong fourth quarter helping us to reach new highs across the business, surpassing $100bn in total
     payments volume, $10bn of revenue, 1bn items shipped through Mercado Envios and $1bn of EBIT in 2022, all for the first time in our history.

•    Our fourth quarter EBIT margin of 11.6% increased substantially year-on-year, with efficiency in promotional spend and logistics, higher penetration of
     advertising and a strong performance across Mercado Pago, including Mercado Crédito, enabling us to offset seasonal margin headwinds in Commerce.

•    Our Commerce business performed well in the fourth quarter, and we extended our market share leadership in most markets, with particularly strong
     performances in Brazil and Mexico. We reached $9.6bn in Gross Merchandise Volume, with FX-neutral growth accelerating to 35% year-on-year.

•    Our delivery times continue to be the fastest across the region, helped by Mercado Envios reaching a new record of fulfillment penetration of 43%.

•    Our Fintech business continues to show strong momentum with Total Payment Volume reaching almost $36.0bn; off-platform TPV grew above 100%
     on a FX-neutral basis for the fifth consecutive quarter in Q4’22 and surpassed $25bn of TPV – an annualised run rate of over $100bn – for the first time.

•    Our Fintech take rate contracted slightly on a sequential basis as a result of lower credit revenues as a proportion of TPV when compared to Q3’22; the
     take rate of our other Fintech revenue streams was higher quarter-over-quarter.

•    Mercado Crédito's portfolio was broadly stable at $2.8bn as we took a cautious approach to originations. In Q4’22, our credit business delivered an
     annualized IMAL* spread of 48%, helped by improvement in asset quality, with our <90-day NPL falling sequentially to 10%, broadly flat year-on-year.

General Performance
•    Our <90 day NPL was broadly stable year-on-year, and fell sequentially to 10.3% as a result of better asset quality. The actions we took in mid-2022 to contain the risks of
     a weaker lending environment – particularly in Brazil – have had worked as intended.
•    Our >90 day NPL continued to rise as a result of the accumulation of prior period bad debts up to the moment of write-off at 360 days, alongside a portfolio whose
     duration is 2-3 months and originations that are growing at a lower pace than a year ago.
•    Our provision in Q4’22 was equivalent to 7.6% of the portfolio, a lower level than in previous quarter due to a lower risk portfolio overall and improved asset quality.
     Increased liquidity (thirteenth salary) and specific collection campaigns in Brazil also played a part in the decrease of the bad debt charge during the quarter.
•    We continue to have more than 100% of our >30 day past due portfolio provisioned.

Fintech revenues are generated from payments fees. Regarding our Mercado Pago service, we generate payment fees attributable to: commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off Marketplace platform transactions; commissions
from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; commissions that we charge from
transactions carried out with Mercado Pago credit and debit cards; interest cash advances and fees from merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado Credito solution; and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products and insurtech fees.                                         17
