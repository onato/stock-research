͏MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; February 22nd, 2024 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com),
 Latin America’s leading e-commerce and technology company, today reported financial results for the quarter
 ended December 31, 2023.

        Net Revenues of $4.3 billion, up 41.9% YoY & 83.2% YoY on an FX neutral basis
      Income from operations of $240 million ($572 million excluding one-off expenses)
   $56.5 billion Total Payment Volume, up 57.2% YoY & 153.2% YoY on an FX neutral basis
 $13.5 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 39.9% YoY & 79.5% YoY on an FX neutral basis


  To our Shareholders

  We look back on 2023 as a remarkable year for MercadoLibre. Remarkable not just because of our growth
  rates, major market share gains and significant margin expansion, but also as evidence that our long-term
  strategy is bearing fruit and that we are making the right investments to position our ecosystem as a long-term
  winner in Latin America’s commerce and financial services markets. We are seeing the powerful impact of the
  compounding of several years of investments in technology, which we believe is taking our user experience
  and value proposition to new levels, and enabling us to pursue our growth opportunities with efficiency and
  low-cost structures. As such, we delivered record revenue, income from operations and net income in 2023.


  Commerce

  The impact of this trend is particularly clear in Commerce, where growth in unique buyers accelerated to its
  fastest year-on-year pace since 2020, resulting in a total of almost 85mn for the full year in 2023. This helped
  us to achieve faster volume growth on top of the strong growth we delivered post-pandemic in 2022, which
  itself came on top of the tremendous growth of the 2020-21 pandemic period. More specifically, items sold
  grew 22% YoY in FY’23, and we finished the year on an even stronger note with YoY growth of 29% in Q4’23,
  with Brazil (31%) and Argentina (22%) accelerating sequentially, and Mexico continuing to deliver the highest
  growth (32%). Items Sold was the main driver of Q4’23 FX-neutral GMV growth in Brazil (35%) and Mexico
  (30%), whilst Argentina’s growth (235%) remained above inflation. This has added to our scale - with GMV for
  FY’23 hitting almost $45bn - and solidified our position as the leading ecommerce platform in the region.

  We strongly believe that the continuous improvement of our value proposition - much of which is driven by
  technology - is fundamental to our growth, and will continue to be so. As we continue to grow, we are working
  at a more granular level to focus on how we can improve our value proposition on a category-by-category
  basis. This has resulted in many small-scale innovations, a few of which are highlighted in this quarter’s
  earnings video, which make a difference to the user experience as they compound on top of other innovations
  over time. Furthermore, we believe this work is critical to unlocking future online market growth, and if our
  innovations are driving that growth, we would expect to have an outsized share of the incremental volume.

  The year also saw several large-scale additions to our Commerce value proposition. The relaunch of our
  loyalty program as Meli+ introduced MELI Delivery Day (MDD), a shipping option that enables subscribers of
  the program to schedule a day of the week on which they can access free shipping on items from
  approximately $6 (vs. the standard free shipping threshold of approximately $15). In Q4’23 we have seen
  MDD's positive impact on our value proposition. More specifically, the number of items delivered with free
  shipping reached new records in Brazil and Mexico, as did the number of items purchased per buyer. We are
  also delivering more items per vehicle on each last mile route, which increases density and reduces unit costs.




                                                                                                                     2

                                                                                           Q4’23 Results

We had our most competitive offer ever in Consumer Electronics (CE) - still the largest single online category
in Latin America - as a result of the transformation of our first-party (1P) business. By expanding the use of
technology to manage pricing, selection and inventory, together with stronger supplier relationships, we have
become more competitive whilst achieving better margins. This has given us the confidence to push harder for
growth in CE, as was evident through the Black Friday promotional campaign in Brazil during which the
category grew 140% YoY on an FX-neutral basis at MercadoLibre (despite an overall decline in the market).
For Q4’23 as a whole, 1P GMV grew 85% YoY on an FX-neutral basis, with Brazil growing at a triple digit rate.

Offering the best value proposition to sellers is also fundamental to our business, and we continue to deploy
technology to facilitate their growth. In 2023, we launched capabilities that enable sellers to create their own
promotional coupons and answer buyer questions more quickly with the assistance of artificial intelligence.
We also launched our new Affiliates program and ramped-up of our short-format Clips videos to introduce
more social media tools that drive traffic to sellers’ listings. We also improved delivery timeframe promises on
our product pages. All of these improvements to our vale prop help sellers to boost their sales and conversion.

Our logistics network is a competitive advantage that supports our sellers by offering a world-class delivery
experience to our buyers. This is particularly the case with our fulfillment network, which in 2023 shipped a
total of 650mn items, 45% more than the prior year. The investments we are making in our fulfillment
infrastructure are crucial to building on our buyer and seller value proposition. More specifically in Q4’23,
fulfillment penetration in Brazil rose 10ppts YoY to almost 50% of shipments, and new facilities came onstream
in Mexico to help to ease some of the pressure on a network that has been running at full capacity. We
continue to deliver more than half of shipments on the same or next day, and this metric was stable YoY at
52% in Q4’23 despite a higher number of packages with slower MELI Delivery Day shipping and a larger
number of deliveries made to more distant regions. We have also expanded our heavy & bulky capabilities,
with a 73% YoY increase in shipments processed through our network in Q4’23.

We welcomed almost 50,000 new advertisers to our Ads platform in 2023, which we believe is an indication
of its importance to sellers, and the strength of our product. This is particularly the case amongst the small-
and medium-sized sellers that make up a majority of our marketplace, and use our advertising platform on a
self-service basis. We are also excited to have launched technology that facilitates advertising on our platform
for big brands and the agencies that work on their behalf, and we look forward to its continued maturation in
2024 and beyond. Advertising continues to make an important contribution to our commerce services
revenues, with consistent growth that remained above 70% on an FX-neutral basis for the seventh successive
quarter in Q4’23. As GMV grew at an even faster pace (79% YoY on an FX-neutral basis), Ads penetration was
slightly lower QoQ at 1.6% of GMV in Q4’23; on an annual basis, penetration rose to 1.6% (of $45bn) in FY’23
from 1.3% (of $34bn) in FY’22.

Our Fintech services are also contributing positively to our Commerce value proposition, with the Mercado
Pago credit card now amongst the five largest credit cards for payments on our marketplace in Mexico and not
far from this mark in Brazil.


Digital Account & Credits

Our Digital Account & Credits strategy has gained momentum over the last 12 months, with major increases in
the number of people engaging with our credit products, debit card, savings, investments and insurance
products. For example, the number of users of our remunerated account doubled in 2023 to reach 30mn at
the end of the year, with large increases in each of our three largest geographic segments. With more people
using the account and receiving attractive levels of interest on their funds, more people are able to see the
great experience and product stack that we offer. We believe this positions us well to develop deep
relationships and to cross-sell other products and services over time. This is also strengthening our brand, with
higher spontaneous awareness of Mercado Pago as a digital account in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.




                                                                                                                    3
                                                                                             Q4’23 Results


We are pleased with the progress we have made with the Mercado Pago credit card in 2023. We accelerated
issuance in Brazil and launched in Mexico, which led to a 63% YoY increase in TPV for FY’23, and we ended
the year on a stronger note with 154% YoY growth in Q4’23. Having started the year with cautious optimism
that we had resolved the problems we encountered when we first launched the credit card in Brazil in
2021/22, we ended the year with hard data to support that optimism. Delinquency has remained broadly
stable at acceptable levels in recent quarters and the performance of recent cohorts in Brazil gives us
confidence that we are on the right track to scale the product profitably. It is still early days in Mexico, but so
far the credit card is performing as expected and we are confident that our proprietary data will be a major
competitive advantage as we build this product over the coming years. In both countries, we expect the credit
card to be a key driver of principality amongst a portion of our user base, with positive knock-on effects across
the ecosystem.

Being part of an ecosystem is fundamental to the success of our credit business overall and its strong
performance in 2023 is testament to our ecosystemic competitive advantages in distribution and underwriting,
our cautious management of risk and our geographic diversification. The business was well-positioned to
reaccelerate growth in the second half of 2023 and, as such, we ended the year with a total credit portfolio of
almost $3.8bn (+33% YoY) and almost 20mn users (+95% YoY). The credit card and the Brazil consumer book
were the main drivers of QoQ growth (partially offset by a contraction of the Argentina book as a result of the
devaluation of the Argentine Peso). We are also making good progress with merchants, as the number of
merchants taking credit from us surpassed 1.5mn for the first time and the portfolio reached $761mn.

Our 15-90 day NPL - a new disclosure, which we think is a better way to monitor early delinquency trends than
1-90 because many customers simply forget to pay their bills, and do so shortly after their bills have become
late - has been broadly stable through the year as a whole, and ended the year at 8.2% in Q4’23. Our NIMAL
spread has also been broadly stable through the year (with the exception of the seasonally weak Q1), which
highlights our continued ability to price risk accurately, and we finished the year on a high note of 39.8%. We
maintain a highly profitable lending business; our NIMAL spread is part of this, but so too is a cost-to-serve that
is broadly in-line with the lowest amongst our major peers in Brazil.

The other fintech services we offer through our digital account are a key piece of our value proposition. Our
remunerated account continues to show very encouraging trends, with funds deposited in the account in
Q4’23 more than 2x higher YoY in Brazil, almost 4x in Mexico and more than 6x in Argentina (all in local
currency). We also launched this service in Chile in December. These figures point to rising user engagement
with our fintech services, which is critical as we look to develop deep relationships and cross-sell other
products. In Argentina, where we have seen the most growth in deposited funds, we see a positive knock-on
impact on payment flows in the Digital Account, for example. This was the primary driver of Argentina’s off-
platform TPV growth (FX-neutral) of 313% YoY in Q4’23, a growth rate that has accelerated in real terms for the
last two quarters.

Acquiring

Our Acquiring services, which include Online, POS and QR payments, processed $116bn of TPV in 2023
(growing 83% YoY on an FX-neutral basis), which makes us one of the largest independent fintech acquirers in
LatAm. The business leverages the technology and knowhow that has developed in our ecosystem over many
years. We believe this has enabled us to build a competitive product that has positioned us well to take
advantage of the large market share opportunities that we see across the region. Being part of the ecosystem
also enables us to cross-sell other services, as we highlighted with the example of merchant credit above.

Throughout the year, we have seen strong FX-neutral growth trends across our geographic segments in
Online Payments, whilst POS growth in Mexico continues to stand out (in the triple digits) and QR in Argentina
accelerates in real terms on the back of higher engagement with our digital account. In Brazil, we are starting
to see positive results from our decision to reorganize our POS go-to-market, with more efficiency in the sales
process (ramping up sales on our own marketplace, for example) and higher activation rates, which is
shortening payback periods and leading to a pick up in growth. Acquiring growth trends remained healthy in
Q4’23 and contributed to off-platform TPV growth of 47% and 96% YoY (FX-neutral) in Brazil and Mexico
respectively in Q4’23; both YoY growth rates accelerated when compared to YoY growth rates in the previous
quarter.

Consolidated Results

We are pleased to report another set of strong financial results in Q4’23. Revenue of $4,261mn grew 42% YoY,
with another strong quarter in Brazil (46% YoY) and Mexico (51% YoY). We also saw solid growth trends in
Commerce (48% YoY) and Fintech (34% YoY), with the former boosted by a step up in first-party product sales,
and the latter supported by a pick up in credit revenues. For the full year in 2023, revenue reached almost
$14.5bn, up 37% YoY and more than 6x its 2019 level.

Income from operations for Q4’23 was $240mn and was negatively impacted by one-off expenses of $351mn
associated with contingent tax liabilities mostly related to prior periods. Excluding one-off expenses related to
previous quarters (but including all expenses related to Q4'23), our 5.6% income from operations margin
would have been 13.4%, a 270bps YoY gain. This is consistent with our ambition of gradual margin expansion
whilst continuing to invest in growth.

The one-off expenses will not have a material cash impact as most of the values in question were accumulated
in judicial accounts and booked as non-current assets during the corresponding periods, as disclosed in
previous Form 10-Ks. The first one-off expense of $320mn relates to ongoing legal proceedings initiated in
2014 that dispute the Brazilian federal tax authority’s ability to charge withholding income tax over payments
remitted by our Brazilian subsidiaries to our Argentine subsidiary for the provision of IT support and other
services on the grounds that it would violate a convention signed by the two countries to avoid double
taxation. Based on recent developments, our legal advisor's view is the risk of losing the case is now probable.
We booked $58mn of the provision in cost of revenue and $261mn in product development expenses. The
total operating expense related to this one-off and incurred in 2023 was approximately $70mn.

The second one-off expense of $31mn - booked in cost of revenue - relates to a recent ruling from Brazil’s
highest court that the DIFAL sales tax must be paid for the period April to December 2022, while the legality
of the tax was being questioned. The tax was legally reinstated in January 2023 and has been booked in our
P&L and paid as an ongoing expense since then; the one-off expense booked in Q4'23 relates solely to the 9-
month period in 2022 mentioned above.

Given the size of the one-off expenses, in this particular quarter we believe our performance is better-
understood by looking at our financials excluding these impacts, as per the table below.

Income from operations on an ongoing basis grew 78% YoY and the margin expanded by 270bps. We are
pleased with this performance as it continues the trends that we saw in previous quarters whereby our growth
has been driving greater scale which, combined with cost efficiency, is leading to operating leverage. This
trend was particularly evident in Brazil in Q4’23. Each of our four operating expense lines showed YoY dilution
on a consolidated basis when we exclude one-off expenses in Q4'23. We achieved this strong growth and
margin expansion despite headwinds from: 1) a lower contribution from net shipping revenue, which negatively
impacted our take rate, as a result of higher levels of free shipping in Brazil and Mexico, cost increases in
Brazil (which had been postponed earlier in the year) and higher-than-expected peak season volume; 2)
investments in our fulfillment infrastructure, with new capacity coming onstream in Mexico City, León and
Minas Gerais; and 3) a larger contribution from our first-party (1P) business, whose margins continue to be
lower than the company average. As noted in previous earnings events, investing in 1P and shipping are
strategic priorities as we seek to offer the best value proposition to our users. Gross margin was negatively
impacted by revenue mix as a result of lower shipping revenue, higher 1P revenue and a smaller contribution
from credit revenue than the prior quarter.

In Q4'23, we delivered net income of $165mn on a reported basis and $383mn (+166% YoY) excluding one-off
expenses. We incurred FX losses of $107mn, of which $79mn relate to repatriation of funds in Argentina.
Additional FX losses related to the revaluation of assets & liabilities in Argentina (primarily cash held in
Argentine pesos losing value in US dollars) were only $62mn, despite the large devaluation of the Argentine
Peso in mid-December 2023. The balance comes from small FX gains in our other geographies. For FY’23, we
reached a new record of almost $1bn of net income on a reported basis and $1.2bn if we were to exclude the
one-off expenses.

Given the ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso vs. the US dollar, as in previous quarters we are
providing investors with additional information, including the table below which shows certain P&L items
denominated in Argentine pesos.

If we were to simulate having translated Argentine peso revenues and costs to US dollars at the blue chip
swap rate, rather than the official exchange rate, for the 12-month period to December 31, 2023, we estimate
that income from operations would have been $464mn lower than our reported income from operations of
$1,823mn (or $2,104mn excluding the one-off expenses mentioned earlier) due to the gap between the two
rates. However, that gap also means we incurred significant FX losses related to our Argentine operations as a
result of our repatriation of funds, which amounted to $465mn for the same 12-month period. Those
repatriations are done at the blue chip swap rate, which had an average spread of approximately 102% over
the official exchange rate for the 12-month period to December 31, 2023. As a result of our cash management
strategy in Argentina, we believe that our net income and cash flow already incorporate much of the potential
effect of a devalued exchange rate. We estimate the impact of the simulation described above on our net
income for the 12-month period to December 31, 2023, to be broadly neutral to slightly positive.

Our strong P&L performance was reflected in our cash generation, with cash and cash equivalents up by
$385mn in Q4’23 vs. Q3’23 and $646mn year-to-date. Capex investments have totaled $509mn this year as
we continue to invest in our logistics network. Debt ratios have improved materially on the back of our strong
results and cash flow, with net debt to EBITDA falling to less than 1.0x in Q4’23 from 1.5x a year ago.

Looking Ahead

We look back on 2023 as a remarkable year in which we delivered strong top line growth, market share gains
in most countries and improved operating margins, whilst continuing to invest in growth. As we look forward to
2024 and beyond, it’s business as usual at MercadoLibre. This means our teams are working tirelessly to offer
the best experience and value proposition to our users, focusing on executing with excellence and pursuing
our strategic goals. In the long-term, we are confident in our ability to repeat the combination of growth, scale,
cost efficiency and operating leverage that drove margins higher in 2023. This will give us an even stronger
base from which to pursue our long-term mission of democratizing commerce and financial services in Latin
America. We are as optimistic as ever about the growth opportunities that this mission provides to us and we

(*) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts. Growth calculations based on this table may not total due to rounding.
(**) As from January 1, 2022, we no longer disclose our total volume of payments on marketplace net of shipping and financing fees. Given the growth of our
shipping and fintech businesses, management believes that including shipping and financing fees in the calculation of total volume of payments on
marketplace results in a more accurate indicator of that performance on a go-forward basis. Consequently, total volume of payment on marketplace for the
twelve and three month periods ended December 31, 2022 has been recast to include shipping and financing fees.
(***) Net interest margins after losses (“NIMAL”) represents the annualized ratio between the total credits revenues less funding costs and provision for
doubtful accounts for the period and total average gross loans receivable for the period. Management uses NIMAL to monitor how effectively the Company is
pricing and managing the credit products relative to their risk and setting targets. Accordingly, management is of the opinion that NIMAL provides useful
information to investors and others related to the Company’s risk appetite through the different periods and shows how the Company effectively prices risk.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance


To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses,
foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings of
unconsolidated entity (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt and foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-
GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measures can be found in the tables below.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the
most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure
provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the
future.


Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the
effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense
and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an
unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our
Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation
of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it
provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain
items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial
liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and long-term investments, excluding foreign government debt securities restricted and held in
guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have included this non-GAAP
financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios and set
targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash flows and
income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other
market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of repayment
as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

 FX neutral

 We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by
 excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results
 and business outlook.

 The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
 2022 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2023, so as to calculate what our results would have
 been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
 allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
 currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
 currency inflation or devaluations.

 The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
 three-month period ended December 31, 2023:
