    SECOND QUARTER 2020 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

▪ Unique active users grew 45.2% reaching 51.5 million.

▪ Gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) reached $5.0 billion, representing an increase of 48.5% in USD and
  101.5% on an FX neutral basis.

▪ Items sold reached 178.5 million, growing 101.4% year-over-year.

▪ Live listings offered on MercadoLibre’s marketplace reached 289.0 million, a 26.2% year-over-year
  growth.

▪ Mobile gross merchandise volume grew 272.8% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, reaching 69.4% of
  GMV.

▪ Even through these trying times and surge in managed volumes, Mercado Envios was able to ship 157.5
  million items during the quarter without any significant disruptions, representing a 124.2% year-over-year
  increase.

▪ Total payment volume (“TPV”) through Mercado Pago reached $11.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of
  72.1% in USD and 142.1% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 122.9% year-over-
  year, totaling 404.8 million transactions for the quarter.

▪ Off-platform TPV grew 92.1% in USD and 174.7% year-over-year on a FX neutral basis reaching $6.1 billion
  in transactions and 280.7 million payments, a 133.7% year-over-year growth.

▪ Merchant Services had a strong performance, aided by the shift to e-commerce consumption, accelerating
  sequentially to 163.9% on an FX neutral basis.

▪ Mobile wallet delivered $2.1 billion in transactions on a consolidated basis, leading to also 373.2% year-
  over-year growth on an FX neutral basis. Our mobile wallet consumer base grew by 109.3% compared to
  the second quarter of 2019, reaching 9.5 million unique payers. TPV from mobile wallet in Argentina, Brazil
  and Mexico continues to grow by triple digits year-over-year.

▪ On a consolidated basis MPOS TPV grew 80.1% on an FX neutral basis, decelerating sequentially around
  20%, mainly due to lower foot traffic as a consequence of partial or total lockdowns throughout the region.
  The resilience that our MPOS business showed during the quarter is a result of the long tail base of
  merchants we cater to plus a relevant share of merchants who continued to operate their business with
  lesser disruptions throughout the lockdowns.

▪ The pace of sales of devices reached a milestone this quarter, surpassing the 1 million mark of new MPOS
  sold throughout Latin America.

▪ PayPal is now available for cross-border transactions on Mercado Libre in Brazil and Mexico and is also
  available as a payment option within Mercado Pago’s online checkout for foreign shoppers.
 SECOND QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


▪ Net revenues for the second quarter were $878.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 61.1% in
  USD and 123.4% on an FX neutral basis.

▪ Commerce revenues increased 79.5% year-over-year in USD reaching $581.7 million, while
  Fintech revenues increased 34.1% year-over-year in USD reaching $296.7 million.

▪ Gross profit was $427.2 million with a margin of 48.6%, compared to 50.0% in the second
  quarter of 2019.

▪ Total operating expenses were $327.7 million, an increase of 15.0% year-over-year in USD. As
  a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 37.3%, compared to 52.3% during the
  second quarter of 2019. The $14.8 million improvement in operating expenses quarter-over-
  quarter was mostly driven by marketing expenditure efficiencies.

▪ During the quarter we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivables from a
  Mercado Pago collection agent, for $26.7 million. Upon review we realized that collection
  efforts for these receivables had not been carried out effectively, and that the ageing of these
  receivables exceeded what our internal control policies allow. We assessed the impact of this
  matter on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and have included the results of that
  assessment in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020.

▪ Income from operations was $99.4 million, compared to a loss of $29.7 million during the prior
  quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the income from operations reached 11.3%.

▪ Interest income was $18.8 million, a 44.2% decreased year-over-year, as a result of lower
  interest rates in our investment as a consequence of the pandemic.

▪ The Company incurred $27.0 million in financial expenses this quarter, mainly attributable to
  financial loans entered into during the second quarter of 2020, mainly in Brazil and Argentina
  and interest expenses from our trusts related to our factoring business and the 2028
  Convertible Note.

▪ Net income before taxes was $89.3 million, up from a loss of $16.7 million during last quarter.

▪ Income tax expense was $33.4 million, mainly as a result of higher income tax expense in
  Brazil, as a consequence of higher pre-tax gain in our Brazilian segment during 2020; valuation
  allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Mexico accounted for in the first half of 2020 and
  higher income tax expense in Argentina as a consequence of the temporary suspension of the
  knowledge-based economy promotional regime in 2020, which had a direct impact on the
  income tax rate for our Argentine business.

▪ Net income was $55.9 million, resulting in net earnings per share of $1.11.

       NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


    To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign
    exchange (“FX”) neutral measures.

    This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
    prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
    companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
    principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our
    results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should only
    be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial
    measures.

    Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be
    found in the tables included in this quarterly report.

    The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure
    provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future.
    Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by
    excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and
    business outlook.

    The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
    2019 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2020, so as to calculate what our results would have
    been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
    allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
    currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
    currency inflation or devaluations.

          The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations
          for the three months period ended June 30, 2020:
