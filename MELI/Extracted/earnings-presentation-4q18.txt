Fourth Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Logistics - MercadoEnvíos
   • MercadoEnvios penetration surpassed 80% of items sold on a consolidated basis for the first time as we push for mandatory adoption
     in Brazil and Mexico and activated new categories and adjusted ASP thresholds in Chile and Colombia to boost adoption of our
     shipping solution.

   • MercadoEnvios adoption gains in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are also worth noting. Brazil gained 11 percentage points, up to 91%,
     Argentina gained 16 percentage points, up to 49%, and Mexico gained 14 percentage points, up to 94%.

   • Continued expanding our free shipping solution to our buyers. Free shipping penetration as a percentage of GMV shipped increased 11
     percentage points YoY, reaching 82% on a consolidated basis during the quarter.

   • Made inroads on shifting volume to managed network during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, over 20% of all shipments were
     handled through our network of fulfillment and cross docking. Penetration of managed network reached 17% in Brazil, 15% in Mexico,
     and 55% in Argentina.

   • During the quarter, mean delivery times have improved 30% on a YoY basis, allowing us to deliver 50% of our shipments in 3 days or
     less on a consolidated basis.
Fourth Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Marketplace
   • Continued our efforts to recalibrate our P&L with directed initiatives, such as capping free listings per seller to improve marketplace
     monetization and gross transactional revenues, while also improving assortment and discovery to deliver a more robust and customer-
     centric user experience on our platforms.

   • Since the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation as of December 1, 2017, FX Neutral GMV grew a solid 30.8% YoY in Q4’18,
     excluding Venezuela on a consolidated basis.

   • Official Stores initiative gained traction during the quarter as well. Driven by special dates, Official Stores penetration as a percentage of
     GMV was solid in our main countries: Mexico 14.2% (vs. 7.1% LY), Brazil 12.8% (vs. 8.6% LY), and Argentina 12.8% (vs. 10.2% LY).

   • The growth in Official Stores GMV is attributable to solid commercial efforts to on-board well-known brands, as well our strengthened
     Intellectual Proprietary Program, which gives brands better tools to increase their comfort level with selling on MercadoLibre and their
     share of purchases during special dates. During Q4’18, we on boarded the likes of Estee Lauder, cosmetics brand MAC, and the Gap.

   • In Brazil, in spite of the launch of flat fee and the removal of listings below R$6, live listings accelerated to 57.3% YoY as we deepen
     SKU count and remain the marketplace of choice when it comes to assortment and depth of selection in Latin America.
Fourth Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Payments – MercadoPago
   • Off-platform TPV surpassed the $2 billion mark for the first time ever, reaching $2.1 billion. MPoS continues to grow triple digits (in USD
     and LC) gaining share of off-platform TPV. Consolidated MPoS TPV grew 365.3% YoY on and FX neutral basis, driven by sustained
     growth of our installed base of devices in Brazil and Argentina.

   • During the quarter, we also made inroads in the buildout of our alternative payments network through our mobile wallet initiative. For the
     three months ended December 31st, 2018, our digital mobile wallet was used by millions active payers, reaching an active base of
     payers that was 4 times larger than a year ago. Mobile wallet total payment transactions also delivered solid results growing north of
     450% YoY.

   • QR code in-store payments already reached over 40% of wallet TPV in Argentina (where we first launched our complete FinTech
     ecosystem). Successfully on-boarded high-frequency ubiquitous merchants like McDonald's, which already ranks number 1 on QR in-
     store payments TPV less than two months after launch.

   • Continued rolling out and scaling the building blocks of our mobile wallet ecosystem, including the launch of our asset management
     solution, MercadoFondo, for individuals and merchants in Brazil.

   • In Argentina, within six months of launch, funds invested through MercadoFondo represented almost 40% of MercadoPago stored
     balances. Results in Brazil are also encouraging, as the amount of money invested as a percentage of MercadoPago stored balances
     is already higher than Argentina’s results within one month of launch.
Fourth Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Credits - MercadoCredito
   • We continue deepening further the engagement and lock-in of our users, while also generating additional touchpoints and incentives to
     use MercadoPago as an end-to-end financial solution as we scale our Merchant and Consumer Credit business. Specifically in Brazil,
     we have improved our credit scoring algorithm and built a collections team which has resulted in lower merchant delinquency rates
     despite growing our pace of originations and expanding our user base.

   • Additionally, we have successfully raised third-party funding in Brazil and Argentina as our merchant credit business gains traction and
     scales off our balance sheet. During the quarter we raised more than US$ 31MM from the Inter American Development Bank, while in
     Argentina we issued our second public trust with a 2x oversubscription.
Fourth Quarter 2018 Quarterly Highlights
Financial Results
    • Delivered the 19th consecutive quarter of consolidated gross billings growth above 60% YoY on an FX neutral basis. The robust growth
      we delivered this quarter was driven in part by improved monetization on marketplaces, as well as a continued pace of execution in our
      off-platform revenue streams, particularly in payments.

    • Net revenues also continue to grow at a healthy clip as we continue to optimize how we offer shipping subsidies to our buyers and
      sellers. Consequently, revenues grew a solid 62% YoY in an FX neutral basis.

    • Gross profit remained stable versus last year in spite of greater investments in shipping subsidies, increasing to $204.8 million and
      representing 47.8% of revenues during the quarter.

    • Operating expenses (“OPEX”) increased to $205.6 million, representing 48% of revenues, in comparison to 75% of revenues in Q4’17
      due to charges resulting from the deconsolidation of Venezuela during Q4’17.

    • Excluding the $85.8 million of the deconsolidation charges in Q4’17, operating expenses would have been $182.2 million dollars, or
      51% of net revenues, resulting in a year on year OPEX scale of 285bps. Main drivers of OPEX scale this quarter was mainly attributed
      to Sales & Marketing, Product Development Expenses, and G&A mostly in salaries & wages growing at a slower clip than revenues.
      For comparative purposes, if we exclude the Venezuelan deconsolidation charges, OPEX as a percentage of gross billings was 38%
      this quarter versus 42% the same quarter a year ago, a 335 basis point leverage in operational expenses.

    • Delivered the lowest net loss since Q4’17, reaching $(2.3) million, resulting in basic net loss per share of $0.05 cent.
