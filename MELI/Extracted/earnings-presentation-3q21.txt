Operational & Financial Key Messages
 •   Once again reached new records in gross merchandise volume, payment volumes and credit portfolio size; which demonstrate resilience and strength across all
     parts of our ecosystem.

 •   The “Impacts that Matter” study, released in September with Euromonitor, revealed that our platforms have underpinned the main source of income for over 900
     thousand families in our region and we generated 6 new jobs per hour in 2020 through our ecosystem.

 •   Our user base is growing in volume and improving in engagement, with satisfaction rates improving across the platform. GMV is expanding consistently as we
     continue to develop product assortment and improve on shipping service levels.

 •   We are generating a lot of momentum in our fintech business, but believe this is only the beginning. We are offering a more robust breakdown of our total
     payments volume, including Acquiring TPV and Digital Account TPV so that the investment community can see under the hood, and better measure the various
     growth drivers in the platform.

 •   The Credit business, for both Consumer and Merchants, is growing while sustaining profitability of the previous quarter.

 •   Overall profitability at the EBIT and Net Income levels are improving compared to last year. Excluding the one-off, non-recurring effects, including the retroactive
     tax benefits recognized in Q3, Net Income profitability would be around 2% margin.

 Fintech revenues are generated from payments fees. With respect to our Mercado Pago service, we generate payment fees attributable to: commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume
 processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off Marketplace platform transactions; commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado
 Pago platform for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; cash advances and fees from
 merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado Credito solution; and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products.
