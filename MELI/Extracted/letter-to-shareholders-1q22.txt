MercadoLibre, Inc.

Reports
First Quarter 2022

May 5th, 2022
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, May 5th, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq:
MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s leading e-commerce technology
company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

     Net Revenues of $2.2 billion, up 67.4% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis
               Income from operations of $139 million, with a 6.2% margin
 $25.3 billion Total Payment Volume, up 81.2% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis
$7.7 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 31.6% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis


                                          To our Shareholders

                   We kicked off 2022 with a strong first quarter across all businesses, following a record year in
2021. Mercado Libre is coming out of the pandemic period stronger than we were two years ago with a more
mature business at scale, a larger team with complementary capabilities and much better services and
experiences for our users in all of our key geographies. While the business is stronger than ever before, we are
facing a challenging backdrop with uncertainty surrounding consumer spending, higher interest rates and
higher inflation in addition to coming out of a period of social mobility restrictions in key markets. Given this
juxtaposition, we have planned the year ahead to draw on our strengths through innovation and resilience, and
will prioritize opportunities that will impact our entire ecosystem.


                                                 Commerce

                In the commerce business, we drove sustained growth during the first quarter. Gross
Merchandise Volume was almost $7.7 billion dollars, growing approximately 27% on a USD basis and nearly
32% on an FX-neutral basis, the same level of growth as the fourth quarter of 2021 despite tougher comps.
Notably, the two-year CAGR trend on an FX-neutral basis has remained above 70% for the last five quarters.
Argentina and Brazil led all markets in the period with respect to GMV growth and benefitted year-over-year
from improvements in engagement and buyer frequency. In our key markets, unique buyers in the quarter
improved versus last year, and we reached almost 40 million buyers on a consolidated basis.

                  We sold almost 267 million items in Q1 alone. With nearly 330 million live listings in the first
quarter, our marketplace provides a wide range of products through our diverse seller base, catering to several
shopping missions and user profiles. This unique product mix which is made possible by our vast array of
sellers is a determining factor for the resilience of our platform in times of possible restraints on consumption or
pressures on discretionary spending. We saw continued positive trends in our shopping conversion rates,
despite the tough comparison period. The improved platform-wide user experience and assortment, paired
with the quality of service we increasingly offer, is driving greater stickiness with both buyers and sellers

                 On service quality, the advertising service has been a core area of focus for us to create better
offerings for sellers that want to optimize their buyer conversion rates. The advertising business has been
improving in performance consistently over the last year, which was a period of investment that enabled us to
enhance the algorithm technology that enables us to deploy ads effectively based on users’ searches. There
are several opportunities to create more layers of advertising real estate across our platforms and offer sellers
highly effective digital marketing investment opportunities to drive more conversion and boost brand
awareness. In the first quarter, ad revenues nearly doubled year-over-year. We are confident that this is only
the beginning for this part of our business.
                  Shipping through Mercado Envios has already proven to be a transformational service for our
platform, reflected in higher net promoter scores and adoption rates. Our managed network takes on over 90%
of volumes in our region, but there is still room to keep investing in the next phase of deployment of these
services. Logistics is as much an operational efficiency business, through the scaling process, as it is a
technology business. The future waves of improvements in logistics will not come from the sheer scale of the
volume growth. The key to unlocking faster shipping times at a competitive cost will be the deployment of
more tech product features that integrate our logistics partners into our network and within our warehouse
operations.

In Q1’22, almost 55% of shipments were delivered on the same or the next day of purchase, achieving record
average shipping times in Mexico and Chile. Regarding transportation costs, we have been able to offset cost
pressures from rising fuel prices with the deployment of cost-efficient approaches to inbound logistics and last-
mile deliveries. MELI Places is a significant contributor to our efficient delivery operation with over 5800 active
stores enabled in Latin America. We are focused on accelerating the deployment of pick-up and return
functions to these locations, offering a convenient and safe alternative for buyers to handle purchases.

                 Fulfillment sustained nearly 40% penetration of volumes in the first quarter, even after the peak
shopping season in the fourth quarter when fulfillment inventory runs high with first-party volumes. Items
fulfilled by Mercado Libre have the fastest shipping on our network. Sellers on fulfillment typically enter a
virtuous cycle of improving their sales conversion rates due to the better delivery promises, and over time
become better evaluated and ranked on our platform. As a result, we began charging merchants for fulfillment
storage fees upon inbounding the inventory, initially testing our pricing power for this service. We were
encouraged by some of our initial readings on inventory quality and depth, especially in Mexico which is our
most mature market in fulfillment penetration.

                  Our investments to grow the commerce business are balanced between developing the
current business and scaling new opportunities for categories we are developing, such as groceries and our
first-party assortment. Structurally, we believe that our infrastructure for logistics, customer service, fraud
prevention and traffic generation with high-frequency users will be key in leading the transition of long-tail
categories into online supply. We will continue to invest in these key pieces as we transform our user
experience and merchant tools to keep amplifying our assortment with a high-quality experience.
                                                   Fintech

                 We had strong results across the board for payments and credit, generating record levels in
revenues for fintech.

                 Starting with the Credit business, we kept our trajectory of profitably growing our portfolio and
within the expected levels of loan defaults. The first quarter closed with a portfolio of $2.4 billion dollars, of
which about 53% were consumer loans and 19% was the credit card book. The expansion of the total loan
book, up from $1.7 billion dollars at the close of 2021, was driven mostly by those two products as we are
originating more personal loans on the Mercado Pago app and ramping up the credit card offering. This
quarter, we also launched our first credit operation in Chile with a merchant loan book.

                  The non performing loans (NPLs) on each individual book are generally stable compared to our
historical averages. However, between the accelerated pace of originations in the fourth quarter and the mix
shift into a higher exposure to consumer credit, total NPLs as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio is
nearly 27.6%, up 330 basis points from the seasonably low rates in the fourth quarter, and are comparable to
levels from the second and third quarter of 2021. Importantly, while the NPLs grew on aggregate, they are also
reflective of the growth in books with the higher spreads, and the scaling of our still nascent credit card
business. The increase in NPLs does not change the course of direction on the profitability of our interest-
bearing loans, which have sustained its profit margins in this fast-growth scenario. We are operating credit
originations diligently to determine the speed at which we can continue growing without running into structural
adverse selection or higher risk exposure.

We hold a foundational belief that a healthy credit book drives growth throughout our entire ecosystem. A
thriving financing business:

• Boosts on-platform conversion.
• Facilitates adoption of more payments in the digital wallet.
• Helps our merchants access more working capital to invest in expansion.

                    We aim to keep placing new distribution channels and loan products to reach our users and
facilitate their financial lives. The most recent service launch was to add an option for consumers to hire credit
loans at the moment of making a PIX payment through their digital wallets in Brazil. Until now, PIX has been a
payment rail mostly substituting cash transactions in the market. Moving forward, we imagine that it could be
the channel for overlaying other financing features over a less expensive transactional rail. With that in mind, in
the first quarter, we launched our first consumer credit product iteration on PIX, addressing our users' need to
make immediate payments when they do not have cash stored in their wallets. With a few clicks, pre-scored
Mercado Pago users can opt to make that payment by accessing funds through Mercado Credito and bear the
cost of that interest, while the merchants receive the payment at sight. We believe that there is room for more
innovation in credit and payments solutions in Latin America, and that we are well-positioned to be leaders in
that transformation.

                Our payments processing and acquiring business also continues to thrive. Acquiring TPV
reached $17.4 billion dollars in the quarter, growing 46% on a USD basis and over 52% on an FX-neutral basis,
driven mostly by off-platform payments. Even with the tough comps of last year’s first quarter, Online Payments
TPV and MPOS TPV accelerated sequentially, growing 54% and 72% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. The
growth leader is the QR network, which more than doubled TPV year-over-year, with important growth coming
from both Argentina and Brazil.
                  After adjusting the financing fees to reflect higher interest rates for off-platform transactions,
we note a return to similar financing and transactional net take rate levels from last year, offsetting most of the
cost pressure observed up to now. We have also diversified our funding approach, reducing our coupon
discounting operation in the first quarter and partially financing the prepayment of credit card receivables to
our merchants through the issuance of bank certificates of deposits in Brazil. We have not observed signs of
merchant churn thus far after implementing the new pricing. For the installments with interest, there are some
indications of buyers showing lower adoption rates for paying in installments at these higher rates. All in all, net
take rates for the acquiring business are on the right path of balancing cost pressures while sustaining strong
volume growth.
                  With respect to Digital Account, we were pleased to see that volumes and engagement
continue to soar. TPV for Digital Account was $7.9 billion dollars, growing about 178% on a USD basis and 180%
on an FX-neutral basis. Unique fintech active users reached 35.8 million in the quarter, with higher engagement
on wallet transactions and more users taking on credit lines with us. There were almost 23 million users with
active asset management accounts in the first quarter, and over one million users buying or selling
cryptocurrencies through our digital wallet. We are excited about the role we are playing to create a friendly
user interface for crypto in Latin America with this first product launch - nearly 80% of the crypto wallet users
are accessing cryptocurrencies for the first time ever. Our fintech services are expanding well beyond
payments and we are increasingly able to offer a greater breadth of solutions, paving the way towards the
principality of user accounts as we deepen our relationship with them.



                                             Financial Results

               We achieved record net revenues in the quarter, with $2.2 billion dollars, at a growth rate of
63% on a USD basis and of over 67% on an FX-neutral basis. Along with the sustained transaction growth in
gross merchandise volume and total payment volume in the first quarter driving higher revenues, both our
commerce and fintech businesses have improved monetization levels year-over-year. The additional services
we provide throughout the ecosystem, like advertising, shipping and credit, are boosting revenue growth
beyond the fees charged for sales transactions, and these services are key to deepening our relationship with
merchants and users on our platform. In Q1, advertising revenues were nearly 1.1% of our GMV, shipping net
revenues almost tripled year-over-year, and revenues from our credit business surpassed the $400 million-
dollar mark.

                In the first quarter, we also had a significant year-over-year improvement in gross profit
margins, reaching 47.7% with a gross profit record of almost $1.1 billion dollars. Our strong top-line growth
creates scale in our business, with operational leverage on our cost base that sustains commerce and
payments operations. Shipping costs as a percentage of total revenues continues to decline, even in the first
quarter which has a seasonally higher shipping unit cost due to lower volume compared to the previous fourth
quarter.

                   Consolidated operating expenses represented 41.5% of revenues, up from 36.3% in the first
quarter of 2021. The main driver of the higher expense rate was an increase in bad debt provisions related to
the high levels of originations from our credit book and, more importantly, the ramp-up of our credit card
offering. This is the first year of operations for the credit card and, by accounting rules, will increase our bad
debt provision in this phase of the rollout for this nascent piece of the business. We track the performance of
these early cohorts closely and are comfortable with their performance for now. Isolating the credit card effect
in the first quarter, the interest-bearing credit books remain profitable, in line with previous quarters.
                  Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding bad debt charges, were
similar to the first quarter of 2021, with 30.2% compared to 30.1%. Removing the bad debt effect, sales and
marketing expenses represented 12.8% of revenues, and we have delivered operational leverage year-over-
year on these expenses as we continue to invest efficiently in customer acquisition and branding initiatives.
Additionally, with our commitment to constructing leading user experiences through innovation and
technology, we continue to invest in the expansion of our team. This includes software engineers and product
developers in accordance with our annual hiring plan. As a result, we are increasing the spend as a percentage
of revenues for general and administrative expenses and product development expenses.

                With that, our operating margin for the quarter reached 6.2%, with $139 million dollars, slightly
lower than the 6.6% margin from last year’s first quarter, and up $48 million from the total $91 million dollars in
income from operations in the first quarter of 2021.

                 The foreign currency losses in the quarter were only three million dollars. From time to time,
the Company acquires shares of its own common stock in the Argentine market and pays for them in Argentine
pesos at a price that reflects the additional cost of accessing US dollars through an indirect mechanism,
because of restrictions imposed by the Argentine government for buying US dollars at the official exchange
rate in Argentina. This loss was partially offset by Brazilian Real appreciation during the first quarter of 2022.

               Interest expenses were 2.5% of net revenues, similar to the prior quarters, yet lower than the
6.6% spent in Q1 of last year with the loss on debt extinguishment related to the convertible 2028 Notes
repurchase.

              Finally, we delivered a net income of $65 million dollars, at a 2.9% margin, a significant
improvement compared to the net loss incurred last year.



                                Progressing Our Mission in 2022

                 Similar to the trend of the last couple of years, there is macroeconomic and sociopolitical
uncertainty in Latin America as we look to the near future. Given this uncertainty, we will continue to invest for
growth in our core business as well as in the continuous launches of new features and services that expand our
ecosystem. To develop more products and accelerate our ability to deploy them, we are also investing in the
growth of our team, and we aim to onboard nearly 14,000 new employees this year.

                 We are confident that we are progressing our mission to democratize access to commerce and
financial services throughout Latin America. We are off to a strong start in terms of execution and results this
year, and we will continue to grow while remaining focused on our priorities and conscious of our path towards
improvements in operating efficiency.

                On behalf of our management team, we appreciate the continued interest of our investors and
stakeholders in tracking our developments and are looking forward to providing more updates on our
performance in future quarters. The best is yet to come.

                                  Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
present foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP
financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure can be found in the tables below.

This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure
should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measures.

We provide this non-GAAP financial measure to enhance overall understanding of our current financial
performance and its prospects for the future, and we understand that this measure provides useful information
to both Management and investors. In particular, we believe that FX neutral measures provide useful
information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that
may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
2021 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2022, so as to calculate what our results would have
been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
three-months period ended March 31, 2022:
