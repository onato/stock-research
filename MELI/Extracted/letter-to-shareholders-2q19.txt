        SECOND QUARTER 2019 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS1


 Total payment volume through Mercado Pago surpassed $6.5 billion for the first time, reaching $6.52 billion, a year-over-year
  increase of 47.2% in USD and 90.3% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 112.5% year-over-year, totaling
  181.6 million transactions for the quarter.

 Mercado Pago delivered successful execution in off-platform payments (online and offline) through merchant services, mobile point-
  of-sale (“MPOS”) devices and its mobile wallet business. On a consolidated basis, off-platform total payment volume grew 121.5%
  year-over-year in USD and 197.5% on an FX neutral basis.

 For the first time ever, off-platform payments processed almost $3.2 billion in transactions, surpassing 120.0 million payment
  transactions in a single quarter with 120.1 million payments. Off-platform reached an important milestone in June, as it was the first
  month in our history that off platform TPV surpassed on platform TPV.

 Our MPOS business continues to be one of the fastest growing non-marketplace business units, representing 41.9% of total off-
  platform payment volume during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, MPOS total payment volume grew 172.2% year-over-year on
  an FX neutral basis.

 Mobile wallet reached 4.5 million active payers during the quarter, while total payment volume from mobile wallet in Argentina, Brazil
  and Mexico are all growing by triple digits year-over-year.

 Our asset management product, Mercado Fondo, is available in Argentina and Brazil, where we offer our entire suite of FinTech
  solutions: MPOS devices, QR code in-store payments, mobile wallet and asset management. Mercado Fondo has invested over
  70% and 50% of customer funds in Mercado Pago in Brazil and Argentina, respectively.

 Gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) increased surpassing again $3 billion mark reaching $3.4 billion, representing an 8.4% and
  33.0% increase in USD and on an FX neutral basis, respectively.

 Items sold reached 88.7 million, growing 3.8% year-over-year versus 38.8% during the same period last year. The decrease in
  growth rates year-over-year is attributable to Brazil, where in July of last year we launched the R$5 flat listing fee on items below R$
  120 and removed listings below R$ 6 as we shift towards incentivizing buyers to purchase higher ticket items, as well as the
  implementation of the same initiative in Argentina during the second quarter of 2019.

 Unique buyers numbers continue to accelerate versus the prior quarter, growing 20.8% year-over-year versus 10.8% in the first
  quarter.

 Live listings offered on MercadoLibre’s marketplace surpassed 200 million for the second time, reaching 224.1 million in the second
  quarter of 2019, a 50.6% year-over-year increase.

 Mobile gross merchandise volume grew 23.5% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis reaching 59.6% of GMV.

 Items shipped through Mercado Envios reached 70.2 million, a 33.0% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by optimizations in
  our free shipping program.

 Interest income was $33.7 million, a 239.7% increase year-over-year, as a result of the proceeds of the 2028 Convertible Notes and

  in Argentina.
 The Company incurred $14.7 million in financial expenses in the second quarter of 2019, mainly attributable to interest expense
  related to the 2028 Convertible Notes.
 Foreign exchange gain for the second quarter of 2019 was $0.8 million, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Brazilian

 Net income before taxes was $7.3 million, up from a loss of $19.0 million during the second quarter 2018.

         NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


     To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
     measures.

     This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
     with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not
     based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of
     the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure
     should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

     Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables
     included in this quarterly report.

     The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an
     overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP
     measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may
     not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

     The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2018 and applying them
     to the corresponding months in 2019, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from
     one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include anyother
     macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to
     compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.




            The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations
            for the three-month period ended June 30, 2019:
