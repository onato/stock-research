                       Letter to Shareholders

       MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; August 4, 2025 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin
America’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.


               Net revenues & financial income of $6,790 million, up 34% YoY and 53% FX-neutral
                              Income from operations of $825 million, with a 12.2% margin
                                          Net income of $523 million, with a 7.7% margin
                        $64.6 billion Total Payment Volume, up 39% YoY and 61% FX-neutral
                     $15.3 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 21% YoY and 37% FX-neutral


To our Shareholders

Mercado Libre delivered another strong quarter in Q2'25 with net revenues & financial income growing 34% YoY and maintaining
its high pace of expansion. We are encouraged by the progress we are making towards our long-term goals of being the
destination of choice for online commerce in Latin America, becoming the region's largest fintech and building the best value
proposition for advertisers in branding and search. We took bold steps on all three fronts this quarter. These actions will help us to
build greater scale and further enhance customer experience and satisfaction. We are pleased with the business’ performance and
remain confident in Mercado Libre's long-term growth potential.



Commerce

Free shipping remains one of our most effective tools for bringing offline retail online and extending our position as Latin America's
largest ecommerce platform. For nearly a decade, we have offered free shipping on a large portion of our business, so we know it is
a crucial driver of conversion, retention and customer satisfaction. With this in mind, we significantly strengthened our value
proposition in June by expanding our free shipping offer in Brazil to include millions of items from R$19 for all buyers (R$79
previously). We also reduced shipping charges for sellers in the R$79-200 range. Together, these changes are broadening and
deepening our marketplace assortment, boosting engagement among existing users and attracting new buyers. At the same time,
our new AI-powered search experience - with infinite scroll - is increasing navigation time in key categories where we expect these
shipping enhancements to have the greatest impact.

Initial results have been encouraging, with items sold growth in Brazil accelerating to 34% YoY in June and reaching 26% YoY in
Q2'25, despite a tougher base of comparison than Q1. Brazil GMV followed a similar pattern with strong FX-neutral growth of 29%
YoY in the quarter. FX-neutral GMV growth in Brazil has now remained above or close to 30% YoY for eight consecutive quarters –
a testament to the strength of our momentum.

We have built the fastest shipping network in Latin America since launching our managed network in 2017. This speed is powered
by more than 30 fulfillment centers, which handled 57% of shipments across the region in Q2'25. We are committed to maintaining
our competitive advantage in speed as we are convinced that fast delivery will always be in high demand. In fact, we still see solid
demand for fast (paid) shipping on purchases below R$79 in Brazil despite the introduction of free (slower) shipping in this price
range. Those opting for free shipping below R$79 are served with a slower, lower cost layer of our network that leverages existing
infrastructure. We have operated this layer with limited volume for 18 months and are now scaling rapidly. Over time, we expect unit
costs to fall and slow delivery promises to improve as we innovate, deploy technology and drive more volume through the network.

Argentina had another exceptional quarter in Q2'25. Unique buyer growth exceeded 30% YoY for the second consecutive quarter
– underscoring the attractiveness of our value proposition versus physical retail in Argentina as the economy stabilizes, confidence
returns and consumption strengthens. Items sold rose 46% YoY, showing robust growth versus Q2'24, which was the point at which
momentum in Argentina started to accelerate after a tough start to the year. This supported FX-neutral GMV growth of 75% YoY in

Q2’25. Growth was broad-based and driven by multiple factors: a higher mix of premium take rate transactions (which offers
interest-free installments to buyers), incremental installments funded by Mercado Libre, the launch of MELI+ and a 6ppt YoY
increase in fulfillment penetration. This led to a record level of same day deliveries in Argentina.

Mexico delivered an excellent performance in Q2'25. Items sold grew 36% YoY - the fastest pace in nearly two years - driving FX-
neutral GMV growth to accelerate to 32% YoY. Our ongoing investment in logistics continues to yield good results. Fulfillment
penetration in Mexico exceeded 75% for the first time, supported by the opening of new facilities that expanded capacity available
to sellers. As a result, the proportion of same- and next-day deliveries rose sequentially in Q2'25 and improved YoY after falling
slightly in Q1'25. Cross-border GMV growth accelerated following the roll-out of a range of initiatives in Q1'25 designed to improve
competitiveness. Pricing and financing were sharper across the site in Q2'25, while assortment improvements further strengthened
our value proposition. Executing well on these efforts reversed the specific weaknesses in consumer electronics that we highlighted
in Q1’25, and drove a substantial acceleration in first-party (1P) growth in Mexico.

Our 1P business continues to scale rapidly across the region. Quarterly GMV surpassed $1bn for the first time in Q2'25 after growing
103% YoY on an FX-neutral basis. This rapid scaling is an indicator of the strength of our value proposition and the strategic
importance of 1P as a tool to fill gaps in our assortment or price competitiveness. This is enabling us to expand share in categories
such as consumer electronics, where we have historically been underweighted. We continue to deploy technology to manage all
aspects of the business, gain scale with suppliers, and increase advertising revenue.

Our integration with Google Ad Manager and AdMob went live in April. This is an important milestone as we seek to build the best
value proposition for advertisers in branding as well as search. This integration expands our reach beyond Mercado Libre's
ecosystem. Advertisers can now seamlessly manage campaigns that simultaneously target consumers both inside and outside our
ecosystem. Advertisers can leverage our rich first-party data and we can provide attribution for branding campaigns. These are
unique capabilities that are core to our vision of Mercado Ads as a major media company in Latin America with a compelling full-
funnel offer for advertisers of all shapes and sizes.

In Q2'25, advertising revenue growth accelerated to 38% YoY and 59% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth in search remains resilient,
while Display & Video revenue almost doubled YoY, albeit still from a low base. All countries posted solid growth as revenue
relative to GMV rose across-the-board, with Argentina narrowing the gap with Brazil and Mexico.



Fintech Services

We are excited about the trends we are seeing in Fintech Services. We have worked hard for years to build a value proposition with
exceptional customer satisfaction and user experience. Leading net promoter scores (NPS) in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile
show that this is already a reality. So too does the growth in our user base, which has doubled over the last two and a half years to
reach almost 68mn MAUs in Q2'25 (+30% YoY). The average number of products per user in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina has risen
by approximately 50% over the same two and a half year period, and the proportion of high frequency users continues to rise
consistently across-the-board. In other words: engagement is strengthening. This is the context in which we launched bold
marketing campaigns in Brazil, Mexico and Chile in Q2'25 with the objective of significantly expanding Mercado Pago's reach
beyond its current 68mn MAUs.

Our yielding account and savings products were central elements of these marketing campaigns. We are convinced that offering
attractive yields on funds held in Mercado Pago accounts is great for consumers and a powerful engagement tool. It is the Fintech
equivalent of free shipping, which reduces friction for people to come to our platform. This strategy has enabled us to build the
largest retail money market fund in Argentina. It is helping us attract funds in Brazil, where we see a huge opportunity in the $180bn
held in “poupança” savings accounts. These accounts pay approximately 65% of the benchmark rate vs. 100% to 120% at Mercado
Pago. In Mexico, this strategy is helping to digitalize payments in an economy where a major portion of consumption is still handled
in physical currency. As a result, we saw the largest ever QoQ nominal increase in AUM in Brazil, Mexico and Chile in Q2'25, with
the total more than doubling YoY to $13.8bn.

Mercado Pago's credit card performed strongly in Q2'25, with the portfolio growing 118% YoY to $4.0bn. We continue to see steady
progress towards profitability across cohorts. In Brazil, our entire 2023 cohort is now NIMAL positive, which is consistent with prior
cohorts that typically reached this milestone within two years. Together, these cohorts represent 51% of our credit card portfolio in
Brazil, and are now being followed into profitability by our 2024 cohort – the biggest cohort yet. As more cohorts reach profitability,
our ability to offset the dilutive impact of new, initially unprofitable cohorts continues to improve. This trend enabled the credit card
to achieve NIMAL breakeven in Q2'25 – even as we accelerated new card issuance to more than 1.5mn cards in the quarter.

The credit card was the primary driver of 91% YoY growth in the total credit portfolio in Q2'25. It now represents 43% of our $9.3bn
book, up from 37% in Q2'24. Brazil's credit card led the portfolio's sequential growth, with additional strength in the country's
merchant and consumer books. In Mexico, both consumer and credit card portfolios posted their largest ever QoQ increase in
nominal terms. This strong growth was accompanied by solid spreads and healthy asset quality. NIMAL of 23% was broadly stable
QoQ as the unwinding of negative Q1 seasonality was offset by credit card mix and moves upmarket. Our 15-90 day NPL ratio
improved to 6.7%, with sequential improvements across all major countries and products. We are encouraged by these trends,
which reflect our strategy of growth with risk management as the top priority.


Acquiring

We continued to gain market share across all major geographies in Q2'25 with Acquiring TPV growth of 53% YoY on an FX-neutral
basis. Our ability to offer multiple products and serve merchants with a single point of contact is proving to be attractive for large
merchants in Argentina. This move upmarket has been a key driver of TPV growth well ahead of inflation. In Chile, processing times
improved as we continued migrating devices from Redelcom to Mercado Pago, contributing to acceleration of growth in Q2'25. In
Brazil, our Instore segment delivered its highest FX-neutral TPV growth since Q1'23 as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus
on attracting high quality TPV. In Mexico, we introduced new features that enable merchants to accept bill payments (such as cable
TV), driving traffic to their stores and enhancing our cash network. We also enabled a dynamic currency conversion feature that
enables merchants to display payment amounts in US dollars as well as Mexican pesos. This adds flexibility and creates
monetization opportunities for Mercado Pago.

Operating efficiently remains a top priority. We have integrated our AI platform, Verdi, into our CRM tool to enhance the productivity
of our commercial teams, resulting in faster activation and higher TPV per new merchant. We have also deployed Verdi to support
online payments merchants with their technical integrations with Mercado Pago and to assist instore merchants facing device
issues. This has enabled more autonomous problem resolution and significantly reduced the number of device replacements.


Consolidated Financial Results

Net revenues & financial income sustained its rapid pace of growth in Q2'25, rising 34% YoY to $6.8bn. This is consistent with
performance in recent quarters, despite lapping shipping reporting updates, incremental investment in free shipping and reduced
shipping charges for sellers. Consolidated FX-neutral revenue growth of 53% YoY moderated versus previous quarters due to
slowing inflation in Argentina, which is beneficial for our business, consumers, and the broader economy. This revenue growth was
supported by strong FX-neutral trends in both Commerce (+45% YoY) and Fintech (+63%).

We are investing to capture the many growth opportunities ahead, while maintaining our commitment to doing so profitably and
sustainably. In Q2'25, we believe we struck a good balance: income from operations grew 14% YoY to $825mn while the margin
contracted by 210bps YoY. This compression was primarily driven growth investments. Forgone revenue from incremental free
shipping and seller shipping discounts (implemented in June) flows directly through to the income from operations line. Additionally,
we saw a negative mix impact from 1P this quarter, and marketing spend also increased to support our free shipping and Mercado
Pago campaigns. We are confident these are the right investments to make for the benefit of our users and our ecosystem as, over
time, they stimulates engagement with our marketplace, and potential fintech and advertising cross-sells. While provisions
increased as a percentage of consolidated revenue - as credit grew faster than the business overall - the credit business was a net
positive for YoY margin evolution overall. On the positive side, we are pleased to have diluted G&A and Product Development
expenses once again.

Net income of $523mn was down slightly YoY due to higher FX losses and normalization of our tax rate in Q2'25. FX losses of
$117mn doubled YoY, mainly due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso in April. This led to larger FX losses compared to
previous devaluations because our net asset position in the country has grown as the economy has stabilized. The effective tax rate
was higher YoY because deductions related to tax inflation adjustments significantly reduced taxable income in Argentina in 2024.

Adjusted free cash flow reached $454mn in Q2'25 after capex of $287mn and $816mn net investment in Fintech funding, most of
which was directed to growing our credit portfolio. We also discounted fewer receivables in Brazil, as we used lower-cost funding
alternatives. In July, S&P recognized the strength of our business and finances by upgrading Mercado Libre to investment grade
with a rating of BBB-. This milestone reflects the importance we place on maintaining a strong balance sheet to support our long-
term growth ambitions. It comes after last year's upgrade to investment grade at Fitch.


Looking ahead

In May, we announced that our Founder and CEO, Marcos Galperin, would transition to the role of Executive Chairman as of January
1, 2026. Ariel Szarfsztejn, President of Commerce, will take on the role of CEO. Investors can learn more about the transition in the
latest episode of our IR podcast and in Marcos’ Open Letter to Employees, both available on our Investor Relations website.

This is a significant moment in our 26-year history, but also a moment marked by continuity. Continuity in our mission to
democratize commerce and financial services in Latin America, continuity in our long-term strategy of sustainable growth, and
continuity in our culture of entrepreneurship, innovation, ambition and excellence. Above all, continuity in our belief that the best is
yet to come.

(1) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts. Growth calculations based on this table may not total due to rounding. As of December 31, 2024, we decided no longer disclose
the key performance indicator "Number of items shipped". Management believes that "Number of items shipped", as a complementary disclosure to "items sold", no longer provides useful
information to investors to better understand our business. Following years of investment, our logistics network now ships 95% of items sold. As such, the two performance metrics,
"Number of items sold" and "Number of items shipped", have converged so we no longer see a benefit for investors in disclosing both.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency
losses, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets as non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be
found in the tables below.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP
measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that
they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These
non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measures.

We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an
overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of depreciation
and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency
losses, net and income tax expense. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to
evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we
believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in
the same manner as our Management. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as
it removes the effect of certain items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial liabilities and current and
non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents restricted due to
management restriction policies) and digital assets, short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and
foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.
We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios
and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash flows and income
statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other market participants in showing
the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our
leverage based on widely-used measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

FX neutral

We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign
currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2024 and applying
them to the corresponding months in 2025, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained
stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not
include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price
adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month period
ended June 30, 2025:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets

Adjusted free cash flow

Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and
investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at cost,
investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on
loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital
of the Fintech activities. As of June 30, 2025 we have also included increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and
investments restricted due to management restriction policies and digital assets as an adjustment in the calculation of our adjusted
free cash flow. We consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to
management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that can be used for
discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the utility of adjusted free cash flow as a
measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the total increase or decrease in our available cash,
investments and digital assets balance for the period. Therefore, we believe it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow
measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets

Net increase (decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets (effective June 30, 2025, our available funds include digital
asset holdings) represents adjusted free cash flow less net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities,
related to our Commerce and corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities
not considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider Net increase
(decrease) in available cash, investments and digital assets to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides useful information
to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and activities from the adjusted free cash
flow.
