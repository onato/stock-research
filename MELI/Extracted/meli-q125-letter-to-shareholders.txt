        MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; May 7, 2025 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America’s
leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the first-quarter ended March 31, 2025.


                 Net revenues & financial income of $5.9 billion, up 37% YoY and 64% FX-neutral
                              Income from operations of $763 million, with a 12.9% margin
                                          Net income of $494 million, with a 8.3% margin
                        $58.3 billion Total Payment Volume, up 43% YoY and 72% FX-neutral
                      $13.3 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 17% YoY and 40% FX-neutral


To our Shareholders

We have had a strong start to the year at Mercado Libre, sustaining the momentum built up through 2024. Growth continues to be
outstanding across the business, with KPIs supported by strong execution and an intense focus on offering a value proposition to
our users that is constantly improving and innovative. This has translated to solid net revenues and financial income growth of 37%
YoY in Q1'25. Argentina performed exceptionally well, with last year's recovery in demand strengthening even further. This helped
counterbalance increased investment in Brazil and Mexico and, as a result, income from operations grew 45% YoY to $763mn in
Q1'25. This reflects our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth as we continue to pursue the many growth opportunities
ahead of us.



Commerce

Taking share from physical stores, which still account for approximately 85% of retail spend in Latin America, is one of the largest of
these opportunities. We have less than 5% share of the region's total retail market. Continuing to invest in our value proposition to
make the online buying experience more attractive than offline is the best way to increase our share. These investments have
contributed to consistent improvements in our brand preference scores, which reached all-time highs in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina
and Chile in Q1'25. This is one of the drivers of strong unique active buyer trends in recent quarters, which continued in Q1'25 with
fantastic growth of 25% YoY.

The increase in unique active buyers was the primary driver of FX-neutral GMV growth of 30% YoY in Brazil and 23% YoY in Mexico
in Q1'25. We continue to grow ahead of the market in both countries despite intense competition. Growth in Mexico slowed due to
weaker sales trends in one high ASP category early in the quarter, which is being addressed with several targeted initiatives.
Argentina delivered FX-neutral GMV growth of 126% YoY and sold items growth of 52% YoY in Q1'25. This tremendous
performance reflects the strength of our brand and value proposition in a stabilizing macro environment. It is particularly pleasing to
see the consistency of growth across categories in Argentina, with the supermarket category being a highlight.

At a regional level, supermarket items sold grew 65% YoY in Q1'25, faster than all other categories and accelerating sequentially.
We have spent several quarters focusing on improvements to the user experience (UX), including a repeat purchase feature (which
has increased recurrence), better navigation (category aisles, for example) and new ad placements. These UX enhancements have
enabled us to be bolder in our initiatives to generate new demand. As we scale the supermarket category, its positive downstream
impacts, such as more frequent purchasing in general merchandise, are expanding. This is important to our long-term ambition of
increasing overall purchase frequency.

Our logistics network is critical to our long-term growth ambitions. Having the fastest network is - and will continue to be, in our view
- one of the most potent tools to bring offline retail online. At the same time, having a low cost network to sustainably serve low
ASPs is important to increasing purchase frequency. This is why we are making our network more flexible, so we are able to offer
slower options while also having the fastest options in the market. In fulfillment - which surpassed 60% penetration in Brazil for the

first time in March - our growing scale and sharp focus on efficiency and productivity initiatives are reducing costs. This was evident
in Q1'25 with total cost per fulfillment order declining YoY in local currency in Brazil, Mexico and Chile. This enables us to invest
more in strategic initiatives, such as free shipping.

We took another important step in expanding our advertising inventory beyond our marketplace by launching the Mercado Play app
on TVs at the end of Q1'25. The app is now available to download on more than 70mn smart TVs across the region. Mercado Play
has more than 15,000 hours of free content available to anyone using one of our apps. In a region where less than half of the
population pays for a streaming subscription, this is potentially a large win-win-win opportunity for consumers, content studios and
Mercado Ads.

Advertising revenue grew 50% YoY on an FX-neutral basis in Q1'25. We are pleased that the share of Display within our Ads
revenue rose by almost 10ppts YoY. We are still at a very early stage in our long-term plans for Display and Video, which present us
with great opportunities. The breadth and depth of our first-party data is a unique asset and major competitive advantage. We are
confident that this is a strong foundation for our long-term ambition of becoming a much larger player in Latin America's digital
advertising market, where our current market share is low.



Fintech Services

We are successfully scaling our digital account after years of work to build a competitive product stack and user experience. The
continued growth of MAUs at startup rates reflects this. In Q1'25, we reached 64mn MAUs, growing 31% YoY, with Brazil, Mexico
and Chile all advancing faster than the total. Consistent improvements in NPS, particularly in Brazil and Mexico, give us confidence
that we have the value proposition in place to build a much larger user base in the coming years.

Giving our users a yield on deposits that broadly matches or exceeds benchmark rates from day one with immediate liquidity is at
the core of that value proposition. It is also disruptive in an environment where incumbent banks continue to hold the vast majority
of deposits at inferior yields. Our low cost-to-serve enables us to offer these yields at scale while growing profitably. Moreover, this
strategy is driving positive externalities across the ecosystem. Users that bring funds to Mercado Pago are stickier, engage more
with other products in the digital account and purchase more frequently on the marketplace. This is the power of our ecosystem in
action.

Our credit products are also at the core of Mercado Pago's value proposition and are another good example of the power of the
ecosystem. Credit is an attractive profit pool in its own right but its externalities - such as more frequent purchasing on the
marketplace among Mercado Pago credit card holders - means the overall opportunity for Mercado Libre is even more attractive.
Externalities work both ways as we are able to use the ecosystem to create a differentiated offering for users of Mercado Pago's
credit products. This includes access to additional installments on marketplace purchases for credit card holders and more free
shipping for MELI+ subscribers.

We continue to be pleased with the performance of our credit portfolio, which grew 75% YoY to $7.8bn in Q1'25. We have sustained
high growth rates and maintained delinquency at comfortable levels. Growth was outstanding in Brazil, which added more than
$800mn to the portfolio QoQ. First payment defaults on the credit card in Brazil - the largest individual portfolio - reached another
all-time low in March, and the 15-90 day NPL of 8.2% for the portfolio as a whole in Q1'25 remains within the same range as in the
last 12 months. This reflects the attractiveness of our target audience - tens of millions of buyers on the marketplace, many of whom
are creditworthy - and the successful use of data. The portfolio's NIMAL spread contracted to 22.7%, with negative seasonality
being its principal driver QoQ, and a larger share of credit cards (42% in Q1'25 vs. 35% in Q1'24) and the move upmarket explaining
the YoY pressure. Underlying spreads and asset quality metrics remain robust.

Acquiring

Another good example of the ecosystem in action is the cross-sell of Fintech Services products to our Acquiring merchants. This is
gathering pace, with the clearest demonstration being the rising number of merchants that take loans from Mercado Pago. In
addition, the portion of available balances receiving a yield increased substantially in Q1'25 following last year's launch of a new
savings pot for merchants which pays 100% of the benchmark rate in Brazil. All these products within our ecosystem help us to offer
a more compelling and differentiated package of solutions to merchants.

Our main focus in 2025 is to further strengthen this differentiation because it is already supporting strong growth trends. FX-neutral
Acquiring TPV growth in Q1'25 remained close to 30% YoY in Brazil and 50% YoY in Mexico, both for the ninth consecutive quarter.
In Argentina, FX-neutral growth of 144% YoY slowed on an absolute basis as inflation receded, but accelerated sequentially in real
terms (discounting inflation) by 20ppts; USD growth was 93% YoY. This is indicative of the opportunities we still have in Argentina.
For example, we recently revamped our recurring payments product and this has led to new, large merchants across a range of
industries coming to Mercado Pago for the first time. Our market share is rising consistently in all major markets, but from a
relatively low base in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, which gives us plenty of runway to continue to grow.



Consolidated Financial Results

We started the year with strong top line momentum. Net revenues & financial income reached $5.9bn, with growth of 37% YoY in
Q1'25 broadly maintaining 2024's strong trend. On an FX-neutral basis, growth was 64% YoY in Q1'25 with strong performance
across the region. Brazil grew +41% YoY with Mexico +51% YoY and Argentina +184% YoY (all FX-neutral).

Income from operations of $763mn in Q1'25 grew 45% YoY, with the quarter's strong top line trends driving our solid profit growth.
Argentina's impressive revenue growth was a major contributor to this. The recovery of its direct contribution margin against a low
base in Q1'25 helped counterbalance investments and some cost pressures in Brazil and Mexico. Direct contribution fell slightly YoY
in both of these geographies, partly driven by currency depreciation and higher interest rates in Brazil. Strategic investments in
shipping and scaling our credit card also led to short-term pressure on margins. That said, we are pleased that our strategy of
reinvesting for the long-term is clearly strengthening the ecosystem and our competitive position.

Net income reached $494mn in Q1'25, growing 44% YoY. Adjusted free cash flow of -$10mn in Q1’25 was seasonally low and
included investments of $256mn in capex and $770mn in Fintech funding, most of which supported the expansion of our credit
book. Our strong financial results and balance sheet provide us with a robust foundation on which to pursue our ambitious long-
term growth goals.


Looking ahead

We will continue to reinvest in the business to maintain our strong momentum. This will put Mercado Libre in an even better position
to capture the many growth opportunities ahead of us. We will invest with discipline and focus on long-term sustainable growth, as
we always have done. This is a reflection of our great optimism about the opportunities ahead and our ability to capture them. It is
also a tangible demonstration of our firm belief that the best is yet to come.

(1) Figures have been calculated using rounded amounts. Growth calculations based on this table may not total due to rounding. As of December 31, 2024, we decided no longer disclose
the key performance indicator "Number of items shipped". Management believes that "Number of items shipped", as a complementary disclosure to "items sold", no longer provides useful
information to investors to better understand our business. Following years of investment, our logistics network now ships 95% of items sold. As such, the two performance metrics,
"Number of items sold" and "Number of items shipped", have converged so we no longer see a benefit for investors in disclosing both.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency
losses, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments as non-GAAP measures.
Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the
tables below.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP
measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that
they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These
non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measures.

We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an
overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of depreciation
and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency
losses, net and income tax expense. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to
evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we
believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in
the same manner as our Management. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as
it removes the effect of certain items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial liabilities and current and
non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding
time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity
securities held at cost. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our
current leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash
flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other market
participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other
measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

FX neutral

We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign
currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2024 and applying
them to the corresponding months in 2025, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained
stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not
include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price
adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2025:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

Adjusted free cash flow

Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and
investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at cost,
investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on
loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital
of the Fintech activities. We consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful
information to management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that can be
used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the utility of adjusted free cash
flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the total increase or decrease in our available cash
and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a
complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net proceeds from/payments on
loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and corporate activities, payments of finance lease
obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available
cash and investments. We consider Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity
availability that provides useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments
and activities from the adjusted free cash flow.

The following table shows a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase
in available cash and investments:
