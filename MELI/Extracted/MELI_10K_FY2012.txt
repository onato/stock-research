 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and
expectations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and should be evaluated as such. The words anticipate,
believe, expect, intend, plan, estimate, target, project, should, may, could, will and similar words and expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are contained throughout this report, for example in Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations and Business. Forward-looking statements generally relate to information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry
environment, potential growth opportunities and the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. Such forward-looking statements reflect, among other things, our current expectations, plans, projections and strategies, anticipated
financial results, future events and financial trends affecting our business, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and important factors (in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report) that may cause our
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things:   


 

 
 our expectations regarding the continued growth of e-commerce and Internet usage in Latin America; 
 


 

 
 our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies; 
 


 

 
 government regulation;   


 

 
 litigation and legal liability;   


 

 
 systems interruptions or failures;   


 

 
 our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
 


 

 
 consumer trends;   


 

 
 security breaches and illegal uses of our services;   


 

 
 competition;   


 

 
 reliance on third-party service providers;   


 

 
 enforcement of intellectual property rights;   


 

 
 our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase revenues; 
 


 

 
 seasonal fluctuations; and   


 

 
 political, social and economic conditions in Latin America in general, and Venezuela and Argentina in particular, including Venezuelas status as
a highly inflationary economy and the impacts of its exchange rate system as well as the impact of foreign currency restrictions in Argentina.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or predict. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the
impact of all such risk factors on our companys business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future
events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not
guarantees of future performance. They are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from
our expectations and projections. Some of the material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections are described in Item 1A  Risk Factors in Part I of
this report. You should read that information in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II of this report and our audited consolidated
financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of Part II of this report, as well as the factors discussed in the other reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. We note such
information for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not perceive them to be
material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.

 Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake
to update these forward-looking statements except as may be required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC. 
PART I   


ITEM 1.
BUSINESS  MercadoLibre,
Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, us, we, our or the Company) hosts the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America, focused on enabling e-commerce and its related services, and is located at
www.mercadolibre.com . Our services are designed to provide our users with mechanisms for buying, selling, paying for, collecting, generating leads and comparing listings via e-commerce transactions in an effective and efficient
manner. We are market leaders in e-commerce in each of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, based on unique visitors and page views during 2012. Additionally, we operate e-commerce platforms
in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Portugal.  Through our e-commerce platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust
online commerce environment that fosters the development of a large and growing e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 584 million people and one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates globally. We
believe that we offer a technological and commercial solution that addresses the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America. 
We offer our users an eco-system of four related e-commerce services: the MercadoLibre Marketplace, the MercadoPago payments solution,
the MercadoClics advertising program and the MercadoShops on-line stores solution.  The MercadoLibre Marketplace, which we
sometimes refer to as our marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly e-commerce service. This service permits both businesses and individuals to list items and conduct their sales and purchases online in either a
fixed-price or auction-based format. Additionally, through online classified listings, our registered users can list and purchase motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services. Any Internet user can browse through the various products
and services that are listed on our web site and register with MercadoLibre to list, bid for and purchase items and services. 
To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution. MercadoPago is designed to
facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace by providing a mechanism that enables our users to securely, easily and promptly send, receive and finance payments online. 
As a further enhancement to the MercadoLibre Marketplace, in 2009, we launched our MercadoClics program to enable businesses to promote
their products and services on the Internet. Through MercadoClics (our advertising service) users and advertisers are able to place display and/or text advertisements on our web pages in order to promote their brands and offerings. MercadoClics
offers advertisers a cost efficient and automated platform that enables advertisers to acquire traffic through advertisements placed on our platform. Advertisers purchase, on a cost per clicks basis, advertising space that appears around product
search results for specific categories and other pages. These advertising placements are clearly differentiated from product search results and direct traffic both to and off our platform depending on the advertiser. 
To close out our suite of e-commerce services, during 2010 we launched the MercadoShops on-line stores solution. Through MercadoShops
users can set-up, manage and promote their own on-line webstores. These webstores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the other marketplace, payments and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore
or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and value added services on their stores.  History of MercadoLibre 
In March of 1999, Marcos Galperin, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, wrote our business plan while working towards his
masters degree in business administration at Stanford Business School. Shortly thereafter, he began to assemble a team of professionals to implement it. We were incorporated in Delaware in October of 1999.

(*)
The office was closed in 2009. 
Our business is organized using the same technological platform in each country where we operate. However, the site of each country has
its own specific local website which has no interaction with our website in other countries. For example, searches carried out on our Brazilian site show only results of listings uploaded on that particular site and do not show listings from other
countries.  We received two rounds of financing in addition to our initial seed funding. The first round, was carried out in
November of 1999, resulting in proceeds to us of $7.6 million from investors that included J.P. Morgan Partners BHCA L.P., Flatiron Fund entities and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. The second round of financing occurred in May of 2000 and
raised $46.7 million from, among others, Goldman Sachs entities (GS Capital Partners III, L.P., GS Capital Partners III Offshore, L.P. and Goldman Sachs & Co. Verwaltungs GmbH), Capital Riesgo Internet SCR S.A. (CRI Banco Santander Central
Hispano), GE Capital Equity Investments, Inc., J.P. Morgan Partners BHCA L.P. and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst.  In
September 2001, we entered into a strategic alliance with eBay, which became one of our stockholders and started working with us to better serve the Latin American e-commerce community. As part of this strategic alliance, we acquired eBays
Brazilian subsidiary at the time, iBazar, and eBay agreed not to compete with us in the region during the term of the agreement. This agreement also provided us with access to certain know-how and experience, which accelerated aspects of our
development. The agreement governing our strategic alliance with eBay expired on September 24, 2006. Even though eBay is one of our stockholders, since the termination of this agreement, there are no contractual restrictions preventing eBay
from becoming one of our competitors. See Risk FactorsRisks related to our businessWe operate in a highly competitive and evolving market, and therefore face potential reductions in the use of our service. 
In November 2002, we acquired certain key strategic assets of Lokau.com, a competing Brazilian online commerce platform and we
incorporated all registered users of Lokau.com into our platform.  In November 2005, we acquired certain operations of
a regional competitor in e-commerce, DeRemate.com Inc., including all of its operations and the majority of the shares of capital stock of its subsidiaries in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela for an aggregate purchase
price of $12.1 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition increased our user base by approximately 1.3 million confirmed registered users and solidified our market leadership position in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and
Uruguay. We did not acquire DeRemates Argentine and Chilean subsidiaries, which continued to operate under the control of certain previous stockholders of DeRemate.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In August 2007, we completed our initial public offering pursuant to which 2,608,696 shares of common stock were sold by us, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $49.6 million and 13,468,489
shares were sold by certain selling stockholders.  In January 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of Classified Media Group, Inc., or CMG, and its subsidiaries. CMG and its subsidiaries operate an online classified advertisements platform primarily dedicated to the sale of vehicles at www.tucarro.com in Venezuela, Colombia and
Puerto Rico and real estate at www.tuinmueble.com in Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, the United States, Costa Rica and the Canary Islands. On the acquisition date, we paid $19 million subject to certain escrows, which have subsequently been released,
and working capital adjustment clauses.  In September 2008, we acquired the remaining operations of DeRemate.com in
Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia for an aggregate purchase price of $37.6 million and we also purchased certain URLs, domains, trademarks, databases and intellectual property rights from it for $2.4 million, subject to certain set off
rights and working capital adjustment clauses.

 In September 2011, we acquired 60% of outstanding membership interest of Autopark LLC, a
limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware with 100% ownership of AP Clasificados, an online classified advertisements platform in Mexico primarily dedicated to the sale of vehicles at www.autoplaza.com.mx and real estate at
www.homeshop.com.mx. The aggregate purchase price paid in cash was $5.5 million and includes URLs, domain names, trademarks, databases non-compete agreements and intellectual property rights that are used or useful in connection with the online
platforms of the acquired business.  Our strategy  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We seek to serve people in Latin America by offering a collection of e-commerce services that can improve the quality of life of those who use it, while creating significant value for our stockholders. We
serve our buyers by giving them access to a broader and more affordable variety of products and services than those available on other online and offline venues. We serve our sellers by allowing them to reach a larger and more geographically diverse
user base at a lower overall cost and investment than offline venues. At the same time, we provide payment settlement services to facilitate such transactions, and advertising solutions to promote them. More broadly, we strive to turn inefficient
markets into more efficient ones and in that process generate value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we intended to pursue the following strategies:   


 

 
 Continue to grow our business and maintain market leadership. We have focused and intend to continue to focus on growing our business by
strengthening our position as the preferred online marketplace in each of the countries in which we operate. We also intend to grow our business and maintain our leadership by taking advantage of the expanding potential user base that has resulted
from the growth of Internet penetration rates in Latin America. We intend to achieve these goals through organic growth, by entering into new countries and category segments, by launching new transactional business endeavors, and through potential
strategic acquisitions of key businesses and assets.   


 

 
 Increase monetization of our transactions. We have focused and will continue to focus on improving the revenue generation capacity of our
business by implementing initiatives designed to maximize the revenues we receive from transactions on our platform. Some of these initiatives include increasing our fee structure, selling advertising on our platform, offering other e-commerce
services and expanding our paid-for fee-based features.   


 

 
 Take advantage of the natural synergies that exist between our services. We strive to leverage our different businesses to promote
greater cross-usage among the businesses, thereby creating a virtuous ecosystem of e-commerce offerings. We promote the adoption of our MercadoPago payments solution on our marketplace as well as on our MercadoShops solution, to offer our
MercadoClics advertising solutions to users of our marketplace, payments and shops solutions, and to encourage users of any of our services to experiment with the other solutions we offer. 
 


 

 
 Expand into additional transactional service offerings. Our strategic focus is to enable on-line transactions of multiple types of goods
and services throughout Latin America. Consequently, we strive, and will continue to strive, to launch on-line transactional offerings in new product and service categories where we believe business opportunities exist. These new transactional
offerings include, but are not limited to, efforts involving: (a) the offer of additional product categories in our marketplace business, (b) the expansion of our presence in vehicle, real estate and services classifieds, (c) the
penetration of our on-platform payments services and the expansion of our off-platform payments services, (d) the increase of our MercadoClics and on-line advertisement services and (e) the offer of on-line software as e-commerce service
solutions. We believe that a significant portion of our future growth will be derived from these new or expanded product and service launches.   


 

 
 Enhance brand awareness. We believe that enhancing awareness of the MercadoLibre brand is important to achieve our business
objectives. We intend to continue to promote and increase recognition of our brand through a variety of marketing and promotional campaigns. These may include marketing agreements with companies that have a significant online presence and
advertising through traditional media, such as cable television. We may also use leading websites and other media such as affiliate programs, banner advertisements and keyword searches. In addition, we believe that by enhancing our e-commerce
community experience, we promote greater brand awareness through word of mouth.   


 

 
 Focus on user loyalty and web site enhancement. We will continue to focus on increasing purchase frequency and transaction volumes from
our existing users. We intend to do so by maintaining an appealing and convenient platform for e-commerce, improving the functionality of our web site to deliver a more efficient user experience and providing our users with the help of a dedicated
customer support department. We employ a number of programs aimed to foster customer loyalty and repeated purchases, such as our MercadoLider loyalty program for high-volume sellers, our targeted and segmented direct marketing program, and our
MercadoPago special promotions.   


 

 
 Increase operational efficiency. We believe our business model provides us with an opportunity to generate healthy profit margins. We
plan to maximize this potential by achieving economics of scale, maintaining controls on overhead costs and reducing variable costs whenever possible.

 Continue to develop innovative and creative solutions. We intend to continually enhance our e-commerce platform in order to better serve
both individuals and businesses that want to buy or sell goods and services online. We intend to continue investing to develop new tools and technologies that facilitate e-commerce on our platform and improve our users online experience on
MercadoLibre, while addressing the distinctive cultural, geographical and other challenges of online commerce in Latin America.   


 

 
 Serve our dynamic and active user community. We seek to operate MercadoLibre as an open and trusted web-based marketplace where users can
access a broad market of products. We believe in treating our users with respect by applying a consistent set of policies that reinforce good online and offline behavior within our user community. We also seek to offer superior customer care in
order to maintain the loyalty and satisfaction of our active user base.  The MercadoLibre marketplace 
The MercadoLibre marketplace is an Internet-based commerce platform where buyers and sellers can meet, and consummate e-commerce
transactions for a wide range of goods and services. Our platform is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce service which permits both businesses and individuals to list items and conduct their sales and purchases
online in either a fixed-price or auction-based format. The MercadoLibre Marketplace also allows sellers to list motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services on our classified section. Any Internet user can browse through the various
products and services that are listed on our website and register for free with MercadoLibre to list, bid for and purchase items and services. Additionally, sellers and advertisers can purchase, display and link advertising on our websites to
promote their brands, businesses and products. The MercadoLibre Marketplace offers buyers a large selection of new and used items that are often more expensive or otherwise hard to find through traditional offline sellers, such as brick-and-mortar
retail establishments, offline classified advertisements, community bulletin boards, auction houses and flea markets. We believe that the MercadoLibre Marketplace allows sellers to reach a large number of potential buyers more cost-effectively than
through traditional offline commerce channels or other online venues.  During 2012, visitors to our web site were able to
browse an average of over 14.1 million listings daily, organized by country, in over 2,000 different product categories. We believe that we have achieved a critical mass of active buyers, sellers and product listings in most of the countries
where we operate and that our business can be readily scaled to handle increases in our user base and transaction volume. At December 31, 2012, we had over 81.5 million confirmed registered MercadoLibre users, up from 65.8 million at
December 31, 2011. During fiscal year 2012, we had 6.0 million unique sellers, 16.9 million unique buyers and 67.4 million successful items sold as compared to i) 5.0 million unique sellers, 14.1 million unique buyers
and 52.8 million successful items sold at December 31, 2011; and to ii) 3.9 million unique sellers, 11.3 million unique buyers and 39.2 million successful items sold at December 31, 2010. 
The MercadoPago online payments solution  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution. MercadoPago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre
Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments online. MercadoPago enables any user registered with MercadoPago to securely and easily send and receive payments online for
MercadoLibre Marketplace items. MercadoPago is currently available to MercadoLibre users in each of Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">MercadoPago is also available for purchases of goods and services outside the MercadoLibre Marketplace, as an open on-line payment service in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Chile and Colombia. The
off platform service is designed to meet the growing demand for Internet-based payments systems in Latin America. In addition to improve the ease of use and efficiency of payments for purchases made in our marketplace, MercadoPago also allows
payments for transactions that occur outside of our platforms. Users are able to transfer money to other users with MercadoPago accounts and to incorporate MercadoPago as a means of payments on their independent commerce websites. This version of
MercadoPago simplifies the payment of transactions in the MercadoLibre Marketplace achieving higher transaction velocity for most users. Direct payments allow online sellers to use MercadoPago to facilitate checkout and payment processes on their
web site and also enable users to simply transfer money to each other. The direct payments product allows users who are not registered with the MercadoLibre Marketplace to send and receive payments to each other as long as they register with
MercadoPago. Furthermore, direct payment offers online sellers who accept MercadoPago as a mean of payment to integrate MercadoPago with their shopping cart, thereby streamlining the shopping and payment processes. We believe that the ease of use,
safety and efficiency of MercadoPago will allow us to generate additional transactions in the future from web merchants that sell items outside the MercadoLibre Marketplace. We believe that there is a significant business opportunity to increase use
of MercadoPago as a payment mechanism within and outside of the MercadoLibre Marketplace.  During the year ended
December 31, 2012, our on and off-platform users paid approximately $1,786.7 million using MercadoPago, which represented 31.3% of our gross merchandise volume for that year. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our on and off-platform
users paid approximately $1,311.9 million using MercadoPago, which represented 27.2% of our gross merchandise volume for that year. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our users paid approximately $697.5 million using
MercadoPago, which represented 20.5% of our gross merchandise volume for that year.  We seek to increase the adoption and
penetration of MercadoPago among MercadoLibre Marketplace users. In the countries where MercadoPago was available, as of December 31, 2012, approximately 93.0% of the MercadoLibre Marketplaces listings accepted MercadoPago for payments
and 33.4% of our total gross merchandise volume (excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft and real estate) was completed through MercadoPago. Starting in Brazil in January 2010, in Argentina in March 2010, in Mexico in April 2011 and in
Venezuela in July 2012, all paid listings in the MercadoLibre Marketplace (excluding free listings and classifieds) were required to offer MercadoPago.

MercadoShops online stores service  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">MercadoShops is a software-as-a-service, fully hosted online webstore solution. Through MercadoShops users can set-up, manage and promote their own on-line webstores. These webstores are hosted by
MercadoLibre and offer integration with the other marketplace, payments and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and added services on their stores.
 Marketing 
Our marketing strategy is designed to grow our platform by promoting the MercadoLibre brand, attracting new users, and generating more
frequent trading by our existing users. To this end, we employ various means of advertising, including placement in leading portals and networks across the region, our affiliates program, cable and air television, paid and natural positioning in
leading search engines, email marketing, onsite marketing and presence in off-line events. Our investment in online and offline marketing activities was $18.8 million during 2012, $19.9 million during 2011 and $20.2 million during 2010.
 Specifically, we rely mostly on online advertising to promote our brand and attract potential buyers and sellers to our web
site. Our online activities focus on:   


 

 
 Entering into agreements with search platforms, portals, social networks and web sites that we believe can reach our target audience. These agreements
allow us to purchase online advertising positions where we can market ourselves and show relevant promotions to potential and already registered users. 
 


 

 
 Actively managing our MercadoSocios program, an affiliates program that financially rewards site owners for directing to our platform
buyers, sellers and new users who ultimately register with, and conduct transactions through our platform. The MercadoSocios program is available in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. With our MercadoSocios program, any site
or online tool owner can place a link to our web site with a pre-approved creative design that we provide or XML data feeds. If an Internet user clicks on the link, arrives at our web site, registers as a user and completes transactions on our
platform, we compensate the site or tool owner. For each new registered user that completes a transaction on our platform, we pay the site or tool owner that directed the user to us a fee per active registered user and a percentage of the
commissions that such selling user pays us for transactions carried out in the first 30 days after that user registered.   


 

 
 Investing in preferential placement on the most popular search engines in each country where we operate, such as Google and Yahoo Search. We purchase
advertising space next to the results of certain keyword searches related to our activities.   


 

 
 Structuring our web site so that it appears among the top natural results for certain keyword searches. 
Since 2005, we have been running an annual cable television commercial campaign on a regional basis to increase brand awareness and
recognition. We believe that cable television subscribers in Latin America offer an attractive demographic group based on both socio-economic profiling and the high penetration of Internet usage among cable television subscribers. During 2010, our
cable media campaign ran from August to December, and we also ran some spots in Brazil on television to expand coverage. During 2011, our cable media campaign ran from May to December, and we also had offline campaigns on radio, newspaper and
magazines for our classifieds business. During the year 2012, we have not invested in cable television commercial campaign since we were transitioning our marketing and external communication strategies and focused most of our resources to on-line
marketing investments. We expect to keep investing in the future in off-line campaigns to enhance our brand awareness and recognition within the region.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition to online and television advertising, we seek to reinforce our brand and increase transaction levels within the existing MercadoLibre user base through activities such as permission-based
e-mail marketing and special promotions on our web site. We utilize information regarding our users past bids, sales and purchases in order to better target the messages that we communicate through these activities. Additionally, we use street
billboards, radio and magazine ads to promote our vehicles classifieds business.  We also conduct a variety of
initiatives that focus on attracting and training sellers. We organize events such as MercadoLibre Universities and seller meetings in all countries where we have an office. MercadoLibre Universities are full-day sessions of
approximately 100 to 250 new users whom we teach how to buy and sell in our platform. During seller meetings, we teach sellers with high-potential or with MercadoLider status more advanced selling techniques and allow them to discuss issues of
interest with our employees. Additionally, certain seller activities are streamed over the Internet to reach a larger audience than is possible in live meetings.

 The positioning of the MercadoLibre brand among Internet users is one of our key
marketing concerns, and our goal is to position MercadoLibres name and concept as a trustworthy platform in the publics mind. We conduct surveys every year in our key markets to gauge the position of our brand in the minds of consumers.
We consistently appear at the top of these surveys in areas such as consumer recall and preference for e-commerce and online commerce sites. We believe these ratings are the result of the quality of our product and our marketing efforts. 
Product development  At
December 31, 2012, we had 327 employees on our information technology and product development staff, an increase from 292 employees at December 31, 2011. We incurred product development expenses (including salaries) in the amount of
$28.6 million in 2012, $23.3 million in 2011 and $15.9 million in 2010. We also incurred information technology capital expenditures, including software licenses, amounting to $11.2 million in 2012, $8.4 million in 2011 and
$5.0 million in 2010.  We continually work to improve both our MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago platforms so that they
better serve our users needs and work more efficiently. A significant portion of our information technology resources are allocated to these purposes. We strive to maintain the right balance between offering new features and enhancing the
existing functionality and architecture of our software and hardware.  The development of new and improved features usually
begins by listening to suggestions from our community of users. We hold meetings periodically with both, regular and highly active users to obtain feedback regarding our services, suggestions and ideas relating to possible additional features on the
MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago platforms. We also receive suggestions from our chat rooms and bulletin boards. Additionally, we monitor the market for new features, formats and elements that could be adapted to our platforms to improve our
users experience.  We place significant importance on the testing and implementation phase of newly developed features.
After an internal team of testers ensures that new features and upgrades are working properly, we typically involve a select group of users in testing these features before we release them to the general public. Through this process we receive
feedback and suggestions on how to enhance the final details of a feature. Additionally, we typically introduce new features country by country, in order to isolate and resolve any potential problems and subsequently release improved versions to
countries, yet to be introduced to the new features.  The adequate management of the MercadoLibre and MercadoPago software
architecture and hardware requirements is as important as introducing additional and better features for our users. Because our business grows relatively fast, we must ensure that our systems are capable of absorbing this incremental volume.
Therefore, our engineers work to optimize our processes and equipment by designing more effective and efficient ways to run our platforms.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We develop most of our software technology in-house. Since our inception in 1999, we have had a development center in Buenos Aires where we concentrate the majority of our development efforts. In June of
2007, we also launched a second development center in the province of San Luis in Argentina. The center is a collaborative effort with the Technological University of La Punta. In this effort, the University offers us access to dedicated development
facilities and a recruiting base for potential employees. During 2012 we opened our newest development center in Aguada Park, Montevideo, Uruguay, which is dedicated to software development activities. We also have other research and/or development
centers in the U.S. in Palo Alto, California, and in Venezuela.  While we have developed most of our software technology
in-house, we also outsource certain projects to outside developers. We believe that outsourcing the development of these projects allows us to have a greater operating capacity and strengthens our internal know-how by incorporating new expertise to
our business. In addition, our team of developers frequently interacts with technology suppliers and attends technology-related events to familiarize itself with the latest inventions and developments in the field. 
Since 2010, we have been working on a deep technology overhaul that is allowing us to switch from a closed and monolithic system to an
open and decoupled one. We are splitting MercadoLibre into many small cells. A cell is a functional unit with its own team, hardware, data and source code. Cells interact with each other using (Application Programming Interfaces, or
APIs). All the Front-Ends are also being rewritten on top of these APIs. This effort has consumed a large amount of capital, people and management focus, and we intend to keep investing in this area. On October 31, 2012, we opened our platform
to the developers community in a launching event that took place in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We seek to continue spreading the opening of our platform to developers in the other locations in which we operate with the objective of increasing our
ecosystem.  We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add
new features and functionality to our services. The market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and product announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing
customer demands. Accordingly, our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our
service in response to competitive service and product offerings and evolving demands of the marketplace. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could
require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure. See Risk FactorsRisks related to our businessOur future success depends on our ability to expand and adapt our operations to
meet rapidly changing industry and technology standards in a cost-effective and timely manner, and on the continued market acceptance of our products and services.

 Seasonality  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Like most retail businesses, we experience the effects of seasonality in all our operating territories throughout the calendar year. Although much of our seasonality is due to the Christmas holiday
season, the geographic diversity of our operations helps mitigate the seasonality attributed to summer vacation time (i.e. southern and northern hemispheres) and national holidays. 
Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in
transactions before the Christmas season (see Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations  Seasonality for more detail). The first quarter of the year is generally our slowest period. The
months of January, February and March correspond to summer vacation time in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Additionally, the Easter holiday falls in March or April, and Brazil celebrates Carnival for one week in February or March. This
first quarter seasonality is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere, such as Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, the slowest months for which are the summer months of July, August and September. 
Competition  The market
for trading over the Internet is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify even further in the future. Barriers-to-entry for large, established Internet companies are relatively low, and current and new
competitors can launch new sites at relatively low cost using commercially available software. While we are currently the market leaders in a number of the markets in which we operate, we currently or potentially compete with a limited number of
small marketplace operators, such as Mas Oportunidades in Argentina and Rakuten in Brazil. We also compete with businesses that offer business-to-consumer online e-commerce services such as pure play Internet retailer Submarino (a website of B2W
Inc.), or others with a focus on specific vertical categories, such as Netshoes, which focus on sports & apparel. 
There are also a growing number of bricks and mortar retailers who have launched on line offerings such as Americanas (a website of B2W
Inc), Casas Bahia and Falabella, and shopping comparison sites located throughout Latin America such as Buscape and Bondfaro. In the classified advertising market, although no regional competitor exists, local players such as Webmotors, VivaStreet
and Zap have important positions in certain markets.  In addition, we could face competition from a number of large online
communities and services that have expertise in either, developing online commerce, facilitating online interaction, or both. Some of these competitors, such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Facebook currently offer a variety of online services, and
certain of these companies may introduce online commerce to their large user populations. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in online commerce, such as large newspaper or media companies also compete in the online
listing market in Latin America.  In September 2001, we entered into a strategic alliance with eBay, which became one of our
stockholders and started working with us to better serve the Latin American online commerce community. As part of this strategic alliance, we acquired eBays Brazilian subsidiary at the time, iBazar, and eBay agreed not to compete with us in
the region during the term of the agreement. This agreement also provided us with access to certain know-how and experience, which accelerated aspects of our development. The agreement governing our strategic alliance with eBay expired on
September 24, 2006. Even though eBay is one of our stockholders, since the termination of this agreement, there are no contractual restrictions preventing eBay from competing with us. For example, in 2012, eBay acquired Alamaula.com, which is
its classified site and which operates in many of the countries where we operate.  MercadoPago competes with existing online
and offline means of payment businesses, including, among others, banks and other providers of traditional means of payment, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits, international online payments services such
as Paypal and Google Checkout, local online payment services such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and Bcash and PagSeguro in Brazil, money remitters such as Western Union, the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin
America, and offline funding alternatives such as cash deposit and money transfer services. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than MercadoPagos current rates. 
Finally, Amazon started operations in Brazil during 2012 by offering on-line content. We do not compete in this space, however the
consolidation and expansion of their operations in Brazil, could eventually lead to more direct competition.  Intellectual property
 We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as
critical to our future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into
confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors. We have also established non-disclosure agreements with our employees, strategic partners and some suppliers in order to limit access to and disclosure
of our proprietary information.  We pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in each country where we
operate, in the United States and in certain other Latin American countries. Generally, we register the name MercadoLibre, MercadoLivre, MercadoPago and MercadoSocios as well as our handshake logo, and
other names and logos in each country where we operate. As part of our acquisition of DeRemate, we acquired the trademarks of DeRemate throughout the countries where it operated, as well as certain other jurisdictions. As part of our acquisition of
CMG, we acquired the trademarks of CMG throughout the countries where it operated.  Autopark LLC, an entity in which we own a
60% interest and have an option to acquire the remaining 40% ownership interest, has 100% ownership of AP Clasificados which owns trademarks of Autoplaza.com.mx and Homershop.com.mx in Mexico. We expect to acquire the remaining 40% ownership
interest in Autopark in the future.

 We manage operations in the remaining countries remotely from our headquarters in Argentina. 
Our employees in Brazil are represented by an Information Technology Companies Labor Union in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo
(Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Empresas e Cursos de Inform&aacute;tica do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo) and some of our employees in Argentina are represented by the Commercial Labor Union (Sindicato de Empleados de
Comercio). Unions or local regulations in other countries could also require that employees be represented. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and we implement a variety of human resources practices, programs and
policies that are designed to hire, develop, compensate and retain our employees.  We are very proud of our employees and
believe that our team is one of the most important assets of our Company. We believe that our employees are among the most knowledgeable in the Latin American Internet industry, and they have developed a deep understanding of our business and
e-commerce in general. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining outstanding individuals over the years. A significant portion of our personnel has been with the Company for several years, and we strive to obtain more talent by
hiring individuals with an Internet-related background and experience. Similarly, our future success will depend on our ability to continue to attract, develop and retain capable professionals. See Risk factors Risks related to our
business We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us.  In order to
support our Human Resources department, we use SAPs human resources payroll module across our business. We believe this allow us to centralize our employee database and important human resources functions, such as payroll processing, to
improve our controls and reduce certain administrative costs.

 Government regulation  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are subject to a variety of laws, decrees and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in some of the countries where we operate related to e-commerce, data collection,
data protection, privacy, information requirements for Internet providers, taxation (including value added taxes, or VAT, or sales tax collection obligations) obligations to provide information to certain authorities about transactions occurring on
our platforms or about our users, and other legislation which also applies to other companies conducting business in general. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights
and other intellectual property issues, taxation (including the imposition to provide certain information about transactions that occurred in our platforms, or about our users), libel and defamation, obscenity, consumer protection, digital
signatures and personal privacy apply to online businesses. Some of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of legal uncertainty,
and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These regulations could cover a wide variety of
issues, including, without limitation, online commerce, Internet service providers responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, electronic or mobile payments, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality
of products and services, taxation (including VAT or sales tax collection obligations, obligation to provide certain information about transactions that occurred through our platforms, or about our users), advertising, intellectual property rights,
consumer protection and information security.  We are also subject to regulations in Argentina that impose sales taxes and VAT
collection obligations on the Company based on users sales through the platform. Other jurisdictions may issue new legislation in that regard. If users were to reduce or stop using our website or services as a result of these regulations, our
business could be harmed.  We believe that the agency-based structure that we currently use for MercadoPago allows us to
operate this service without obtaining any governmental authorizations or licenses or being regulated as a financial institution in the countries where we offer MercadoPago. However, as we continue to develop MercadoPago, we may need to secure
governmental authorizations or licenses or comply with regulations applicable to financial institutions, electronic or mobile payments and/or anti-money laundering in the countries where we offer this service. 
There are laws and regulations that address foreign currency and exchange rates in every country in which we operate. In certain
countries where we operate, we need governmental authorization to pay invoices to a foreign supplier or send money abroad due to foreign exchange restrictions. See Risk factorsRisks related to doing business in Latin AmericaLocal
currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange controls for more information.  <FONT

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS  For
purposes of this section, the term stockholders means the holders of shares of our common stock. Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders and prospective stockholders. You should carefully consider
the following factors in evaluating our company, our properties and our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks might cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment in our Company. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones facing us. Other risks that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. Some statements in this report including
statements in the following risk factors section constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report. 
Risks related to our business  The
market for the sale of goods over the Internet in Latin America is developing, and our business depends on the continued growth of online commerce and the availability and suitability of the Internet in Latin America. 
The market for the sale of goods over the Internet is a new and emerging market in Latin America. Our future revenues depend substantially
on Latin American consumers widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as a way to conduct commerce. Rapid growth in the use of and interest in the Internet (particularly as a way to conduct commerce) is a recent phenomenon, and we cannot
assure you that this acceptance and use will continue to exist or develop. For us to grow our user base successfully, consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and services must accept and use new ways of
conducting business and exchanging information. Furthermore, the price of personal computers and Internet access may limit our potential growth in countries with low levels of Internet penetration and/or high levels of poverty. 
In addition, the Internet may not be commercially viable in Latin America in the long term for a number of reasons, including potentially
inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies, performance improvements and security measures. The infrastructure for the Internet may not be able to support continued growth in the
number of Internet users, their frequency of use or their bandwidth requirements. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in telecommunications technological developments, or due to increased government regulation. If
telecommunications services change or are not sufficiently available to support the Internet, response times would be slower, which would adversely affect use of the Internet and our service in particular. 
Our future success depends on our ability to expand and adapt our operations to meet rapidly changing industry and technology standards in a
cost-effective and timely manner, and on the continued market acceptance of our products and services.  We plan to
continue to expand our operations by developing and promoting new and complementary services. We may not succeed at expanding our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner, and our expansion efforts may not have the same or greater overall
market acceptance as our current services. Furthermore, any new business or service that we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands. To expand our operations we will also
need to spend significant amounts on development, operations and other resources, and we may place a strain on our management, financial and operational resources as a result. Similarly, a lack of market acceptance of these services or our inability
to generate satisfactory revenues from any expanded services to offset their cost could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Any delay or problem with upgrading our existing information technology infrastructure could cause a disruption in our business and adversely impact our financial results. 
Our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology
infrastructure. We are frequently implementing hardware and software technology upgrades, which may include migrations to new technology systems, in an effort to improve our systems. Our information technology systems may experience errors,
interruptions, delays or cessations of service. We are particularly susceptible to errors in connection with any systems upgrade or migration to a different hardware or software system. Errors or interruptions could impede or delay our ability to
process transactions on our site, which could reduce our revenue from activity on our site and adversely affect our reputation with, or result in the loss of users. These issues could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming,
and resource intensive than anticipated. Defects or disruptions in our technology infrastructure could adversely impact our ability to process transactions, our financial results and our reputation.

 Internet regulation in the countries where we operate is scarce, and several legal issues related to
the Internet are uncertain. We are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, and governments may enact laws or regulations that could adversely affect our business. 
Unlike the United States, most of the countries where we operate do not have specific laws governing the liability of Internet service
providers, such as ourselves, for fraud, intellectual property infringement, other illegal activities committed by individual users or third-party infringing content hosted on a providers servers. This legal uncertainty allows for different
judges or courts to decide very similar claims in different ways and establish contradictory jurisprudence. For example, in June 2009, a judge of a first instance court in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo ruled that our Brazilian subsidiary should
be held liable for fraud committed by sellers and losses incurred by buyers when purchasing items on the Brazilian version of the MercadoLibre website. We are appealing this ruling and, in December 2009, the effect of the ruling was suspended
until the appeal is decided by State Court of Appeals. If the ruling is upheld, it could require us to restructure our business model in ways that would harm our business and or cause us to incur substantial costs. 
In addition, certain judges may decide that Internet service providers are liable to an intellectual property owner for a users
sale of counterfeit items using our platform, while others may decide that the responsibility lies solely with the offending user. This legal uncertainty allows for rulings against us and could set adverse precedents, which individually or in the
aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, legal uncertainty may negatively affect our clients perception and use of our services. 
We are subject to a variety of laws, decrees and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in some of the
countries where we operate related to e-commerce, information requirements for Internet providers, data collection, data protection, privacy, anti-money laundering, taxation (including VAT or sales tax collection obligations), obligations to provide
certain information to certain authorities about transactions which through our platforms or about our users and those regulations applicable to businesses in general and consumer protection. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such
as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation (including taxation to provide certain information about transactions that consummated through our platforms or about our users), libel
and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy apply to online businesses. Many of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of
legal uncertainty, and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These laws and regulations could
cover issues such as online commerce, Internet service providers responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation (including
VAT or sales tax collection obligations, obligations to provide certain information about transactions occurred in our platforms or about our users), advertising, intellectual property rights, consumer protection, information security and electronic
and mobile payments. If laws relating to these issues are enacted, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  <FONT

business in their jurisdiction, either with respect to our services in general or only relating to certain items, such as auctions, real estate and motor vehicles. For example, numerous jurisdictions, including Brazil and Argentina, have regulations
regarding auctions and auctioneers and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers. Attempted enforcement of these laws against us or our users and other regulatory and licensing
claims could result in expensive litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business. Any changes in our or our users business methods could increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain
items for some locations. We could also be subject to fines or penalties, and any of these outcomes could harm our business. 
In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, other foreign
jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. As we expand and localize our international activities, we have to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Laws regulating Internet companies outside of the
Latin American jurisdictions where we operate may be more restrictive to us than those in Latin America. In order to comply with these laws, we may have to change our business practices or restrict our services. We could be subject to penalties
ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our services for failure to comply with foreign laws.  We are subject to laws
relating to the collection, use, storage and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users, especially financial information. Several jurisdictions have regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing
additional restrictions or regulations. If we violate these laws, which in many cases apply not only to third-party transactions but also to transfers of information among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial
relations, we could be subject to significant penalties and negative publicity, which would adversely affect us.  We are also
subject to certain regulations in Argentina that impose VAT and sales tax collection obligations on the Company in certain provinces in connection with users sales through the platform. Other jurisdictions may issue new legislation in that
regard. If users were to reduce or stop using our website or services as a result, our business could be materially harmed.

 We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.
 We receive scrutiny from various government agencies under competition laws in the countries where we operate. Some
jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies may allege that our actions violate antitrust or competition laws, or otherwise
constitute unfair competition. Contractual agreements with buyers, sellers, or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Also, our unilateral business practices could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust
litigation. Some regulators may perceive our business to have so much market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Such claims and investigations, even if without foundation, typically are very
expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in significant judgments against us.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our business is an Internet platform for commercial transactions in which all commercial activity depends on our users and is therefore largely outside of our control. 
Our business is dependent on Internet users listing and purchasing their items and services on our Internet platform. Therefore, we depend
on the commercial activity, including both sales and purchases that our users generate. We do not choose which items will be listed, nor do we make pricing or other decisions relating to the products and services bought and sold on our platform.
Therefore, the principal drivers of our business are largely outside of our control, and we depend on the continued preference for our platform by millions of individual users.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We could face liability for the sale of regulated and prohibited items, unpaid items or undelivered purchases, and the sale of defective items. 
Laws specifying the scope of liability of providers of online services for activities of their users through their service are currently
unsettled in most of the Latin American countries where we operate. We have implemented what we believe to be clear policies that are incorporated in our terms of use that prohibit the sale of certain items on our platform and have implemented
programs to monitor and exclude unlawful goods and services. Despite these efforts, we may be unable to prevent our users from exchanging unlawful goods or services or exchanging goods in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of
civil or criminal liability for the unlawful activities of these users.  More specifically, we are aware that certain goods,
such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, animals, adult material and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local or national authorities of various jurisdictions have been traded on the MercadoLibre Marketplace. As a consequence of these
transactions, appropriate authorities may impose fines against us. We have at times been subject to fines in Brazil for certain users sale of products that have not been approved by the government. We cannot provide any assurances that we will
successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities that our users carry out through our platforms in the future. If we suffer potential liability for any unlawful activities of our users, we may need to implement additional
measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, which may require, among other things that we spend substantial resources and/or discontinue certain service offerings. Any costs that we incur as a result of this liability or asserted liability
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We believe that
government and consumer protection agencies have received a substantial number of complaints about both the MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago. We believe that these complaints are small as a percentage of our total transactions, but they
could become large in aggregate numbers over time. From time to time, we are involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as
our business has expanded and our Company has grown larger. We are likely to receive new inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to actions against us. We have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies and
described our services, operating procedures and requested information. If one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines or penalties, or forced to
change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business, or if during these inquiries any of our processes are found to violate laws on consumer protection, or to constitute unfair business practices, we could be subject to civil
damages, enforcement actions, fines or penalties. Such actions or fines could require us to restructure our business processes in ways that would harm our business and cause us to incur substantial costs. 
In addition, our success depends largely upon sellers accurately representing and reliably delivering the listed goods and buyers paying
the agreed purchase price. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods agreed to be exchanged. While we can suspend the accounts of users
who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods sold. We also receive complaints from buyers regarding the quality of the goods purchased or the partial or
non-delivery of purchased items. We have tried to reduce our liability to buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods by offering a free Buyer Protection Program to buyers who meet certain
conditions. Although the number of claims that we have paid through this program is not currently significant, we may in the future receive additional requests from users requesting reimbursement or threatening legal action against us if we do not
reimburse them, the result of which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, as discussed above, we may be liable in Brazil for fraud committed by sellers and losses incurred by buyers when purchase items
through our platform in Brazil. We keep expanding the coverage of our Buyers Protection Program. This coverage expansion may impact the number and amount of reimbursements we are required to make. Our users have been and will continue to be
targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails that appear to be legitimate emails sent by MercadoLibre or MercadoPago or by a user of one of our businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by
the sender of the email or misstates that certain payment was credited in MercadoPago and request that the recipient send the product sold or send a password or other confidential information. Despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and
phishing emails, those activities could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands or discourage use of our websites and increase our costs.

 We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, legal
actions from users who received spoof emails and sent the product and did not receive the purchase price. Currently, we have a case, in which our Brazilian subsidiary was sued by a user that sent the product to the buyer but did not receive any
payment, since the email he received was a spoof and had not been sent by the Company. In 2007, a lower court judge found our Brazilian subsidiary responsible for that spoof and ordered it to pay the plaintiff the amount of approximately $1,500, to
be adjusted against inflation plus default interest, which was ratified by the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil . Our Brazilian subsidiary filed for clarification however the outcome of this matter is still pending. 
Any litigation related to unpaid or undelivered purchases or defective items could be expensive for us, divert managements
attention and could result in increased costs of doing business. In addition, any negative publicity generated as a result of the fraudulent or deceptive conduct of our users could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands.
 We could face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property and distribution rights of
others and for information disseminated on the MercadoLibre Marketplace.  Even though we monitor listings on our web
sites, we are not able to detect every item that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints alleging that certain items
listed and/or sold through the MercadoLibre Marketplace or Mercadoshops and/or using MercadoPago infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have
been active in defending their rights against online companies, including us. We have taken steps to work in coordination and cooperation with the intellectual property rights owners to seek to eliminate allegedly infringing items listed in the
MercadoLibre Marketplace. Our user policy prohibits the sale of goods which may infringe third-party intellectual property rights, and we may suspend the account of any user who infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Despite all these
measures some rights owners have expressed that our efforts are insufficient. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in asserting their purported rights against online companies. Allegations of infringement of
intellectual property rights could result in threats of litigation and actual litigation against us by rights owners. 
Specifically, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have already resulted in claims against us from time to time,
including litigation in Brazil brought (without limitation) by Cartier International B.V., Montblanc Simplo Gmbh, Richemont International S.A., Puma Sports Ltda., Lacoste do Brasil Ind&uacute;stria e Comercio Ltda., Sporloisirs S.A., Qix Skateboards
Ind&uacute;stria e Comercio Ltda, Vintage Denim Ltda., Editora COC Empreendimentos Culturais Ltda., Barros Fischer e Associados Ltda., Fallms Distribui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Fitas Ltda., 100% Nacional Distribuidora de Fitas Ltda., Xuxa

Industria e Distribui&ccedil;o Cinematogr&aacute;fica Ltda., and Citizen Watch do Brasil S/A and in Argentina brought by Nike International Ltd., Iglesia Mesianica Mundial Sekai Kyusei Kio. 
While we have been largely successful to date in settling existing claims by agreeing to monitor the brands, the current lack of laws
related to the Internet results in great uncertainty as to the outcome of any future claims. Other companies providing similar services to us have also been subject to these types of claims in the United States and other countries. In
June 2008, the Paris Court of Commerce ruled that eBay, Inc. and eBay International AG were liable to Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its web sites that traded on
plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network. The court awarded plaintiffs approximately EUR 38.6 million in damages and issued an injunction prohibiting all sales of perfumes and
cosmetics bearing the Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Kenzo brands over all worldwide eBay sites to the extent they are accessible from France. We cannot assure you that MercadoLibre and MercadoPago will not be subject to similar suits, which could
result in substantial monetary awards or penalties and costly injunctions against us.  We continue to have outstanding
litigation and, although we generally intend to defend each of these claims, we cannot assure you that we will be successful. This type of litigation is expensive for us, could result in damage awards or increased costs of doing business through
adverse judgments or settlements, could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require
us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs.  In addition, new bills of laws have been introduced in
the U.S. Congress proposing certain regulation to Internet companies with respect to intellectual property issues, like the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), that would give
intellectual property rights owners and the government broad powers to file lawsuits against websites accused of facilitating copyright infringement, and such lawsuits could result in, among other consequences, payment providers from doing business
with allegedly infringing sites, as well as search engines being precluded from linking to, and Internet service providers being required to block access to, such sites. If these or similar laws were finally enacted, it could have a negative impact
in our business.

 We are subject to risks with respect to information and material disseminated through our platforms.
 It is possible that third parties could bring claims against us for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy,
negligence, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our platforms. Other online services companies are facing several lawsuits for this type of liability. As mentioned previously, the liability of
online services companies for content hosted and the information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unclear in the Latin American countries where we operate. This could allow for claims being made against us by
purportedly aggrieved third parties. For example, the MercadoLibre service contains a User Feedback feature, which includes reviews and ratings from users regarding the reliability of other users in paying or delivering goods sold in a transaction
promptly. Although users generate all the feedback, it is possible that a party could bring a claim for defamation or other injury against us for content posted through the User Feedback feature. If we or other online services providers are held
liable or potentially liable for information carried on or disseminated through our platforms, we may have to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. Any measures we may need to implement may involve spending substantial
resources and/or discontinuing certain services. Any costs that we incur as a result of liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, public
attention to liability issues, lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of Internet use, and subsequently have a negative impact on our business results.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The market in which we operate is rapidly evolving and we may not be able to maintain our profitability.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As a result of the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, the increased variety of services offered on our web site and the rapidly evolving nature of our business, it is particularly
difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. In addition, we have no backlog and substantially all of our net revenues for each quarter are derived from listing fees, optional feature fees, up-front fees, final value fees,
commissions on MercadoPago payments and advertising that are earned during that quarter. Our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues and are, to a large extent, fixed. We may not
be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.  If we continue to grow, we may not be able to appropriately manage the increased size of our
business.  We have experienced significant expansion in recent years and anticipate that further expansion will be
required to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities. This expansion has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on management and our operational and financial resources. 
We must constantly add new hardware, update software, enhance and improve our billing and transaction systems, and add and train new
engineering and other personnel to accommodate the increased use of our web site and the new products and features we regularly introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increasing complexity and enhancement of our web site results in
higher costs. Failure to upgrade our technology, features, transaction processing systems, security infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could materially harm our business. Adverse
consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of our services and delays in reporting accurate financial information.
 Our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow our transaction-processing capabilities to
accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our web site would materially harm our business and our ability to collect revenue.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Furthermore, we may need to enter into relationships with various strategic partners, web sites and other online service providers and other third parties necessary to our business. The increased
complexity of managing multiple commercial relationships could lead to execution problems that can affect current and future revenues and operating margins.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our current and planned systems, procedures and controls, personnel and third party relationships may not be adequate to support our future operations. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our systems may fail or suffer interruptions
due to human acts, technical problems, or natural disasters.  Our success, and in particular our ability to facilitate
trades or payments successfully and provide high quality customer service, depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems. Substantially all of our computer hardware for operating the
MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago services is currently located at the facilities of the Savvis Datacenter in Sterling, Virginia, with a redundant database backup in Atlanta, Georgia. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, power loss, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar events. If our system suffers a
major failure, it would take as much as several days to get the service running again because our Atlanta database is only a backup with very limited hardware.

 We also have no formal disaster recovery plan or alternative providers of hosting services and do not carry
business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we have taken or plan to take, if there is a natural disaster or major failure, a decision by our providers to close one of the facilities we use
without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problem at the Virginia or Atlanta facilities, the services we provide could suffer interruptions. We currently have no plans to upgrade the Atlanta facility capabilities. Additionally, in the
occurrence of such pronounced, frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and name brand could be materially adversely affected. 
We are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business.
 A significant risk associated with online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential
information over public networks. Currently, a number of MercadoLibre users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts or debit their bank accounts directly, or use MercadoPago to pay for their transactions. We rely on encryption and
authentication necessary to provide the security and authentication technology to transmit confidential information securely, including customer credit card numbers and other account information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in
the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data. If our security were compromised, it could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
As stated above, our users are targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate
passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses to our users computers. Those emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by MercadoLibre or MercadoPago or by a user of one of our businesses, but direct
recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or misstates that certain payment was credited in MercadoPago and request that the recipient send the product sold or provide a password or other confidential information. Despite our
efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails, those activities could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands or discourage use of our websites and increase our costs. 
We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Our performance depends substantially on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel.
Our ability to retain and motivate these and other officers and employees is fundamental to our performance.  Our most senior
executive officers have been with us since 2000 or before, providing us with a stable and experienced management team. The loss of the services of any of these executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key technical personnel other than our senior executives (whose agreements are for an undetermined period and establish general employment
terms and conditions) and maintain no key person life insurance policies. The option grants to most of our senior management and key employees are fully vested. Therefore, these employees may not have sufficient financial incentive to
stay with us. Consequently we may have to incur costs to replace key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired if we cannot replace them in a timely manner. 
Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical,
managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate, train, retain, motivate and manage sufficiently qualified personnel.
 Currently our revenues depend substantially on up-front fees, final value fees and fees related to our payment solution we charge to
sellers and such revenues may decrease if market conditions force us to lower such fees or if we fail to diversify our sources of revenue.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our revenues currently depend primarily on up-front fees, final value fees and fees related to our payment solution that we charge to our sellers for listing and upon selling their items and services. Our
platform depends upon providing access to a large market at a lower cost than other comparable alternatives. If market conditions force us to substantially lower our listing or final value fees or fees related to our payment solution or if we fail
to continue to attract new buyers and sellers, and if we are unable to effectively diversify and expand our sources of revenue, our profitability, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
We are subject to consumer trends and could lose revenue if certain items become less popular. 
We derive substantially all of our revenues from fees charged to sellers for listing products for sale on our service, fees from
successfully completed transactions and fees for making payments through MercadoPago. Our future revenues depend on continued demand for the types of goods that users list on the MercadoLibre Marketplace or pay with MercadoPago on or off the
MercadoLibre Marketplace. The popularity of certain categories of items, such as computer and electronic products, cellular telephones, toys, apparel and sporting goods, among consumers may vary over time due to perceived availability, subjective
value, and trends of consumers and society in general. A decline in the demand for or popularity of certain items sold through the MercadoLibre Marketplace without an increase in demand for different items could reduce the overall volume of
transactions on our platforms, resulting in reduced revenues. 
   18 





Table of Contents

 In addition, certain consumer fads may temporarily inflate the volume of certain types of items
listed on the MercadoLibre Marketplace, placing a significant strain on our infrastructure and transaction capacity. These trends may also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from one quarter to the next. 
Retailers may encourage manufacturers to limit distribution of their products to dealers who sell through us, or may encourage the government to
limit online commerce.  Manufacturers may attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance arrangements to prevent
distributors from selling on our websites or on the Internet generally, or at prices that would make our site attractive relative to other alternatives. The adoption by manufacturers of policies, or the adoption of new laws or regulations or
interpretations of existing laws or regulations by government authorities, in each case discouraging the sales of goods or services over the Internet, could force our users to stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased competition or
anti-Internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brand. In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make
pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among some of our sellers, which could reduce activity on our websites and harm our profitability. 
The success of other e-commerce companies such as eBay and Amazon is not an indication of our future financial performance. 
Several companies that operate e-commerce web sites, such as eBay and Amazon, have been successful and profitable in the past. However, we
operate in a business environment that is different from eBays, Amazons and other e-commerce companies operating outside of Latin America. These differences include the smaller size of the national markets, lower Internet adoption rates,
lower confidence in remote payment mechanisms, less reliable postal and parcel services, and less predictable political, economic regulatory and legal environments. Therefore, you should not interpret the success of any of these companies as
indicative of our financial prospects.  Finally, Amazon started operations in Brazil during 2012 by offering on-line content.
We do not compete in this space, however the consolidation and expansion of their operations in Brazil, could eventually lead to more direct competition.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We could be subject to liability and forced to change our MercadoPago business practices if we were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing banking, money
transmission, tax regulation, anti-money laundering regulations or electronic funds transfers in any country where we operate; or if new legislation regarding these issues were enacted in the countries where MercadoPago operates. 
A number of jurisdictions where we operate have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters. We believe we do not require a license
under the existing statutes of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela to operate MercadoPago with its current agency-based structure. If our operation of MercadoPago were found to be in violation of money services laws or
regulations or any tax or anti-money laundering regulations, or engaged in an unauthorized banking or financial business, we could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain countries, or forced to change our
business practices or to become a financial entity. Any change to our MercadoPago business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the speed of trade
on the MercadoLibre Marketplace, which would further harm our business. Even if we are not forced to change our MercadoPago business practices, we could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could be very expensive and time
consuming, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain these licenses in a timely manner or at all.  MercadoPago is
susceptible to illegal uses, and we could potentially face liability for any illegal use of MercadoPago.  MercadoPago,
like the MercadoLibre platform, is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including, fraudulent and illicit sales, money laundering, bank fraud, different fraud schemes and online securities fraud. In addition, MercadoPagos
service could be subject to unauthorized credit card use, identity theft, break-ins to withdraw account balances, employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and we may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of
such breaches. Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using MercadoPago, if they are affected by buyer fraud.  In
addition, MercadoPago may be subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities or impose taxes collection obligations or obligation to provide
certain information about transactions occurred in our platforms, or about our users. Because of different laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate, as we roll-out and adapt MercadoPago in other countries, additional verification
and reporting requirements could apply. These regulations could impose significant costs on us and make it more difficult for new customers to join the MercadoPago network. Future regulation (under the USA Patriot Act or otherwise), may require us
to learn more about the identity of our MercadoPago customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor our customers activities more closely. These requirements, as well as any additional
restrictions imposed by credit card associations, could raise our MercadoPago costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of MercadoPago. Failure to comply with money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits,
penalties, and forfeiture of significant assets.  We incur losses from claims that customers did not authorize a purchase,
from buyer fraud and from erroneous transmissions. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could result in MercadoPago losing the right to accept credit cards for
payment. If MercadoPago is unable to accept credit cards, our business will be adversely affected given that credit cards are the most widely used method for funding the MercadoPago accounts. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of
fraud on MercadoPago, such as running card security code (CSC) checks in some countries, having users call us to have them answer personal questions to confirm their identity or asking users to confirm the amount of a small debit for higher
risk transactions, implementing caps on overall spending per users and data mining to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. However, these measures may not be effective against current and new forms of fraud. If these measures do not succeed,
excessive charge-backs may arise in the future and our business will be adversely affected.

 Our failure to manage MercadoPago customer funds properly would harm our business. 
Our ability to manage and account accurately for MercadoPago customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. We have neither an
established operating history nor proven management experience in maintaining, over a long term, these internal controls. As MercadoPago continues to grow, we must strengthen our internal controls accordingly. MercadoPagos success requires
significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to properly manage customer funds could severely reduce customer use of
MercadoPago.  MercadoPago is a relatively new service that faces competition from other payment method and competitors may adversely
affect the success of MercadoPago.  MercadoPago competes with existing online and offline payment methods, including,
among others, banks and other providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits; international online payments services such as PayPal and Google Checkout, and local online
payment services such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and Bcash, PagSeguro and MOIP in Brazil; money remitters such as Western Union; the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin America; and offline funding
alternatives such as cash deposit and money transmission services. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than MercadoPagos current rates and, accordingly, we are subject to market pressures with respect to the
commissions we charge for MercadoPago services.  MercadoPagos competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies
and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than us. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services than we do for MercadoPago. Competing services tied to established banks and
other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and create greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than MercadoPago. Established banks and other financial institutions currently offer online payments and
those which do not yet provide such a service could quickly and easily develop it, including mobile phone carriers.  We are
currently in the process of rolling out our direct payments product in some countries in order to provide a better experience to our users. For the same reason we are also charging a single final value fee for the right to use MercadoLibre and
MercadoPago in those transactions. This change may result in our experiencing a lower combined take rate. We consider MercadoPagos direct payments product to be in early release and have identified several opportunities to improve upon
the product. In addition, the transition to the new system may not be a smooth one. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We continue to expand MercadoPagos services internationally. We have no experience with the online payment solution in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Portugal or Uruguay.
In order to introduce MercadoPago in some countries we may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks. These or other factors may prevent, delay or limit our introduction of MercadoPago in other countries, or reduce its
profitability.  We rely on banks or payment processors to fund transactions, and changes to credit card association fees, rules or
practices may adversely affect our business.  Because MercadoPago is not a bank, we cannot belong to or directly access
credit card associations, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result, we must rely on banks or payment processors to process the funding of MercadoPago transactions and MercadoLibre Marketplace collections, and must pay a fee for this service. From
time to time, credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. The credit card processors of MercadoPago and the MercadoLibre Marketplace have the right to pass any increases
in interchange fees on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase the operating costs of MercadoPago, reduce our profit margins from MercadoPago operations and, to a lesser degree, affect the operating
margins of the MercadoLibre Marketplace.  We are also required by MercadoPago and MercadoLibres processors to comply
with credit card association operating rules. The credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret the credit card rules. Some of those member banks compete with MercadoPago. Visa, MasterCard, American Express or other credit card
companies could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules that we or MercadoPagos processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, we could lose our ability to provide MercadoPago customers the option
of using credit cards to fund their payments and MercadoLibre users the option to pay their fees using a credit card. If MercadoPago were unable to accept credit cards, our MercadoPago business would be adversely affected.

 We could lose the right to accept credit cards or pay fines if MasterCard and/or Visa
determine that users are using MercadoPago to engage in illegal or high risk activities or if users generate a large amount of chargebacks. Accordingly, we are working to prevent high risk merchants from using MercadoPago.
Additionally, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates to fund our MercadoPago and for that reason our profitability and total payments volume could materially decline. 
Our operating results may be impacted by an economic crisis.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">General adverse economic conditions, including the possibility of a severe recession and a worldwide economic slowdown, would adversely impact our operating results and business. If the current weakness
in the global economy persists or worsens, or the present global economic uncertainties persist for an extended period of time, many of our users, may delay or reduce their purchases of goods on the MercadoLibre Marketplace, which would reduce our
revenues and have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. 
The failure of the financial institutions with which we conduct business may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and
financial condition.  The financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil in 2008 and 2009,
characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments. If the condition of the financial services industry again deteriorates or
becomes weakened for an extended period of time, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition:   



 

 
 Disruptions to the capital markets or the banking system may materially adversely affect the value of investments or bank deposits we currently
consider safe or liquid. We may be unable to find suitable alternative investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons; 
 


 

 
 We may be required to increase the installment and financing fees we charge to customers for purchases made in installments or cease offering
installment purchases altogether, each of which may result in a lower volume of transactions completed;   


 

 
 We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. Due to the
nature of our MercadoPago business, we generate high account receivable balances that we typically sell to financial institutions, and accordingly, lack of access to credit, or bank liquidations could cause us to experience severe difficulties in
paying our sellers; and   


 

 
 The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on
and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under difficult market conditions.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A rise in interest rates may negatively affect our MercadoPago payment volume.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In each of Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, we offer users the ability to pay for goods purchased using MercadoPago in installments. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, installment payments represented 48.3%, 52.5% and
54.6%, respectively, of MercadoPagos total payment volume. To facilitate the offer of the installment payment feature, we pay interest to credit card processors and issuer banks in Mexico and Argentina and we pay interest to advance credit
card coupons in Brazil. In all of these cases, if interest rates increase, we may have to raise the installment fees we charge to users which would likely have a negative effect on MercadoPagos total payment volume. 
Changes in MercadoPagos funding mix could adversely affect MercadoPagos results. 
MercadoPago pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards, PagoMisCuentas and Pago
F&aacute;cil, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions from their bank accounts in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing MercadoPago account balance. Senders funded
approximately 76.6%, 76.0% and 71.3% of MercadoPagos payment volume using credit cards during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively (either in a single payment or in installments), and MercadoPagos financial success will remain highly
sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer credit card funding rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons, including the ability to pay in installments in Brazil, Mexico
and Argentina, the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flyer miles or other incentives offered by credit cards, the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to
provide bank account information to us. Also, in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina senders may prefer to pay with credit card without using installments to avoid the associated financial costs resulting in lower financial revenues. 
Changes in MercadoPago ticket mix could adversely affect MercadoPagos results. 
The transaction fees MercadoPago pays in connection with certain means of payment such as OXXO are fixed regardless of the ticket price,
and certain costs incurred in connection with the processing of credit card transactions are also fixed. Currently, MercadoPago charges a fee calculated as a percentage of each transaction. If MercadoPago receives a larger percentage of low ticket
transactions its margin may erode or we may need to raise prices by including a fixed fee per transaction which, in turn, may affect the volume of transactions.

 We have no business insurance coverage, which would require us to spend significant resources in the
event of a disruption of our services or other contingency.  Insurance companies in Latin America offer limited
business insurance products. We do not carry any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations. Any business disruption, litigation, system failure or natural disaster may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert
resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  We may not be able
to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We could potentially face claims alleging that our technologies infringe the property rights of others. 
We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our
future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and
invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and certain suppliers and strategic partners in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We
cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements or the other steps that we have taken or will take in the future to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent
third-parties from developing similar or competing technologies.  We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks,
logos and service marks in each country where we operate, in the United States and in certain other Latin American countries. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, domain name and trade secret protection may not be available or granted to us
by the appropriate regulatory authority in every country in which our services are made available online. For example, since 1999, we have filed several applications to register the name MercadoLivre and our logo in Brazil. We have
been granted the trademarks Mercadolivre (name and design, without the exclusivity to the use of the words Mercado and Livre) and MercadoPago (name and design). Nonetheless, many applications
are still pending and certain applications were denied in that country under the argument that the name was descriptive of its activities. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining these trademarks or in our challenges to existing or
future applications by other parties or by the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (the National Institute of Industrial Property). If we are not successful, MercadoLibres ability to protect its brand in Brazil against third-party
infringers would be compromised and we could face claims by any future trademark owners. Any past or future claims relating to these issues, whether meritorious or not, could cause us to enter into costly royalty and/or licensing agreements. If any
of these claims against us are successful we may also have to modify our brand name in certain countries. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or
copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the MercadoLibre brand, our licensees may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or
reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  To
date, we have not been notified that our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties may claim infringement on our part with respect to past, current or future technologies or features of our services. We
expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in the e-commerce segment grows. Any of these claims could have a material adverse effect upon our business,
results of operations and financial condition.  Since 2001, eBay has been subject to a lawsuit alleging infringement of
patents relating to online consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems. In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against eBay and their subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Virginia alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent injunction and damages (including
treble damages for willful infringement). Following a trial and jury verdict, in August 2003, the court entered judgment for MercExchange in the amount of approximately $30 million plus pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest, but
refused to grant an injunction. eBay appealed the verdict and judgment in favor of MercExchange, and MercExchange filed a cross-appeal. In May 2006, following appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court,
the Supreme Court ruled that an outright denial of an injunction in a patent case is not appropriate, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On August 28, 2006, MercExchange renewed its motion for a permanent
injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Final briefs on such motion were filed in March 2007, and in July 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied MercExchanges motion
for permanent injunction. MercExchange subsequently entered a notice of appeal. In December 2007, the court entered judgment for MercExchange for $25 million plus prejudgment and post judgment interest. eBay subsequently entered a notice
of appeal.  In February 2008, eBay and all parties involved agreed to settle and dismiss all claims and appeals stemming
from the lawsuit. As a part of the settlement, eBay purchased all three patents involved in the lawsuit, and related technology and inventions, as well as a license to another search-related patent portfolio that was not asserted in the lawsuit.
 From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business expands and we grow larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in expensive litigation,
require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources.

 We may not be able to secure licenses for third-party technologies upon which we rely.
 We rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties, such as Oracle Corp., SAP AG, Salesforce.com Inc.,
Microstrategy, Radware, Juniper Networks, Cisco Systems Inc, F5 Networks, and Netapp, the suppliers of key database technology, operating system and specific hardware components for our services. We cannot assure you that these third-party
technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If we were not able to make use of this technology, we would need to obtain substitute technology that may be of lower quality or performance standards or at
greater cost, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service providers
on acceptable terms, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so in the future.  Problems that affect our third-party
service providers could potentially adversely affect us as well.  A number of parties provide beneficial services to us
or to our users. These services include the hosting of our servers, and the postal and payments infrastructures that allow users to deliver and pay for the goods and services traded amongst themselves, in addition to paying their MercadoLibre
Marketplace bills. Financial, regulatory, or other problems that might prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our web sites or make completing transactions on our web sites more
difficult, which would harm our business. Any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business. 
Complaints from customers or negative publicity about our services can diminish consumer confidence and adversely affect our business.
 Because volume and growth in adoption of new users are key factors for our profitability, customer complaints or
negative publicity about our customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers.
To maintain good customer relations, we need prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense and investment in developing programs and technology
infrastructure to help customer service representatives carry out their functions. These expenses, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could
compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence. 
As part of our program to reduce fraud losses in relation to MercadoPago, we make use of MercadoPago anti-fraud models and we may
temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if we identify those funds or the customers account activity as suspicious. MercadoPago has not been subject to any significant negative publicity about this. However, users
who were banned from withdrawing funds or received fake mail appearing to be sent by MercadoPago initiated legal actions against us. As a result of our efforts to police the use of our services, MercadoPago may receive negative publicity, our
ability to attract new MercadoPago customers may be damaged, and we could become subject to litigation. If any of these events happen, current and future revenues could suffer, and our database technology operating margins may decrease. In addition,
negative publicity about or experiences with MercadoPago customer support could cause MercadoLibres reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in the MercadoLibre brand.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We may not realize benefits from recent or future strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies, services or products despite their costs in cash and dilution to our stockholders.
 We intend to continue to acquire businesses, technologies, services or products, as we have done in the past with our
acquisitions of iBazar, Lokau, DeRemate, CMG and AutoPlaza, which we believe are strategic, if an appropriate opportunity presents itself. We may not, however, be able to identify, negotiate or finance such future acquisitions successfully or at
favorable valuations, or to effectively integrate these acquisitions with our current business. The process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
expenditures. Moreover, future acquisitions may also generate unforeseen pressures and/or strains on our organizational culture. 
   23 





Table of Contents

 Additionally, acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If debt financing for potential future acquisitions is
unavailable, we may determine to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock in connection with such an acquisition and any such issuance could result in the dilution of our common stock. 
We are subject to seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations. 
We believe that our results of operations are somewhat seasonal in nature (as is the case with traditional retailers), with relatively
fewer listings and transactions in the first quarters of the year, and increased activity as the year-end shopping season initiates. This seasonality is the result of fewer listings after the Christmas and other holidays and summer vacation periods
in our Southern hemisphere markets. To some degree, our historical rapid growth may have overshadowed seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations could become more
pronounced over time, which could materially adversely affect our quarter to quarter results of operations in the future.  We operate in
a highly competitive and evolving market, and therefore face potential reductions in the use of our service.  The
market for trading over the Internet is relatively new in Latin America, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to become more intense in the future. Barriers to entry are relatively low and current offline and new
competitors, including small businesses who want to create and promote their own stores or platforms, can easily launch new sites at relatively low cost using software that is commercially available. We currently or potentially compete with a number
of other companies.  Our direct competitors include various online sales and auction services, including MasOportunidades.com
in Argentina, and a number of other small services, including those that serve specialty markets. We also compete with business-to-consumer online e-commerce services, such as pure play Internet retailer Submarino (a website of B2W Inc), and a
growing number of bricks and mortar retailers who have launched on line offerings such as Americanas (a website of B2W Inc), Casas Bahia and Falabella, OLX, QueBarato and with shopping comparison sites located throughout Latin America such as
Buscape and Bondfaro, located throughout Latin America. In addition, we compete with online communities that specialize in classified advertisements. Although no regional competitor exists in the classified market, local players such as Webmotors,
VivaStreet and Zap have important positions in certain markets.  We face competition from a number of large online communities
and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating online interaction. Certain of these competitors, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo! currently offer a variety of business-to-consumer commerce services,
searching services and classified advertising services, and certain of these companies may introduce broader online commerce to their large user populations. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in online commerce, such
as large newspaper or media companies also compete in the online listing market. Companies with experience in online commerce, such as Amazon, may also seek to compete in the online listing market in Latin America. We also compete with traditional
brick-and-mortar retailers to the extent buyers choose to purchase products in a physical establishment as opposed to on our platform. In connection with our payment solution, our direct competitors include international online payments services
such as PayPal and Google Checkout, and local online payment services such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and Bcash, PagSeguro and MOIP in Brazil; money remitters such as Western Union. Any or all of these companies could
create competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, if certain websites stop linking to or containing links in their properties that send us traffic across the internet in the future, our GMV could substantially decrease and we could suffer a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We no longer have a non-competition
arrangement with eBay. If eBay were to compete directly with us by launching a competing platform in Latin America, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. Similarly, eBay or other larger, well-established
and well-financed companies may acquire, invest in or enter into other commercial relationships with competing online commerce services. Therefore, some of our competitors and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to
marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to web site and systems development than us, which could adversely affect us. Paypal is already active locally in Brazil and Mexico.
 In many cases, companies that directly or indirectly compete with us provide Internet access. These competitors include
incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and large Internet service providers. Some of these providers may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customers use of our services.
For example, they could restrict or prohibit the use of their lines for our services, filter, block or delay the packets containing the data associated with our products, charge increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to provide our
services, or seek to charge us for our customers use of our services or receipt of our e-mails. These activities are technically feasible. Although we have not identified any providers who intend to take these actions, any interference with
our services or higher charges for access to the Internet, could cause us to lose existing users, impair our ability to attract new users, limit our potential expansion and harm our revenue and growth.

 Risks related to doing business in Latin America 
Political and economic conditions in Venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations. 
We conduct significant operations in Venezuela, offering both our MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago online payments solution, and
have 153 employees who work in the country at December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our Venezuelan net revenues represented 14.6% of our consolidated net revenues. The political and economic conditions in Venezuela are
very unstable, and we cannot predict the impact of any future political and economic events on our business. We cannot predict the economic and regulatory impact of Venezuelan governments initiatives, or whether it will extend nationalization
to e-commerce or other businesses that could impact our business and results of operations. Nationalization of telecommunications, electrical or other companies could reduce our or our customers access to our web site or our services or
increase the costs of providing or accessing our services. Certain political events have also resulted in significant civil unrest in the country. Continuation or worsening of the political and economic conditions in Venezuela could materially and
adversely impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations.  Venezuela has suffered severe
electricity shortages that prompted the Venezuelan government to declare an energy emergency. This situation could impact the operation of our automobile classifieds points of sale in Venezuela as well as our Venezuelan users ability to access
the Internet, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In addition, the Venezuelan government
has imposed foreign exchange and price controls on the local currency. These foreign exchange controls increase our costs to, and also limit our ability to, convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of Venezuela, and may have
an adverse effect on our Venezuelan customers. We cannot predict the long-term effects of exchange controls on our ability to process payments from Venezuelan customers or on the Venezuelan economy in general. 
Venezuela had an official exchange rate which was 2.15 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2009, and a
parallel exchange rate that was 6.05 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that the fixed official rate of 2.15 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S.
would be changed to a dual system that included a rate of 2.6 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar for food and heavy machine importers and a rate of 4.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar for all others. 
In 2009, we requested U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate for the first time for dividend distributions, through a process that
included obtaining approval from the CADIVI. We cannot predict if we will obtain approval of the CADIVI to distribute dividends using the official Venezuelan exchange rate, and the future impact in our financial condition. Starting in the fourth
quarter of 2009, as a result of the changes in facts and circumstances that affected the Companys ability to convert currency for dividends remittances using the official exchange rate in Venezuela, our Venezuelan subsidiaries assets,
liabilities, income and expense accounts were translated using the parallel exchange rate.  Until May 13, 2010, the only
way by which U.S. dollars could be purchased outside the official currency market was using an indirect mechanism consisting in the purchase and sale of securities, including national public debt bonds (DPNs) denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and
bonds issued by the government that were denominated in U.S. dollars. This mechanism for transactions in certain securities created an indirect parallel foreign currency exchange market in Venezuela that enabled entities to obtain
foreign currency through financial brokers without going through CADIVI. Although the parallel exchange rate was higher, and accordingly less beneficial, than the official exchange rate, some entities used the parallel market to exchange
currency because, as it was already mentioned, CADIVI used not to approve in a timely manner the exchange of currency requested by such entities. Until May 13, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiaries used this mechanism to buy US dollars and
accordingly we used the parallel average exchange rate to re-measure those foreign currency transactions.  However, on
May 14th, 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange regulations and closed down the parallel market by declaring that foreign-currency-denominated securities issued by Venezuelan entities were included in the definition of
foreign currency, thus making the BCV the only institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds, thereby excluding non-authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market. 
Trading of foreign currencies was re-opened as a regulated market on June 9, 2010 with the BCV as the only institution through which
foreign currency-denominated transactions can be brokered. Under the SITME, entities domiciled in Venezuela can buy U.S. dollardenominated securities only through banks authorized by the BCV to import goods, services or capital inputs.
Additionally, the SITME imposed volume restrictions on an entitys trading activity, limiting such activity to a maximum equivalent of $50,000 per day, not to exceed $350,000 in a calendar month. This limitation was non-cumulative, meaning that
an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next.  As a consequence of this new system, commencing on
June 9, 2010, we transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the SITME rate and started re-measuring foreign currency transactions using the SITME rate published by BCV, which was 5.27 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar as of
June 9, 2010.  For the period beginning on May 14, 2010 and ending on June 8, 2010 (during which there was no
open foreign currency markets) we applied U.S. GAAP guidelines, which state that if exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date, the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could
be made shall be used. 
   25 





Table of Contents

 Accordingly, the June 9, 2010 exchange rate published by the VCB has been used to
re-measure transactions during the abovementioned period.  On February 8, 2013, the Government of Venezuela, through the
Foreign Exchange Agreement No. 14, has devaluated as from February 9, 2013, the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollars. The devaluation did not have an effect on the 2012 consolidated financial
statements; however, the devaluation will require remeasurement of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities as from February 9, 2013. 
In addition, on February 8, 2013, the Government of Venezuela, through Decree No. 9381 (the Decree) has created the
Organo Superior para la Optimizaci&oacute;n del Sistema Cambiario (or the Committee), a committee that will have the authority to design, plan and execute foreign exchange policies. At the date of this consolidated financial statements,
the Committee created by the Decree, is under the process of being designated.  Finally, on February 9, 2013, the Central
Bank of Venezuela has eliminated the SITME. Had the devaluation occurred on December 31, 2012, and had been 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollars the exchange rate at which the Company could have had access to the foreign exchange market, the
Company would have recorded a translation loss of approximately $ 5.7 million on its year-end consolidated financial statements, considering the non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the Companys Venezuelan
subsidiaries as of that date. Because of the elimination of the SITME, we cannot assure that the foreign exchange rate at which we would have access for settling transactions denominated in U.S. dollars will be 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S.
dollars.  In addition, due to unstable political and economic conditions in Venezuela, the official and parallel exchange
rates could continue to devalue significantly. Strong devaluations or changes in accounting rules could impact our results materially and we may have to recognize losses in the future. 
For accounting purposes, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy beginning January 1, 2010 because the three-year
cumulative blended inflation rate exceeded 100%. For this reason, as from that date, we are required to account for the operations of our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the functional currency of MercadoLibre, Inc., which is the U.S. dollar, rather
than the Bolivares Fuertes as the functional currency. As a consequence, we may experience a decrease in terms of U.S. dollars of our Venezuela revenues and expenses, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations in U.S.
dollars.  The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the highly inflationary status and the government price control could
have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We face the risk of political and economic crises, instability, terrorism, civil strife, expropriation and other risks of doing business in
emerging markets.  We conduct our operations in emerging market countries in Latin America. Economic and political
developments in these countries, including future economic changes or crises (such as inflation, currency devaluation or recession), government deadlock, political instability, terrorism, civil strife, changes in laws and regulations, expropriation
or nationalization of property, and exchange controls could impact our operations or the market value of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
In the past, the performance of the economies of Latin American countries has been affected by each countrys political situation.
For example, during its crisis in 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced social and political turmoil, including civil unrest, riots, looting, protests, strikes and street demonstrations which have resulted in significant changes in its general
economic policies and regulations. More recently, the Argentine, Venezuelan and Bolivian administrations have nationalized or announced plans to nationalize certain industries and expropriate certain companies and property, and, in Venezuela, as
described above, the administration has imposed exchange controls.  Although economic conditions in one country may differ
significantly from another country, we cannot assure that events in one country alone will not adversely affect the market value of, or market for, our common stock.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Latin American governments have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over the economies of the countries where we operate. This involvement, as well as political and economic
conditions, could adversely affect our business.  Governments in Latin America frequently intervene in the economies of
their respective countries and occasionally make significant changes in policy and regulations. Governmental actions to control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, price controls, currency
devaluations, capital controls and limits on imports. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected by changes in government policies or regulations, including such factors as: exchange rates and
exchange control policies; inflation rates; interest rates; tariff and inflation control policies; price control policies; import duties and restrictions; liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets; electricity rationing; tax policies,
including royalty, tax increases and retroactive tax claims; and other political, diplomatic, social and economic developments in or affecting the countries where we operate. An eventual reduction of foreign investment in any of the countries where
we operate may have a negative impact on such countrys economy, affecting interest rates and the ability of companies such as ours to access financial markets. In addition, our employees in Brazil and some of our employees in Argentina are
currently represented by a labor union and employees in other Latin American countries may eventually become unionized. We may incur increased payroll costs and reduced flexibility under labor regulations if unionization in other countries were to
occur, any of which may negatively impact our business.

 Latin America, including Argentina, has experienced adverse economic conditions. 
Latin American countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation
and economic instability. Currently, as a consequence of adverse economic conditions in global markets and diminishing commodity prices, many of the economies of Latin American countries have slowed their rates of growth, and some have entered mild
recessions. The duration and severity of this slowdown is hard to predict and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, certain countries have experienced severe economic crises, which may
still have future effects. For example, in 2001 Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt due to severe economic turmoil. In the first half of 2005, Argentina restructured part of this sovereign debt. Certain creditors did not agree to the
restructuring. Argentinas past default and its failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and fully negotiate with the holdout creditors may prevent Argentina from obtaining favorable terms or interest rates when accessing
the international capital markets. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors or other parties may result in material judgments against the Argentine government and could result in attachments of or injunctions relating to assets of Argentina that
the government intended for other uses. As a result, the government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and foster growth, which could have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy. 
In addition, as a result of this economic instability, the Argentine peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may
be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. In August 2008, Standard & Poors Inc. downgraded Argentinas foreign debt rating based upon renewed concerns regarding economic conditions and rising fears of increased
inflationary pressures. Such economic turmoil has given rise to significant uncertainties about Argentinas economic and political future. It is currently unclear whether the economic and political instability experienced over the past several
years will continue and it is possible, that despite recent economic growth, Argentina may return to a deeper recession, higher inflation and unemployment and greater social unrest. We conduct significant operations in Argentina, offering both our
MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago online payments solution in Argentina and have our corporate headquarters in that country. Argentina is our second leading revenue producing country. As a result, our business is to a very large extent
dependent upon the economic conditions prevalent in Argentina and adverse economic conditions in that country, as well as any other Latin American country in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.  Local currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange
controls.  The currencies of many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela, which
together accounted for 93.6%, 93.6% and 93.5% of our net revenues for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have experienced volatility in the past, particularly against the U.S. dollar. Currency movements, as well as higher interest rates, have
materially and adversely affected the economies of many Latin American countries, including countries which account, or are expected to account, for a significant portion of our revenues. The depreciation of local currencies creates inflationary
pressures that may have an adverse effect on us and generally restricts access to the international capital markets. For example, the devaluation of the Argentine peso has had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to honor their
foreign currency denominated debt, led to very high inflation initially, significantly reduced real wages, had a negative impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand, and adversely affected the governments ability
to honor its foreign debt obligations. On the other hand, the appreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar may lead to the deterioration of public accounts and the balance of payments of the countries where we operate, and may reduce
export growth in those countries.  We may be subject to exchange control regulations which might restrict our ability to
convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. For example, in 2001 and 2002, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. During 2011
and 2012, the Argentine government has implemented certain measures that control and restrict the ability of companies and individuals to exchange Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies. Those measures include, among other things, the requirement to
obtain the prior approval from the Argentine Tax Authority of the foreign currency transaction (for example and without limitation, for the payment of non-Argentine goods and services, payment of principal and interest on non-Argentine debt and also
payment of dividends to parties outside of the country), which approval process could delay, and eventually restrict, the ability to exchange Argentine pesos for other currencies, such as U.S. dollars. Those approvals are administered by the
Argentine Central Bank through the Local Exchange Market (Mercado Unico Libre de Cambios or MULC), which is the only market where exchange transactions may be lawfully made. Further, restrictions also currently apply to the
acquisition of any foreign currency for holding as cash within Argentina. In addition, Brazilian law provides that whenever there is a serious imbalance in Brazils balance of payments or reason to foresee a serious imbalance, the Brazilian
government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investments in Brazil. Recently, Venezuela has changed its exchange control regulations in place that restrict our ability to convert local
currency into U.S. dollars, see Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risk related to doing business in Latin AmericaPolitical and economic conditions in Venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations.

 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar but our revenues are generated in the currencies of each
country where we operate. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies (i.e. the foreign currencies devaluate against the U.S. dollar), the economic value of our revenues in U.S. dollar terms will decline.
 We are subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Because we conduct our
business outside the United States and receive almost all of our revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies of certain
countries where we operate, including most notably Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela, have historically experienced significant devaluations. The results of operations in the countries where we operate are exposed to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, as occurred in previous years, the translation
of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the
foreign currencies of countries in which we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2012, 48.1% of our net revenues were denominated in Brazilian Reais, 23.7% in Argentine Pesos, 14.6% in Venezuelan Bolivares Fuertes, and 7.2% in Mexican
Pesos. The foreign currency exchange rates for the full year 2012 relative to 2011 resulted in higher net revenues of approximately $41.6 million and an increase in aggregate cost of net revenues and operating expenses of approximately
$30.1 million. The foreign currency exchange rates for the full year 2011 relative to 2010 resulted in lower net revenues of approximately $7.1 million and a decrease in aggregate cost of net revenues and operating expenses of
approximately $5.1 million. The abovementioned foreign currency exchange rate effect includes the Venezuelan translation effect discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  Critical accounting policies and estimates  Foreign Currency Translation. While we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, these are expensive, and in
addition it is very difficult to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure.  Exchange controls implemented
by the Argentine Government on the acquisition of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies could have material adverse impact in our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations 
The Argentine government has implemented certain measures that control and restrict the ability of companies and individuals to exchange
Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies. Those measures include, among other things, the requirement to obtain the prior approval from the Argentine Tax Authority of the foreign currency transaction (for example and without limitation, for the
payment of non-Argentine goods and services, payment of principal and interest on non-Argentine debt and also payment of dividends to parties outside of the country), which approval process could delay, and eventually restrict, the ability to
exchange Argentine pesos for other currencies, such as U.S. dollars. Those approvals are administered by the Argentine Central Bank through the MULC, which is the only market where exchange transactions may be lawfully made. Further, restrictions
also currently apply to the acquisition of any foreign currency for holding as cash within Argentina.  There can be no
assurance that the Central Bank of Argentina or other government agencies will not increase such controls or restrictions or make modifications to these regulations or establish more severe restrictions on currency exchange, making payments to
foreign creditors or providers, dividend payments to foreign shareholders or require its prior authorization for such purposes. As a result of these exchange controls and restrictions could materially adversely affect the business, financial
condition and results of operations of our Argentine subsidiary and could significantly impact our ability to comply our foreign currency obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our Company. 
Inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate, our
business and our operations.  Most Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation.
Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of Latin American countries. Governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future
actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most Latin American countries. The Latin American countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention
in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, particularly in Venezuela, which was determined to be
highly inflationary, and in Argentina, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures. A return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the
level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Developments in other markets
may affect the Latin American countries where we operate, our financial condition and results of operations.  The
market value of companies like us may be, to varying degrees, affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors perceptions of the events occurring in one
country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries, including Latin American countries. Various Latin American economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred
in several emerging economies in recent times, including Mexico in 1994, the collapse of several Asian economies between 1997 and 1998, the economic crisis in Russia in 1998, the Brazilian devaluations in January of 1999 and in 2002, the Argentine
crisis of 2001 and the market decline after September 11, 2001. Furthermore, Latin American economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy.

 Developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be
expected to adversely affect the economies of Latin American countries and therefore us.  E-commerce transactions in Latin America may
be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods.  Unlike in the United States, consumers and merchants in Latin
America can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third-party fraud. As secure methods of payment for e-commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in Latin America, both consumers and merchants generally have a
relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e-commerce transactions. In addition, many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns
about credit card fraud. Unless consumer fraud laws in Latin American countries are modified to protect e-commerce merchants and consumers, and until secure, integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region, our
ability to generate revenues from e-commerce may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.

 Risks related to our shares  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate substantially, and our stockholders investment may decline in value. 
The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, many of
which are beyond our control, including those described above under Risks related to our business.  Further,
the stock markets in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for Internet-related and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of these companies. We cannot assure you that trading prices and valuations will be sustained. These broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our
operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, such as recession or currency exchange rate fluctuations, may also adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, that company is often subject to securities class-action litigation. This kind of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
managements attention and resources, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in connection with the declaration
and payment of quarterly or special dividends on our common stock.  We continue to be significantly influenced by a group of
stockholders that control a significant percentage of our common stock and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected by any significant disposition of our shares by any of these stockholders. 
Certain stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, eBay owned approximately
8.1 million shares of our common stock (which represents 18.4% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2012). Certain members and certain entities affiliated with members of our management also hold a significant percentage of
our common stock. These stockholders retain the power to influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may conflict with, or differ from, the interests
of other holders of our common stock. For example, these stockholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock, sell revenue-generating assets or inhibit change of control
transactions that benefit other stockholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as these stockholders
continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock, they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our Company. 
Additionally, the actual sale, communication of an intention to sell or perceptions that any of the above mentioned stockholders may sell
any significant amount of our common stock could negatively impact the market value of our common stock.  Provisions of our certificate
of incorporation and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us, prevent a change of control, and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management. 
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not
approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. 
These provisions include:   


 

 
 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; 
 


 

 
 a staggered board of directors;   


 

 
 limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause; 
 


 

 
 limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and/or exercise voting power over 20% of our common stock; 
 


 

 
 limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our by-laws; 
 


 

 
 the inability of stockholders to act by written consent; 
 


 

 
 the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan; 
 


 

 
 the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines
and additional shares of our common stock; and   


 

 
 limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us, as provided under Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

Table of Contents

 These provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer or prevent
a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. See Description of capital stock for more information.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We may require additional capital in the future, and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. 
We may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion (organically or through strategic acquisitions), to develop
new or enhanced services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage
ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Additional financing may not be
available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our expansion, take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance
services or products or respond to competitive pressures. These inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. 
The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in
the future or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem
appropriate.  Certain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees beneficially own shares of
our common stock that have not been registered for resale with the SEC. The holders of these restricted shares may sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them, subject in the case of our affiliates, to certain
limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the SEC. Holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them.
 In the future, we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock issued
in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.  Our
stockholders may not receive dividends or dividends may not grow over time.  During 2012, the Company paid quarterly
dividends on shares of our common stock throughout the year. Although the Company announced its intention to pay regular quarterly dividends on shares of our common stock in the future, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and
our ability to pay dividends in the future may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described herein. All dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, our
financial condition and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our Board of Directors is under no obligation or requirement to declare a dividend. We cannot assure you that we will achieve results that will
allow us to pay a specified level of dividends, if any, or to grow our dividends over time.  Requirements associated with being a
public company require significant Company resources and management attention.  In connection with our initial public
offering, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market. We are also subject to various
other regulatory requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. If we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. As a result, our stockholders
could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm the trading price of our stock. In addition, in connection with our initial public offering in August 2007, we became subject to the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. Our
compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">It may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in U.S. courts. 
Although we are a Delaware corporation, our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the U.S. Furthermore, most of our
directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the U.S. As a result, you may not be able to enforce judgments against us or our directors or officers in U.S. courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of
U.S. federal securities laws. It is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the U.S. It is equally unclear if judgments entered by U.S. courts based on the
civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the U.S. Any enforcement action in a court outside the U.S. will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law, including
the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction.

ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  From
time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The number and significance of these disputes is increasing as our business expands and our company grows. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or
not, may be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources and require expensive implementations of changes to our business methods to respond
to these claims. See Item 1ARisk Factors for additional discussion of the litigation and regulatory risks facing our company.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December 31, 2012, our total reserves for proceeding-related contingencies were approximately $2.8 million to cover legal actions against the Company where we have determined that a loss is
probable. We do not reserve for losses we determine to be possible or remote.  As of December 31, 2012, there were 530
lawsuits pending against our Brazilian subsidiary in the Brazilian ordinary courts. In addition, as of December 31, 2012, there were more than 3,114 lawsuits pending against our Brazilian subsidiary in the Brazilian consumer courts, where a
lawyer is not required to file or pursue a claim. In most of these cases, the plaintiffs asserted that we were responsible for fraud committed against them, or responsible for damages suffered when purchasing an item on our website, when using
MercadoPago, or when we invoiced them. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims and intend to continue defending them.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Set forth below is a description of the legal proceedings that we have determined to be material to our business. We have excluded ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our business. In each of
these proceedings we also believe we have meritorious defenses, and intend to continue defending these actions. We have established a reserve for those proceedings which we have considered that a loss is probable. 
Litigation  On
November 5, 2003, Editora COC Empreendimentos Culturais Ltda., or Editora COC, sued MercadoLivre.com Atividades de Internet Ltda. (or MercadoLivre) in the 3rd Civil Court of the County of Bauru, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil.
Editora COC alleged that MercadoLivre and an identified user were both infringing Editora COCs trademarks as a result of the users selling allegedly pirated copies of Editoras COC CD-ROMs through the Brazilian page of the website,
based on Brazilian Industrial Property Law (Law 9,279/96) and the Brazilian Copyright Law (Law 9,610/98). Editora COC sought an order for the search and seizure of products held by the user and enjoining the sale of Editora COC-branded products on
MercadoLivres platform. An injunction was granted to prohibit the offer of Editora COCs products on the MercadoLivres platform. On September 8, 2005, the court ruled against MercadoLivre and held that it had to pay $3,000 and
its co-defendant had to pay $900 in moral damages, plus an amount of material damages to be defined at judgment execution, plus attorneys fees in the amount of 10% of the total damages paid by each defendant. On January 13, 2006
MercadoLivre appealed the ruling to the relevant court of appeals. On November, 18, 2010, the appeal was denied by the court of appeals. On December 3, 2010, MercadoLivre filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Appeals, which was also
denied. In May 2012, MercadoLivre paid R$10,370 for material damages plus R$19,672 for moral damages and the case was archived in December, 2012.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On March 17, 2006, Vintage Denim Ltda., or Vintage, sued Brazilian subsidiaries companies MercadoLivre and eBazar.com.br Ltda. (or eBazar) (together Brazilian subsidiaries) in
the 29th Civil Court of the County of S&atilde;o Paulo, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Vintage requested a preliminary injunction alleging that the Brazilian subsidiaries were infringing Diesel trademarks and their right of exclusive
distribution as a result of sellers listing allegedly counterfeit and original imported Diesel branded clothing through the Brazilian page of the Brazilian subsidiaries website, based on Brazilian Industrial Property Law (Law 9,279/96).
Vintage sought an order enjoining the sale of Diesel-branded clothing on the Brazilian subsidiaries platform. A preliminary injunction was granted on April 11, 2006 to prohibit the offer of Diesel-branded products, and a fine for
non-compliance was imposed in the approximate amount of $5,300 per defendant per day of non-compliance. The Brazilian subsidiaries appealed that fine and obtained its suspension in 2006. Because the appeal of the preliminary injunction failed,
in March of 2007, Vintage presented petitions alleging the Brazilian subsidiaries non-compliance with the preliminary injunction granted to Vintage and requested a fine of approximately $3.5 million against the Brazilian subsidiaries, which
represents approximately $5,300 per defendant per day of alleged non-compliance since April 2006. In July 2007, the judge ordered the payment of the fine mandated in the preliminary injunction, without specifying the amount. In September 2007, the
judge decided that (i) the Brazilian subsidiaries were not responsible for alleged infringement of intellectual property rights by its users; and that (ii) the plaintiffs did not prove the alleged infringement of its intellectual property
rights. However, the decision maintained the injunction until such ruling is non-appealable. The plaintiff appealed the judges ruling regarding the subsidiarys non-responsibility and the Brazilian subsidiaries appealed the decision that
maintained the preliminary injunction. On July 26, 2011 the State Court of Appeals of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo confirmed the judges ruling regarding our subsidiaries non-responsibility. The decision on the appeal regarding the
decision that maintained the preliminary injunction is still pending on the Superior Court. In the opinion of the Brazilian subsidiaries legal counsel, as of December 31, 2012, the amount of $3.5 million was not reserved since, $3.1 was
considered remote and $0.4 million was considered reasonably possible but not probable.  On April 6, 2006, Fallms
Distribuic&atilde;o de Fitas Ltda., or Fallms, and 100% Nacional Distribuidora de Fitas Ltda., or 100% Nacional, sued MercadoLivre in the Second Civil Court of Santo Amaro, County of S&atilde;o Paulo, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Fallms and
100% Nacional alleged that MercadoLivre was infringing their intellectual property rights as a result of users selling unauthorized copies of their copyrighted movies through the page of MercadoLivres website and by using their trademark
Brasileirinhas on such copies. Fallms and 100% Nacional sought an order enjoining the sale of Fallms, 100% Nacional and Brasileirinhas branded movies on the platform. An injunction was granted to prohibit the offer of Fallms,
100% Nacional and Brasileirinhas branded movies in the MercadoLivres website. In July, 2007, the judge revoked the preliminary injunction. On the same date, the judge decided that (i) MercadoLivre was not responsible for
alleged infringement of intellectual property rights by its users; and that (ii) the plaintiffs did not prove that (a) they own the trademark Brasileirinhas and copyrights of Brasileirinhas branded movies and
(b) the alleged infringement of intellectual property rights resulted in an effective copyright violation. On September 5, 2012 the Court of Appeals of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo confirmed the judges decision stating that
MercadoLivre was not responsible for alleged infringement of intellectual property rights by its users. Fallms did not appeal the decision and therefore the case was archived. In the opinion of the MercadoLivres management and its legal
counsel the risk of loss is remote.

 On March 7, 2007, Xuxa Promo&ccedil;&otilde;es e Produ&ccedil;&otilde;es
Art&iacute;sticas Ltda., or Xuxa, sued MercadoLivre in the Court of Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Xuxa, a popular television personality in Brazil, alleged that counterfeit copies of one of her CDs and of a movie
with her participation as an actress (for which she owns the copyright and distribution rights) are being sold on MercadoLivres platform, and as such MercadoLivre is infringing her intellectual and property rights. Xuxa seeks an injunction,
the establishment of preventive measures, fines, and compensatory and statutory damages. An injunction ordering the removal of any offers of copies of this CD and movie was granted to Xuxa. MercadoLivre presented its defense and appealed the

S.A., (or Serasa), sued MercadoLivre in the Sixth Civil Court of Santo Amaro, City of S&atilde;o Paulo, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Serasa, a company which provides credit-related analysis, information services and data bank and
payment habits related to individuals and corporations, alleged that MercadoLivre should be responsible for the sale by its users of allegedly unlawful content and unfair uses of its services and Serasas trade name and trademarks. Serasa seeks
an injunction, fines, and compensatory damages. On November 5, 2007 a preliminary injunction was granted to Serasa, ordering MercadoLivre (a) to remove any content offering: (i) consultation of Serasas database; and
(ii) passwords, texts or any material that promises to consult, remove or teach how to remove someone name from Serasas database; (b) to prohibit on the website any content similar to the aforementioned; and (c) to provide
certain personal data of certain users who have offered such products. In addition to the preliminary injunction, a fine of approximately $5,500 per day of noncompliance was imposed. On December 17, 2007, MercadoLivre presented the information
requested. The Company appealed the preliminary injunction to the State Court of S&atilde;o Paulo and presented the defense on January 7, 2008. Serasa replied to MercadoLivres appeal on January 30, 2008. On March 26, 2008,
MercadoLivre was summoned with a petition presented by Serasa alleging non-compliance with the injunction. MercadoLivre presented its response on March 31, 2008, arguing that it is in full compliance with the injunction. On August 26, 2008
the State Court of S&atilde;o Paulo lifted the prohibition to allow in the Brazilian website any content related to Serasa as established in the injunction but it was not appealed by the plaintiff. On June 5, 2009 the judge declared that
MercadoLivre shall not be held liable for the content posted by its users. Nonetheless, the sentence ordered MercadoLivre to remove certain contents related to the plaintiff. Serasa filed a motion for clarification of that decision, which was
rejected by the Judge. In July 2009, Serasa presented an appeal to the higher court. In August 2009 MercadoLivre presented the response to the appeal. The State Court of Appeals ruling is still pending. 
On November 23, 2007 Botelho Ind&uacute;stria e Distribui&ccedil;&atilde;o Cinematogr&aacute;fica Ltda., (or Botelho),
sued MercadoLivre in the Third Civil Court of the City of Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Botelho alleged that MercadoLivre was infringing its intellectual property rights as a result of users selling unauthorized copies of
Botelhos courses through the Brazilian website. Botelho seeks an injunction, fines, and compensatory and statutory damages, which was not yet analyzed by the judge. In February 2008, MercadoLivre presented arguments to give the judge support
and background to analyze the requested injunction. The Company presented its defense on March 5, 2008. A conciliation and settlement hearing was held on September 29, 2008, but no settlement was reached. On September 19, 2012, the
Lower Court Judge ruled in favor of MercadoLivre and dismissed the claims against MercadoLivre. Botelho appealed the decision on December 11, 2012. The Rio de Janeiro State Court of Appeals ruling is still pending. In the opinion of the
MercadoLivres management and its legal counsel the risk of loss is reasonably possible but not probable.  On
October 25, 2007, Iglesia Mesianica Mundial Sekai Kyusei Kio en la Argentina, (or Iglesia Mesianica), filed a suit against the Companys Argentine subsidiary, MercadoLibre S.A. (which changed its name legal to MercadoLibre
S.R.L.) (or MercadoLibre), in the Thirteenth Civil Court of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Iglesia Mesianica alleged in the complaint that MercadoLibre should be held liable as a result of users selling books that allegedly
plagiarized certain Iglesia Mesianicas books through the Argentine page of MercadoLibres website. Iglesia Mesianica seeks monetary damages in the amount of approximately $95,000. The Company presented its defense in May 2008 and also
filed a preliminary objection arguing the lack of jurisdiction of the Civil Court and requested that the case should be heard by a Federal Court instead. Iglesia Mesianica responded to the preliminary objection and the court rejected it in September
2010. On November 30, 2011 the court decided to begin with the evidence stage, and ordered the production of the parties evidence. As of the date of this annual report, according to the opinion of external legal counsel of the Company the
risk of loss of this case is remote.  On February 22, 2008, Nike International Ltd., (or Nike), requested a
preliminary injunction against the Companys Argentine subsidiary DeRemate.com de Argentina S.A. (or DeRemate), in the Court on Civil and Commercial Matters in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nike alleged that this subsidiary was
infringing Nike trademarks as a result of sellers listing allegedly counterfeit Nike branded products through the website www.deremate.com.ar. A preliminary injunction was granted in February 2008 to suspend the offer of Nike-branded products until
sellers could be properly identified. DeRemate appealed the decision. In November 2008, the Federal Court of Appeals on Civil and Commercial Matters lifted the prohibition to allow on the website of DeRemate any listing related to Nike branded
products subject to our requesting certain personal information from users listing those items. On March 25, 2008 Nike sued DeRemate in the same venue, for the same reasons argued in the request preliminary injunction. DeRemate presented its
defense on September 11, 2009. The courts ruling is still pending. As of the date of this report, according to the opinion of external legal counsel of DeRemate the risk of loss in this case is remote.

 On July 25, 2008, Nike requested a preliminary injunction against the Argentine
subsidiary MercadoLibre in the First Civil and Commercial Federal Court, Argentina. The Company was officially notified on August 14, 2008. Nike requested the injunction alleging that this subsidiary was infringing Nike trademarks as a result
of sellers listing allegedly counterfeit Nike branded products through MercadoLibres website. A preliminary injunction was granted on August 11, 2008 to suspend the offer of Nike-branded products until sellers could be properly
identified. MercadoLibre appealed the decision on August 22, 2008. On March 23, 2009 the Federal Court of Appeals on Civil and Commercial Matters, lifted the prohibition to allow in the Argentine website any listing related to Nike branded
products subject to our requesting certain personal information from users willing to list those items. On May 22, 2009, MercadoLibre was summoned about a lawsuit file by Nike against the Argentine subsidiary in the same venue, for the same
reasons argued in the request preliminary injunction. On May 27, 2009 MercadoLibre presented a preliminary objection requesting that Nike deposit as a security bond for costs. The court established that a bond for costs of approximately $3,500
should be deposited by Nike and both parties appealed this amount which was confirmed by the same Federal Court of Appeals. MercadoLibre presented its defense on April 21, 2010. As of the date of this report, according to the opinion of
external legal counsel of MercadoLibre the risk of loss in this case is remote.  On August 25, 2010, Citizen Watch do
Brasil S/A, or Citizen, sued Brazilian subsidiaries in the 31th Central Civil Court State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Citizen alleged that the Brazilian subsidiaries were infringing Citizens trademarks as a result of users selling allegedly
counterfeit Citizen watches through the Brazilian page of the Brazilian subsidiaries website. Citizen sought an order enjoining the sale of Citizen-branded watches on the Brazilian subsidiaries Marketplace with a $6,000 daily
non-compliance penalty. On September 23, 2010, the Brazilian subsidiaries were summoned of an injunction granted to prohibit the offer of Citizen products on its platform, but the penalty was established at $6,000. On September 26, 2010,
the Brazilian subsidiaries presented their defense and appealed the decision of the injunction relief on September 27, 2010. On October 22, 2010 the injunction granted to Citizen was suspended. On May 28, 2012, the Plaintiff filed an
appeal related to the injunction relief to the State Court of Appeals and the Brazilian subsidiaries presented their defense on August 16, 2012. The Superior courts ruling is still pending. In September 2012, The Plaintiff filed a legal
action against the Brazilian subsidiaries with same arguments alleged in the injunction request and seeking for compensatory and statutory damages. The Brazilian subsidiaries will present their defense. In the opinion of the Brazilian
subsidiaries management and its legal counsel the risk of loss is reasonably possible but not probable.  On
June 12, 2007, a state prosecutor of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil presented a claim against MercadoLivre The state prosecutor alleges that MercadoLivre should be held liable for any fraud committed by sellers on MercadoLivres
website, or responsible for damages suffered by buyers when purchasing an item on the Brazilian version of the MercadoLivre website. On June 26, 2009 the Lower Court Judge ruled in favor of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo prosecutor, declaring
that MercadoLivre shall be held joint and severally liable for fraud committed by sellers and damages suffered by buyers when using the website, and ordering MercadoLivre remove from the Terms of Service of the Brazilian website any provision
limiting MercadoLivres responsibility, with a penalty of approximately $2,500 per day of non-compliance. On June 29, 2009 the Company presented a recourse to the lower court, which was not granted. On September 29, 2009 MercadoLivre
presented an appeal and requested to suspend the effects of the ruling issued by the lower court until the appeal is decided by State Court of Appeals, which request was granted on December 1, 2009. The decision on the appeal is still pending.
In the opinion of MercadoLivres management and its legal counsel the risk of loss is reasonably possible.  On
August 19, 2011, a state prosecutor of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil presented a claim against MercadoLivre. The state prosecutor alleges that MercadoLivre should improve its customer service level and provide (among other things) a
telephone number for customer support and requested an injunction against our Brazilian subsidiary. On August 23, 2011, the Judge of the first instance court denied the aforementioned injunction. On December 7, 2011, MercadoLivre was
summoned for the lawsuit. On March 1, 2012 MercadoLivre presented its defense. On August 29, 2012 conciliatory hearing was taken, but no agreement was reached. On October 22, 2012, the Lower Court Judges ruled in favor of MercadoLivre
and dismissed the claim against MercadoLivre. The Public Prosecutor appealed the decision and MercadoLivre presented its defense on December 12, 2012. In the opinion of the MercadoLivres management and its legal counsel the risk of loss
is remote.  In 2007 S&atilde;o Paulo tax authorities have asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary relating
to the period from 2005 to 2007 in an approximate amount of $5.9 million according to the exchange rate in effect at that time. In 2007, the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities claim and the tax authorities ruled
against the Brazilian subsidiary. In 2009, the Company presented an appeal to the Conselho Municipal de Tributos or S&atilde;o Paulo Municipal Council of Taxes which reduced the fine. On February 11, 2011, the Company appealed this decision to
the C&acirc;maras Reunidas do Egr&eacute;gio Conselho Municipal de Tributos or Superior Chamber of the S&atilde;o Paulo Municipal Council of Taxes which affirmed the reduction of the fine. As of the date of these financial statements, the total
amount of the claim is approximately $5.8 million including surcharges and interest. With this decision the administrative stage is finished. On August 15, 2011, the Company made a deposit in court of approximately R$ 9.5 million, which
including accrued interests amounted to R$ 10.4 million or $5.1 million, according to the exchange rate at December 31, 2012, and filed a lawsuit in 8th Public Treasury Court of the County of S&atilde;o Paulo, State of S&atilde;o Paulo,
Brazil, to contest the taxes and fines asserted by the Tax Authorities. The 8th Public Treasury Court of the County of S&atilde;o Paulo ruling is still pending.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In June 2012 S&atilde;o Paulo tax authorities have asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary related to our Brazilian subsidiarys activities in S&atilde;o Paulo for the period from
2007 through 2010 in an approximate amount of R$23 million or $11.3 million according to the exchange rate as of December 31, 2012. On July 27, 2012 the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities claim. The
S&atilde;o Paulo tax authorities ruling is still pending.  In January 2005 the Brazilian subsidiary moved its operations to
Santana de Parna&iacute;ba City, Brazil and began paying taxes to that jurisdiction and therefore we believe we have strong defenses to the claims of the S&atilde;o Paulo authorities with respect to these periods. The Companys management and
its legal counsel believe that the risk of loss is remote, and as a result, has not reserved any provisions for these claims from 2005 through 2010.

defenses against the authorities claim and on July 25, 2012 it was reduced to R$1.5 million or $ 0.7 million, according to the exchange rate as of December 31, 2012. On August 24, 2012 MercadoLivre presented its appeal to
the Board of Tax Appeals (CARF)Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais against the tax authorities claims. The decision on the appeal is still pending. MercadoLivres management and its legal counsel believe that the risk of

tax authority of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina has asserted taxes and fines against MercadoLibre, relating to the Sales Tax for the period 2007-2011 in an approximate amount of AR$3.45 million or $0.7 million, according to the exchange rate as
of December 31, 2012. On September 13, 2011 the Company presented administrative recourses against the tax authorities claim. The Companys management and its legal counsel believe that the risk of loss is possible, and as a
result, the Company has not reserved any provisions for this claim.  On September 1, 2010, a state prosecutor of the State of
So Paulo, Brazil presented a claim against the Companys Brazilian subsidiary. The state prosecutor alleges that the Brazilian subsidiary should improve its customer service level and provide (among other things) a telephone number for
customer support. On November 17, 2010, the Judge of the first instance court granted an injunction against the Brazilian subsidiary imposing the obligation to provide customer service over telephone means within 60 days with a penalty of
approximately $65,000 per day of non-compliance. On April 8, 2011, the Company was summoned of the lawsuit and the injunction. On April 14, 2011, the Company presented recourse to the lower court; even though, the injunction was not lifted, an
extension of 30 days was granted, and the non-compliance fine would not start running until July 11, 2011. On April 20, 2011 the Company presented an appeal and requested to suspend the effects of the injunction issued by the lower court until the
appeal is decided by State Court of Appeals which was granted on May 4, 2011. On November 29, 2011, the state prosecutor signed an agreement with the Brazilian subsidiary and presented a motion for dismissal of the case. On January 16, 2012,
Instituto Bar&atilde;os de Mau&aacute; de Defesa de Vitimas e Consumidores contra Entes Poluidores e Maus Fornecedores or The Instituto Bar&atilde;o de Mau&aacute;, a consumer protection entity which had joined the case as a co-plaintiff, presented
a petition manifesting its partial disagreement with the commitments assumed by the Company. On March 22, 2012, the Lower Court Judge ruled in favor of the agreement and dismissed the claim against the Company. The Instituto Bar&atilde;o de
Mau&aacute; did not appeal the decision, therefore the case is closed.  Intellectual Property Claims 
In the past third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual
property rights. We have been notified of several potential third-party claims for intellectual property infringement through our website. These claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming, can be costly to resolve, could cause service
upgrade delays, and could require expensive implementations of changes to our business methods to respond to these claims. See Item 1A Risk factorsRisks related to our businessWe could potentially face legal and financial liability
for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and for information disseminated on the MercadoLibre Marketplace.

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance  To supplement the Companys consolidated
financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), MercadoLibre monitors free cash flows as a non-GAAP measure of certain components of financial performance. 
This non-GAAP measures is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP
measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
MercadoLibres results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. This measure should only be used to evaluate MercadoLibres results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. 
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure can be found in the table included below, in this section. 
Non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors overall understanding of the Companys current financial performance and the
Companys prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding payment for the acquisition of property, equipment, intangible assets and businesses net
of cash acquired, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we report Free Cash Flows on our earnings release, we believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP measure provides consistency in
our financial reporting.  Free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less payment for the acquisition of property, equipment and
intangible assets and businesses net of cash acquired. MercadoLibre considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the
purchases of property, and equipment, of intangible assets and of businesses net of cash acquired, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in MercadoLibres business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation
of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the Companys cash balance for the year.

 Overview  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">MercadoLibre, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries us, we, our or the Company) hosts the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America located at
www.mercadolibre.com, which is focused on enabling e-commerce and its related services. Our services are designed to provide our users with mechanisms for buying, selling, paying, collecting, generating leads and comparing listings via
e-commerce transactions in an effective and efficient manner. We are market leaders in e-commerce in each of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, based on unique visitors and page views during
2012. Additionally, we operate e-commerce platforms in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Portugal.  Through our e-commerce
platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust e-commerce environment that fosters the development of a large and growing e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 584 million people and one of the
fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. We believe that we offer a technological and commercial solution that addresses the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America.
 We offer our users an eco-system of four related e-commerce services: the MercadoLibre Marketplace, the MercadoPago payments
solution, the MercadoClics advertising solution and the MercadoShops on-line stores solution.  The MercadoLibre Marketplace,
which we sometimes refer to as our marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly e-commerce service. This service permits both businesses and individuals to list items and conduct their sales and purchases online in either
a fixed-price or auction-based format. Additionally, through online classified listings, our registered users can list and purchase motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services. Any Internet user can browse through the various
products and services that are listed on our web site and register with MercadoLibre to list, bid for and purchase items and services.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution. MercadoPago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre
Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely, easily and promptly send, receive and finance payments online.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As a further enhancement to the MercadoLibre Marketplace, in 2009, we launched our MercadoClics program to allow businesses to promote their products and services on the Internet. Through MercadoClics
users and advertisers are able to place display and/or text advertisements on our web pages in order to promote their brands and offerings. MercadoClics offers advertisers a cost efficient and automated platform through which it will acquire
traffic. Advertisers purchase, on a cost per clicks basis, advertising space that appear around product search results for specific categories and other pages. These advertising placements are clearly differentiated from product search results and
direct traffic both to and off our platform based on the advertisers destination of choice.  To close out our suite of
e-commerce services we launched, during 2010, the MercadoShops on-line stores solution. Through MercadoShops users can set-up, manage and promote their own on-line webstores. These webstores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the
other marketplace, payments and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and added services on their stores. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in October 1999 and introduced web sites in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay and
Venezuela by April 2000. In order to build a critical mass of users, we initially offered our services free of charge in all of these markets.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In May 2000, we obtained significant financing and reached gross merchandise volume of $14.3 million. In 2001, we launched a new version of our site and brand and launched our operations in
Ecuador. Our gross merchandise volume for the year ended December 31, 2001 grew to $21.3 million. Our gross merchandise volume reached $55.4 million for 2002, $164.3 million for 2003 and $299.3 million for 2004. In November
of 2005, we acquired certain operations of DeRemate.com, Inc. and our gross merchandise volume reached $607.7 million. During 2006, we launched sites in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Panama, and our gross merchandise volume reached
$1,075.1 million. Our gross merchandise volume was $1,511.5 million for 2007.  In August 2007, we completed our
initial public offering through which 16,077,185 shares of our common stock were sold at a initial public offering price of $18.00 per share less an underwriting discount of 4.5%. Out of that total, 2,608,696 shares of common stock were sold by us
and 13,468,489 were sold by selling shareholders. We, along with certain shareholders, granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from August 9, 2007, to purchase up to 2,411,577 additional shares at the public offering
price less the underwriting discount. The option was exercised in full, and of that total, an additional 391,304 shares were sold by us and 2,020,273 were sold by the selling shareholders. 
In January 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Classified Media Group, Inc., or CMG, and
its subsidiaries. CMG and its subsidiaries operate an online classified advertisements platform primarily dedicated to the sale of vehicles at www.tucarro.com in Venezuela, Colombia and Puerto Rico and real estate at www.tuinmueble.com in Venezuela,
Colombia, Panama, the United States, Costa Rica and the Canary Islands. On the acquisition date, we paid $19 million subject to certain escrows and working capital adjustment clauses. On June 27, 2008, the Company released to the former
CMG shareholders $1.9 millions in full satisfaction of the management escrow. On January 22, 2009, we released the escrow balance of $1.1 million to the sellers of CMG.

Table of Contents

 In September 2008, we completed the acquisition of DeRemate.com de Argentina S.A.,
DeRemate.com Chile S.A., Interactivos y Digitales M&eacute;xico S.A. de C.V. and Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Negocios Interactiva de Colombia E.U. for an aggregate purchase price of $37.6 million. We also purchased certain URLs, domains,
trademarks, databases and intellectual property rights related to those businesses for $2.4 million. On February 12, 2009, the purchase price allocation period ended and we agreed with the sellers to a working capital adjustment of
$480,912 to be paid by the sellers to us.  In September 2011, the Company acquired 60% of outstanding membership interest of
Autopark LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware with 100% ownership of AP Clasificados, an online classified advertisements platform in Mexico primarily dedicated to the sale of vehicles at www.autoplaza.com.mx and
real estate at www.homeshop.com.mx. The aggregate purchase price paid in cash was $5.5 million and includes URLs, domain names, trademarks, databases non-compete agreements and intellectual property rights that are used or useful in connection
with the online platforms of the acquired business.  Reporting Segments 
Our segment reporting is based on geographic areas, which is the current criteria we are using to evaluate our segment performance. Our
geography segments include Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela and other countries (including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Portugal and Uruguay). 
In addition, we operate a real estate classifieds platform that covers some areas of Florida in the United States, the operations of
which are included in our segment for other countries.  For 2012, our net revenues were $373.6 million. Of
those net revenues, approximately 48.1% was attributable to our Brazilian businesses, 23.7% to our Argentine businesses, 14.6% to our Venezuelan businesses, 7.2% to our Mexican businesses and 6.4% to our businesses in other countries. Although we
discuss long-term trends in our business, it is our policy to not provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense. We believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near-term results difficult. Further, we seek to make decisions
focused primarily on the long-term welfare of our Company and believe focusing on short term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders. We believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for
long-term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value. We, therefore, encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock. A long-term focus may make it more difficult for industry
analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our Company, which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short term tactics to grow stronger than us.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Description of line items  Net revenues 
We recognize net revenues in each of our five reporting segments. Our reporting segments include our operations in Brazil, Argentina,
Mexico, Venezuela and other countries (Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Portugal and Uruguay).  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We offer three listing types of up-front fees for three different combinations of placement and features. Up-front fees are charged at the time the listing is uploaded onto our platform and are not
subject to successful sale of the items listed. Since the third quarter of 2009, revenues for the MercadoLibre Marketplace transactions are now generated by:   


 

 
 up-front fees (including classifieds revenues);   


 

 
 final value fees; and   


 

 
 online advertising fees. 
Since the third quarter of 2010, we have offered payment processing through our MercadoPago solution at no added cost in Brazil and Argentina. On
April 15, 2011 and November 10, 2011, we launched a new and improved version of our MercadoPago payments platform that may be used for all our marketplace transactions in Mexico and Venezuela, respectively. We also made offering
MercadoPago mandatory in our Mexican, and recently in our Venezuelan, marketplace listings (with the exception of free listings). This change in pricing results, with respect to marketplace transactions, in our no longer charging our users a
specific fee for processing on-platform payments as we did in the past. When more than one service is included in one single arrangement with the customer, we recognize revenue according to multiple element arrangements accounting, distinguishing
between each of the services provided and allocating revenues based on their respective selling prices. 
   45 





Table of Contents

 We continue generating payment related revenues, reported within each of our reporting
segments, attributable to:   


 

 
 commissions charged to sellers for the use of the MercadoPago platform with respect to transactions that occur outside of our marketplace platform;
  


 

 
 revenues from a financial charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our MercadoPago platform, for transactions that occur on or off of
our marketplace platform.  Prior to the third quarter of 2009, we used to generate revenues from the
MercadoLibre Marketplace transactions from:   


 

listing fees (including classifieds revenues);   


 

optional feature fees;   


 

final value fees; and   


 

on-line advertising fees. 
During the third quarter of 2009, we modified our pricing structure by replacing our previous listing fees and optional feature fees with
consolidated up-front fees which bundle these features, as discussed above.  The following table sets forth the percentage of
consolidated net revenues by country for each of 2012, 2011 and 2010:

 We have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our
platforms. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 5.0% of our net revenues. Our MercadoLibre Marketplace is available in 13 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,

 Cost of net revenues  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Cost of net revenues primarily represents bank and credit card processing charges for transactions and fees paid with credit cards and other payment methods, certain taxes on revenues, compensation for
customer support personnel, ISP connectivity charges, depreciation and amortization and hosting and site operation fees.  Product and
technology development expenses  Our product and technology development related expenses consist primarily of
depreciation and amortization costs related to product and technology development, compensation for our engineering and web-development staff, telecommunications costs and payments to third-party suppliers who provide technology maintenance services
to our Company.  Sales and marketing expenses  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs for our platforms through online and offline advertising, chargebacks, bad debt charges, the salaries of employees involved in these
activities, public relations costs, marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization costs.  We carry out
the vast majority of our marketing efforts on the Internet. In that context, we enter into agreements with portals, search engines, social networks, ad networks and other sites in order to attract Internet users to the MercadoLibre Marketplace and
convert them into confirmed registered users and active traders on our platform. Additionally, we allocate a portion of our marketing budget to cable television advertising in order to improve our brand awareness and to complement our online
efforts.  We also work intensively on attracting, developing and growing our seller community through our supply efforts. We
have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers, through trade show participation, seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform. 
General and administrative expenses  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for management and administrative staff, compensation for outside directors, long term retention plan compensation, expenses for
legal, accounting and other professional services, insurance expenses, office space rental expenses, travel and business expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization costs. General and administrative expenses include the costs of the following
areas of our Company: general management, finance, administration, accounting, legal and human resources.  Other income (expenses), net
 Other income (expenses) consists of interest income derived primarily from our investments and cash equivalents,
foreign currency gains or losses, and other non-operating results. Prior to the third quarter of 2010, other income (expenses) included mainly interest expense related to the working capital requirements for our MercadoPago operations. Since
the third quarter of 2010 and for as long as we continue pre-selling credit card receivables there has been, and we expect in the future will be, no interest expense included in other income (expenses) line, related to MercadoPagos
working capital requirements.  Income and asset tax  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States, as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate. Our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes
and asset taxes incurred in these jurisdictions. We account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting. Therefore, our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any (given that in certain jurisdictions we still
have net operating loss carry-forwards), plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 Seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue
to affect, our business. Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the Christmas season. Our slowest period is typically the first quarter of
the year. The months of January, February and March normally correspond to summer vacation time in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Additionally, the Easter holiday falls in March or April, and Brazil celebrates Carnival for one week in
February or March. This is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere, such as Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela for which the slowest months are their summer months of July, August and September.

 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our management has discussed the development,
selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and our board of directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters
that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. You should read the following
descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in with this report. 
Foreign currency translation  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Historically, all of our foreign operations have used the local currency as their functional currency. Accordingly, these foreign subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies
to U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as part of other comprehensive income (loss), a component
of shareholders equity. Gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non-functional currencies are recognized in earnings. Net foreign currency exchange losses or gains are included in the consolidated statements of income under
the caption Foreign currency gain /(loss).  Until September 30, 2009, our Venezuelan subsidiaries assets,
liabilities, income and expenses were translated at the official Venezuelan exchange rate of 2.15 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to use the parallel exchange rate (as described below) rather than the official exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan financial statements. The following facts
and circumstances have been considered in our analysis of the applicable exchange rate:   


 

At the date we changed the translation exchange rate (and as of the date of this report), we have not obtained dividends remittances at the official exchange
rate (and we have not at the date of this report);   


 

The industry in which we operate may not influence our ability to access to the official exchange rate; 
 


 

The CADIVI volume of approvals of the use of the Official Rate was down 50% on a year-to-year basis as of July 2009; and 
 


 

CADIVI has not only delayed approvals but also removed many items from priority lists (current priorities appear to be food and medicine) causing delays in the
repatriation of dividends for many companies.  Consequently, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we translated our
Venezuelan subsidiaries assets, liabilities, income and expense accounts using the parallel exchange rate.  As of the
date of this report the Company did not buy dollars at the CADIVI official rate.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have
classified our Venezuelan operations as highly inflationary as of January 1, 2010 and have used the U.S. dollar to be the functional currency for purposes of our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect was accounted for in other
comprehensive income since October 1, 2009 related to our Venezuelan operations.  Until May 13, 2010, the only way
by which U.S. dollars could be purchased outside the official currency market was using an indirect mechanism consisting in the purchase and sale of securities, including national public debt bonds (DPNs) denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and bonds
issued by the Venezuelan government that were denominated in US dollars. This mechanism for transactions in certain securities created an indirect parallel foreign currency exchange market in Venezuela that enabled entities to obtain
foreign currency through financial brokers without going through CADIVI. Although the parallel exchange rate was higher, and accordingly less beneficial, than the official exchange rate, some entities have used the parallel market to
exchange currency because, as previously mentioned, CADIVI has typically failed to approve in a timely manner the exchange of currency requested by such entities. Until May 13, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiaries used this mechanism to buy U.S.
dollars and accordingly we used the parallel average exchange rate to re-measure those foreign currency transactions. 
   49 





Table of Contents

 However, on May 14, 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange
regulations and closed down such parallel market by declaring that foreign-currency-denominated securities issued by Venezuelan entities were included in the definition of foreign currency, thus making the Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) the only
institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds, thereby excluding non-authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Trading of foreign currencies was re-opened as a regulated market on June 9, 2010 with the Venezuelan Central Bank as the only institution through which foreign currency-denominated transactions can
be brokered. Under the new system, known as the Foreign Currency Securities Transactions System (SITME), entities domiciled in Venezuela can buy U.S. dollardenominated securities only through banks authorized by the BCV to import goods,
services or capital inputs. Additionally, the SITME imposes volume restrictions on an entitys trading activity, limiting such activity to a maximum equivalent of $50,000 per day, not to exceed $350,000 in a calendar month. This limitation is
non-cumulative, meaning that an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next.  As a consequence,
commencing on June 9, 2010, we have transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the SITME rate and started re-measuring foreign currency transactions using the SITME rate published by BCV, which was 5.27 Bolivares Fuertes per
U.S. dollar as of June 9, 2010.  For the period beginning on May 14, 2010 and ended on June 8, 2010 (during
which there was no open foreign currency markets), we applied U.S. GAAP guidelines, which state that if exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date, the first subsequent rate at
which exchanges could be made shall be used.  Accordingly, the June 9, 2010 exchange rate published by the VCB has been
used to re-measure transactions during the above-mentioned period.  During 2010 and previous years we were able to obtain U.S.
dollars using alternative mechanisms other than the CADIVI. These dollars, obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by CADIVI, and held in balance at U.S. bank accounts of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, were used for dividend
distributions from our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As a result, during 2010, lack of CADIVI approval did not restrict our ability to distribute the full amount of our retained earnings as dividends related to fiscal years 2008 ($0.8 million), and
2009 ($1.8 million). In addition, during 2011, our Venezuelan subsidiaries distributed dividends of a $4.2 million, related to earnings for fiscal year 2010, using existing cash balances held in the U.S. bank accounts of our Venezuelan
subsidiaries. No dividends were declared during the year ended December 31, 2012.  The following table sets forth net
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and assets, liabilities and net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, before intercompany eliminations, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011:

 Net assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 of our Venezuelan operations amounted to approximately
13.9% and 9.3%, respectively, of our consolidated net assets. Cash and investments as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 of our Venezuelan operations held in local currency in Venezuela amounted to approximately 15.5% and 7.6%, respectively, of our
consolidated cash and investments.  On June 2, 2011, our Venezuelan subsidiary acquired an office property containing 992
square meters in a building located in Caracas, Venezuela for approximately $6.6 million. The Company funded the purchase price through working capital.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On February 8, 2013, the Government of Venezuela, through the Foreign Exchange Agreement No. 14, has devaluated as from February 9, 2013, the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3
Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollars. The devaluation did not have an effect on the 2012 consolidated financial statements; however, the devaluation will require remeasurement of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar
denominated monetary assets and liabilities as from February 9, 2013. 
   50 





Table of Contents

 In addition, on February 8, 2013, the Government of Venezuela, through Decree
No. 9381 (the Decree) has created the Organo Superior para la Optimizaci&oacute;n del Sistema Cambiario (or the Committee), a committee that will have the authority to design, plan and execute foreign exchange policies.
At the date of this consolidated financial statements, the Committee created by the Decree, is under the process of being designated.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Finally, on February 9, 2013, the Central Bank of Venezuela has eliminated the SITME, which was former system that the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries had for accessing to the foreign exchange
market described in Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policiesVenezuelan currency status. Had the devaluation occurred on December 31, 2012, and had been 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollars the exchange rate at which
the Company could have had access to the foreign exchange market, the Company would have recorded a translation loss of approximately $ 5.7 million on its year-end consolidated financial statements, considering the non-U.S. dollar denominated
monetary assets and liabilities of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries as of that date.  Despite the increasing
restrictions on the ability of our Venezuelan subsidiaries to obtain U.S. dollars for the purpose of distributing dividends to us or our other subsidiaries, we do not expect that the current restrictions, will have a material adverse effect on our
business plans, in Venezuela or on our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill 
We review long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to its undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. If such asset is considered to be
impaired on this basis, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of
impairment loss, if any. No impairments were recognized during the reporting periods and managements assessment of each reporting units fair value materially exceeds its carrying value. 
Goodwill and certain indefinite life trademarks are reviewed for impairment at each year-end or more frequently when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill and certain trademarks are tested at the reporting unit level (considering each segment of the Company as a reporting unit) by comparing the reporting
units carrying amount, including goodwill and certain trademarks, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company adopted the new guidance to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life and, as a consequence, we may perform
a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or such intangible assets are
less than their carrying amount, the fair-value based test is applied. For the year ended December 31, 2012, based on the quantitative assessment, the Company determined that the fair value of all the reporting units and the intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are greater than their carrying amount.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, the fair
values of the reporting units and the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach. Cash flow projections used were based on financial budgets approved by
management. The growth rates applied do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the reporting unit operates. The Company uses discount rates to each reporting unit in the range of 10% to 18%. The average discount rate
used for 2012 was 11.4%. That rate reflected the Companys real weighted average cost of capital. Key drivers in the analysis include Confirmed Registered Users (CRUs), Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) which represents a
measure of the total U.S. dollar amount of all transactions completed through the MercadoLibre Marketplace, excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate, and services and take rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of gross
merchandise volume. In addition, the benchmark in the analysis includes a business to e-commerce rate, which represents the growth of e-commerce as a percentage of GDP, internet penetration rates as well as trends in the Companys market share.
 If the carrying amount of any given reporting unit or any intangible asset with indefinite useful life exceeds its fair
value, goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. No impairments were recognized during the reporting periods included in the
financial statements set forth in Item 8 and managements assessment of each reporting unit fair value materially exceeds its carrying value.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets and goodwill is critical since it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because: (i) it requires
management to make assumptions about gross merchandise volume growth, future interest rates, sales and costs; and (ii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net income
would be material. Managements assumptions about future sales and future costs require significant judgment.  Allowance for
doubtful accounts and provision for chargebacks  We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to
sellers. Allowances for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience. The allowance for doubtful accounts and for chargebacks is recorded as a charge to sales and marketing expenses. Historically, our actual
losses have been consistent with provisions. In addition, we write-off acounts receivable when it becomes 181 days overdue. However, future adverse changes to our historical experience for doubtful accounts and chargebacks could have a material
impact on our future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. We are also exposed to losses due to credit card fraud and other payment misuse. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical
experience, as well as economic conditions. 
   52 





Table of Contents

 We believe that the estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for
chargebacks are critical accounting estimates since it requires management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis. Our managements assumptions about future collections require significant judgment. 
Legal Contingencies  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our condensed consolidated statement of income.
These estimates are based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances and historical information related to actions filed against the Company at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.
 From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved in
certain legal proceedings as discussed in BusinessLegal Proceedings, and in Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we will defend
ourselves accordingly. However, even if successful, our defense could be costly and could divert managements time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay material damages or modify our business
practices. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Income taxes  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon taxable income and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions
in which we operate. This process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws in each jurisdiction and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, including various
accruals, allowances, depreciation and amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated
balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized,
we establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2012, we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the
extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our Income/asset tax expense line in our consolidated statement of income.

on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The fluctuations in the valuation allowance will depend on the capacity of each country operation to generate taxable income or our execution of
future tax planning strategies that allow us to use the aforementioned deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our
tax provision in our consolidated statement of income.  During the year ended December 31, 2012, we have reduced $0.2
million related to valuation allowance of certain subsidiaries, acquired in 2008. In addition, during that same year, we increased our valuation allowance in our Argentine operation by $0.6 million as a consequence of our assessment of the
recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in such jurisdiction.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, we have
reversed $2.0 million related to certain valuation allowance in one of our Brazilian subsidiaries, acquired in 2001, as a consequence of a business reorganization in that country, The reversal of the tax valuation allowance was based on the
assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.  During the year ended

Table of Contents

 As of December 31, 2012, there are $137.8 million of non-U.S. subsidiaries
undistributed earnings. In determining the amount of non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings, we do not consider a portion of the non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2012 to be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes because our strategy is to reinvest our undistributed earnings of our foreign operations in those operations and to distribute dividends when they can be offset with available tax credits. We do not expect a material impact in
any repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries on our operations since the taxable domestic gains generated by any dividend distributions will be mostly offset with foreign tax credits that arise from income tax paid in our
foreign operations, which we are allowed to compute for domestic income tax purposes. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if such distribution exceeds available
foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  <FONT

 Our effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, are 28.1%.
27.5% and 30.8%, respectively. Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we
have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting
principles.  Stock-based compensation  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On August 8, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a four year employee retention program (the 2008 LTRP) payable 50% in cash and 50% in shares, subject to certain performance conditions
which were satisfied. Subject to an employees continued employment as of the applicable payment date, the vesting schedule for awards under the 2008 LTRP is as follows: 
 


 

Year One  Paid on or before March 31, 2009: 17% (8.5% in cash and 8.5% in common stock); 
 


 

Year Two  Paid on or before March 31, 2010: 22% (11% in cash and 11% in common stock); 
 


 

Year Three  Paid on or before March 31, 2011: 27% (13.5% in cash and 13.5% in common stock); and 
 


 

Year Four  Paid on or before March 31, 2012: 34% (17% in cash and 17% in common stock). 
The compensation cost is recognized in accordance with the graded-vesting attribution method and is accrued up to each payment date.
 The total compensation cost of the 2008 LTRP amounts to approximately $1.6 million, including cash and shares. The 21,591
shares to be issued in the four years of the 2008 LTRP were valued at the grant-date fair market value of $36.80 per share. 
On July 15, 2009, June 25, 2010, August 1, 2011 and June 5, 2012, the Board of Directors, upon the
recommendation of the Compensation Committee approved the 2009, the 2010, the 2011 and the 2012 employee retention programs (the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP), respectively. The awards under the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP are fully
payable in cash in addition to the annual salary and bonus of each employee.  The 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP will be paid
in 8 equal annual installments (12.5% each) commencing on March 31, 2010, March 31, 2011, March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively. Each quota is calculated as follows: 
 


 

6.25% of the amount will be calculated in nominal terms (the nominal basis share), 
 


 

6.25% is adjusted by multiplying the nominal amount by the average closing stock price for the last 60 trading days of the year previous to the payment date and divided
by the average closing stock price for the last 60 trading days of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP, respectively. The average closing stock price for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP was $13.81, $45.75, $65.41 and
$77.77, respectively (the variable share).

Table of Contents

 All 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP have performance and/or eligibility conditions to be
achieved at each year end and also require the employee to be still employed in the Company at the payment date.  The variable
share compensation cost of the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP are recognized in accordance with the graded-vesting attribution method and are accrued up to each payment date. The 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP nominal basis share are recognized in
straight line bases using the equal annual accrual method.

 On June 25, 2010, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee of
our board, adopted the 2010 Director Compensation Program (the 2010 Director Plan) for outside directors. Under the terms of the 2010 Director Plan, starting in 2011, each outside director is entitled to receive the following
compensation for services provided as a director of the Company:   


 

 
 an annual fixed cash retainer for service on the board (the Fixed Retainer); 
 


 

 
 an annual fixed cash retainer for service as chairman of the audit committee (the Audit Chairman Retainer), compensation committee (the
Compensation Chairman Retainer), nominating and corporate governance committee (the Nominating Chairman Retainer) and lead independent director (the Lead Director Retainer), as applicable; and
  


 

 
 an annual variable cash retainer based upon the change in our stock price from year to year (the Variable Retainer).
 The amount of the Variable Retainer payable in any year is determined by multiplying the target Variable
Retainer award amount (the Target Variable Retainer) for such year by the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Prior Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the Current
Year Stock Price (as defined below). For purposes of the 2010 Director Plan, the Applicable Year Stock Price shall equal the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the 30 trading day period preceding
the date of the annual stockholders meeting held in the year the payment is made and the Prior Year Stock Price shall equal the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the 30 trading day period
preceding the date of our annual stockholders meeting held in the year prior to the year in which the payment is made.  Under
the terms of the 2010 Director Plan, each outside director received or will receive an annual fee for services provided to the Company for the periods from June 10, 2010 through June 9, 2011, from June 10, 2011 through June 9,
2012 and from June 10, 2012 through June 9, 2013, payable as follows: (a) a non-adjustable board service award (Non-Adjustable Board Service Award) which means a fixed cash payment of $32,436, 37,703 and $43,826,
respectively and (b) an Adjustable Award (the Adjustable Award) which means a fixed cash amount of $43,248, $50,271 and $58,435, respectively, multiplied by the average closing sale price of the Companys common stock during
the last 30-trading day period as of the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders divided by the average closing sale price of the Companys common stock during the last 30-trading day period as of the date of the prior years
annual meeting of stockholders. The 2010 Director Plan also included a Non-Adjustable Chairman Service Award for services provided to the Company for such periods. Under the terms of the 2010 Director Plan, the Chairman of the Companys Audit
Committee, of the Compensation Committee, of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the lead independent director of the Company are entitled to receive annual cash compensation in addition to the existing director compensation for
the period from June 10, 2010 through June 9, 2011 equal $16,218, $12,974, $5,406 and $10,812, respectively. For the period from June 9, 2011 through June 9, 2012 the Non-Adjustable Chairman Service Award amounted to $18,852,
$15,081, $6,284 and $12,568, respectively. For the period from June 9, 2012 through June 9, 2013 the Non-Adjustable Chairman Service Award amounted to $21,913, $17,531, $7,304 and $14,609, respectively. 
The total accrued compensation cost for the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was the following:

 Stock option awards granted under the Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock
Plan, (the 1999 Plan) are at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and may be in the form of either incentive or nonqualified stock options. Outstanding options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest over a
four year period and expire ten years after the date of grant. As of December 31, 2012, there were 270,099 shares of common stock available for additional awards under the 1999 Plan.

Table of Contents

 Stock options are accounted for at their grant date fair value. Fair value of stock options
was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This calculation was affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. The use of a Black-Scholes model
requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. As a result, the future stock-based compensation expense may
differ from historical amounts.  Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $nil, $nil and $244, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated portion of the awards that are expected to vest. 
As of December 31, 2012, all stock-based compensation expense related to stock options has been recognized. 
No stock options were granted during the period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012.

 Recent accounting pronouncements  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the Accounting Standard Update No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. The amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts
reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that
are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. For public entities, the
amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this pronouncement as from fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. Management estimates that
the implementation of the new accounting guidance will not have significant effect on the Companys financial statements.  Results of

 Principal trends in results of operations 
Growth in net revenues from year to year  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Since our inception, we have consistently generated revenue growth from our MercadoLibre Marketplace and from MercadoPago, driven by the strong growth of our key operational metrics. From 2011 to 2012,
our gross merchandise volume increased by 18.3%, our successful items sold increased by 27.6% and MercadoPago total payment volume increased by 36.2%. From 2010 to 2011, our gross merchandise volume increased by 41.5%, our successful items sold
increased by 34.6% and MercadoPago total payment volume increased by 88.1%. Our growth in net revenues was 25.0% from 2011 to 2012 and 37.9% from 2010 to 2011. We believe that the growth in net revenues should continue in the future. However,
despite this positive historical trend, current weak global macro-economic environment, coupled with devaluations of certain local currencies in Latin America versus the U.S. dollar, the effects of Argentine and Venezuelan translations of local
currencies into U.S. dollar and high interest rates in those countries, could cause an experience declining year-to-year net revenues, particularly as measured in U.S. dollars. 
Gross profit margins  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our business has generated sustained high gross profit margins over time, as defined by total net revenues minus total cost of net revenues, as a percentage of net revenues. Historically, gains in gross
profit margins have been mainly attributable to increased economies of scale in customer service, Internet Service Provider (ISP) connectivity and site operations and improved economic terms obtained from payment processors. 
Our gross profit margins were 73.7% for 2012, 75.9% for 2011 and 78.5% for 2010. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, fluctuations in gross profit
margins primarily resulted from the higher penetration of our payment solution into our marketplace, which implies a higher cost of net revenue. In the future, gross profit margins could decline if the cost of net revenues as a percentage of net
revenues increases as the penetration of our payment solution grows faster than our marketplace, or if we cannot sustain the economies of scale that we have achieved.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Improving operating income margins  We have generated and expect to
continue generating economies of scale in operating expenses. For the past three years, our operating income margins, defined as our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues has decreased from 34.4% for 2010 to 33.4% for 2011, and
increased again to 34.7% for 2012, mostly as a result of the impact of economies of scale. We anticipate, however, that as we continue to invest in product development, sales and marketing and human resources in order to promote our services and
capture the long-term business opportunity offered by the Internet in Latin America, it is increasingly difficult to sustain growth in operating income margins, and at some point in the future we could experience decreasing operating income margins.
 Growth in net income  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have generated growth in our net income as a consequence of the above mentioned trends. In 2010 our net income was $56.0 million. For 2011, our net income grew 37.1% to $76.8 million. For
2012, our net income grew 32.0% to $101.3 million. However, as mentioned above, if any of these trends were to revert, our net income growth could be materially adversely affected, or could even become negative on a year-to-year basis.

The 25.0% growth in net revenues from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2012 derived mainly from
a 18.3% increase in the gross merchandise volume (GMV) transacted through our platform from 2011 to 2012. This GMV growth resulted from a 27.6% increase in items sold between those years. Non-marketplace revenues from financing and
off-platform payments grew 37.0% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, mainly as a consequence of a 36.2% increase in the total payments volume (TPV) paid using MercadoPago. Finally, classified
and ad sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 grew 37.5% as compared to the same period of 2011.

 Measured in local currencies, net revenues grew 38.9% in the year ended December 31,
2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The local currency revenue growth was calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2011 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2012, so as to calculate what our
financial results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next.  The following table
summarizes the changes in net revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:

Percentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table. 
The increase in cost of net revenues was primarily attributable to a $13.2 million increase in collection fees. The increase in
collection fees, which occurred primarily in Brazil and Argentina but also in all other countries where MercadoPago operates, was a result of the higher penetration of MercadoPago, which has a higher collection fee cost, into our marketplace. For
the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 31.3% and 27.2%, respectively, of our total GMV (excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft and real estate) was completed through MercadoPago. In addition, during the year ended December 31,
2012 as compared to the same period in the prior year, expenditures related to our in-house customer support operations increased by $4.9 million, primarily driven by increases in compensation costs, recruitment, investments to improve our
customer service and initiatives to combat fraud, illegal items and fee evasion and also driven by the customer support center opened in Aguada Park, Uruguay during 2012. Moreover, sales taxes on our net revenues increased by $1.1 million, or
5.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period of 2011 as a consequence of an increase in our net revenues. Finally, our hosting expenses increased $1.8 million year-over-year, mainly as a consequence of higher volumes
of traffic.  The cost of net revenues margin increased 220 basis points, from 24.1% in 2011 to 26.3% in 2012, primarily as a
result of the higher penetration of our Payment solution into our marketplace.  Product and technology development

The growth in product and technology development expenses in 2012 as compared to the same periods in 2011 was primarily attributable to
an increase of $3.1 million, or a 29.3% increase, in compensation costs. These additional compensation expenses were primarily related to the addition of engineers and, to a lesser extent, to increases in salaries, as we continue to invest in
top quality talent to develop enhancements and new features across our platforms. We believe product development is one of our key competitive advantages and intend to continue to invest in adding engineers to meet the increasingly sophisticated
product expectations of our customer base.  Product and technology development expenses also grew in 2012 as a consequence of
an increase in other expenses of $1.1 million as compared to 2011, related to the use of cloud computing (AWS), Information technology consulting fees, real-time monitoring of our applications and the use of content distribution network (CDN)
which is a system of computers containing copies of data placed at various nodes of a network and, an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to product and technology development of $1.1 million, or 21.9%, compared to 2011.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the increase of $7.0 million year-over-year, in sales and marketing expenses was primarily
driven by: i) an increase of $8.1 million in total chargebacks expenses mainly attributable to our Brazilian operation, partially offset by a $1.7 million recovery of MercadoPago disabled accounts which had been disable for more than three years as
of December 31, 2012; ii) an increase of $3.7 million in salaries driven by higher salaries to retain talent; iii) an increase of $0.2 million in trust and safety expenses due to the increased use of our buyer protection program developed to
compensate buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods. These increases were partially offset by i) a decrease in Bad debt charge of $1.2 million year-over-year; and ii) a decrease in off-line
marketing expenses of $1.3 million in 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  General and administrative

$0.5 million in depreciation and amortization. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in office expenses, mainly related to the moves from our main locations to new offices during
2011.  Other income, net

income related to higher interest income earned on our investments driven by a greater volume of investments in all locations; b) a $2.5 million decrease in financial expenses; and c) a $2.3 million decrease in foreign currency gains
mainly attributable to: a) an increase in receivables denominated in U.S. dollars in Argentina with a devaluation year-over-year of approximately 14%; b) an increase in liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars in Brazil with a devaluation
year-over-year of approximately 9%, partially offset by an increase in receivables and in cash held denominated in U.S. dollars; and c) a decrease in long-term investments denominated in U.S. dollars in Mexico where the Mexican Pesos appreciated
against the U.S. dollar year-over-year by approximately 7%.

The $7.2 million increase in our income and asset tax expense from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the same period in 2012 was
primarily a result of increases in income tax charges in most of our segments, driven by higher taxable income year over year. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our income and asset tax expense margin was slightly lower as compared to the
same period in the previous year, mainly as a consequence of an increase in the taxable income in Argentina as compared to our other locations. Our effective tax rate in Argentina is lower than other locations as a consequence of the prevailing tax
holiday. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we reversed $2.0 million of tax valuation allowance related to a Brazilian subsidiary acquired in 2001. The reversal of the tax valuation allowance was derived from our tax planning
strategies implemented during the year 2011 and were designed to more efficiently use our accumulated tax loss carryforward credits from acquired companies. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the previous year, our
income and asset tax expense margin was positively impacted by a decrease in non-deductible expenses mainly in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our blended tax rate is defined as income and asset tax expense as a percentage of income before income and asset tax. Our effective income tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes (net of
charges related to dividend distribution from foreign subsidiaries which are offset with domestic foreign tax credits) as a percentage of pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate excludes the effects of the deferred income tax, and the assets
and complementary income tax.  The following table summarizes the changes in our blended and effective tax rate for the years

 Our blended tax rate decreased from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended
December 31, 2012, mainly because: a) in 2012 our Argentine taxable income has a higher share of the consolidated taxable income when compared to the same period in 2011, which results in a lower consolidated tax rate as a consequence that
Argentina has a lower tax rate (as we are beneficiary of a software development law) as compared to other locations; b) in 2011 we recorded certain Brazilian non-deductible losses related to voided and/or overdrawn checks processed by a MercadoPago
payments processor as described in our Sales and Marketing discussion and during 2012, we recovered partially such losses, as non-taxable income; and c) we recorded a decrease in non-deductible expenses, mainly in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela,
year-over-year.  Our effective tax rate increased from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the same period in 2012 mainly
due to the use of the remaining tax loss carryforwars in 2011 relating to our Brazilian business reorganization generated as part of our tax planning strategy.  <FONT

 The Companys Argentine subsidiary is a beneficiary of a software development law
providing it with relief of 60% of total income tax determined in each year. Mainly for that reason, our Argentine operations effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are currently lower than the local
statutory rate of 35%. If we had not been granted this Argentine tax relief, our Argentine effective income tax rate would have been higher but, in that case, we would have pursued an alternative tax planning strategy. In addition, the Argentine
government issued a new software development law which still awaits a final regulatory decree. If our Argentine subsidiary qualifies under the new software development law, it is possible that the current Argentine income tax relief we benefit from
could be reduced slightly. However, under the new law, it is also possible that the tax relief would be extended for an additional five years, while also providing us with certain other fiscal benefits. 
The decrease in our Argentine operations effective income tax rate year over year is mainly related to changes in temporary tax
differences, including the relief in the income tax expense derived from the application of the software development law.  The
increase in our Brazilian effective income tax rate, year-over-year, due mainly to the business reorganization generated in 2011, as part of our tax planning strategy, which permitted us to use the remaining tax loss carryforwards in that country
and also as a consequence of changes in temporary tax differences. Our effective tax rate is slightly higher than the 34% statutory tax rate.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For the year ended December 31, 2012, our Mexican effective income tax rate approximates the local statutory rate of 30%. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our Mexican effective income tax
rate was lower than the local statutory rate mainly as a consequence of temporary and permanent tax differences.  For the
years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, our Venezuelan effective income tax rates were higher than the local statutory rate of 34% mainly due to (i) losses related to temporary differences generated by the re-measurement of our
foreign-currency position computed for tax purposes that cannot be considered for U.S. GAAP purposes (our Venezuelan subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to a highly inflationary environment) and (ii) certain non-deductible
expenses that are, mainly related to local inflation adjustment computed for tax purposes but not considered for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, and (iii) temporary differences. 
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates
lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, especially in the case of Argentina, where we have significant operations with a low effective tax rate as a consequence of the previously discussed tax relief. A future change in the mix of pre-tax income
from these various tax jurisdictions would impact the Companys periodic effective tax rate.  We do not expect to have a
significant impact in the domestic effective income tax rate related to dividend distributions from foreign subsidiaries since our strategy is to reinvest our cash surplus in our international operations, and to distribute dividends when they can be
offset with available tax credits.  Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010

The 37.9% growth in net revenues from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 resulted principally
from a 41.5% increase in the gross merchandise volume (GMV) transacted through our platform from 2010 to 2011. This GMV growth resulted from a 34.6% increase in items sold between those years. The increase in GMV and items sold was
partially offset by a decrease in our take rate, which we define as net revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume, from 6.36% for the year ended December 31, 2010 to 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in
our take rate was primarily due to GMV growing faster than some of our revenue sources not tied to GMV, such as Classifieds and upfront fees. In addition, this GMV growth was positively impacted by U.S. dollars figures mainly due to the fact that
the parallel exchange rate used by our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of 2010 was 6.28 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar as compared to 5.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar for 2011. See Critical accounting policies and estimates

 Measured in local currencies, net revenues grew 34.7% in the year ended December 31,
2011, compared to the same period in 2010. The local currency revenue growth was calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2010 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2011, so as to calculate what our
financial results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next.  The following table

The increase in cost of net revenues was primarily attributable to an $11.2 million increase in collection fees. The increase in
collection fees, which occurred primarily in Brazil and Argentina, was a result of the higher penetration of MercadoPago, which has a higher collection fee cost, into our marketplace. For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, 27.2% and
20.9%, respectively, of our total GMV (excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft and real estate) was completed through MercadoPago. In addition, sales taxes on our net revenues increased by $6.3 million, or 42.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2011, compared to the same period of 2010 as a consequence of an increase in our net revenues. Moreover, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year, expenditures related to our
in-house customer support operations increased by $5.4 million, which increase was primarily driven by increases in compensation costs, recruitment, investments in improved service and initiatives to combat fraud, illegal items and fee evasion.
Finally, for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the previous year, bank transfer fees related to MercadoPago, mainly in Brazil, increased by $0.9 million. 
The cost of net revenues margin increased 262 basis points, from 21.5% in 2010 to 24.1% in 2011, primarily as a result of the higher
penetration of our MercadoPago into our marketplace.  Product and technology development

The growth in product and technology development expenses in 2011 as compared to the same periods in 2010 was primarily attributable to
an increase of $2.7 million or a 33.7% increase in compensation costs. These additional compensation expenses were primarily related to the addition of engineers and, to a lesser extent, to increases in salaries, as we continue to invest in top
quality talent to develop enhancements and new features across our platforms. We believe product development is one of our key competitive advantages and intend to continue to invest in adding engineers to meet the increasingly sophisticated product
expectations of our customer base.  Product and technology development expenses also grew in 2011 as a consequence of an
increase in maintenance expenses of $1.9 million compared to 2010, related to the use of cloud computing (AWS), information technology consulting fees, real-time monitoring of our applications and the use of content distribution network (CDN)
which is a system of computers containing copies of data placed at various nodes of a network and, an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to product and technology development of $1.7 million, or 50.7% compared to 2010.
In addition, there was an increase of $1.1 million, compared to the same period in 2010, in other product and development expenses.

The increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily attributable to a
$8.8 million or 296.3% increase in other marketing expenses related to MercadoPago chargebacks mainly in Brazil and due to a one-time negative impact related to certain voided or overdrawn checks that were processed by one of MercadoPagos
payments processors in Brazil, which resulted in a loss of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2011. Sales and marketing expenses also grew as a consequence of $4.1 million increase in bad debt charges. In addition, sales and marketing
expenses grew in 2011, due to a $1.7 million or 18.9% increase in compensation costs driven by higher salaries to retain talent, and a $1.5 million increase in trust and safety expenses due to the increased use of our buyer protection
program developed to compensate buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods. Finally, our business off-line expenses increased $0.2 million year over year. 
The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 was partially offset by a $0.5 million
decrease in on line expenses as a consequence of decreases in our affiliate program expenses. Online advertising, including our affiliate program and portal deals expenses, represented 5.8% of our net revenues in the year ended December 31,
2011, down from 8.2% for the same period in 2010.  General and administrative

resulting from our determination to pre-sell installment-related financing receivables, which we commenced in the third quarter of 2010; (b) a $5.0 million increase in interest income and other financial charges related to higher interest
income earned on our investments driven by a greater volume of investments and higher interest rates, particularly in Brazil; and (c) a $2.4 million increase in foreign currency gains attributable to the impact of the local currency
appreciation on the cash balances held by our Brazilian and Mexican subsidiaries in U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the same period of 2010.

The $15.8 million increase in our income and asset tax expense from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the same period in 2011 was
primarily a result of increases in income tax charges in all our segments, driven by higher taxable income year over year. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our income and asset tax expense margin is higher as compared to the same period in
the previous year, because in the year ended December 31, 2010 we recognized an income tax gain of $4.6 million due to a reversal of tax valuation allowance related to our Brazilian subsidiaries while during the year ended
December 31, 2011,we reversed $2.0 million related to a Brazilian subsidiary acquired in 2001. The reversal of the tax valuation allowance was derived from our tax planning strategies implemented during the year which were designed to more
efficiently use our accumulated tax loss carryforward credits from acquired companies. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the previous year, our income and asset tax expense margin was negatively impacted by
increases in income tax charge in Brazil as a consequence of permanent tax differences period over period.  The following

 The Companys Argentine subsidiary is a beneficiary of a software development law granting it a
relief of 60% of total income tax determined in each year. Mainly for that reason, our Argentine operations effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are currently lower than the local statutory rate of 35%.
If we had not been granted the Argentine tax holiday, our Argentine effective income tax rate would have been higher but, in that case, we would have pursued an alternative tax planning strategy. 
The decrease in our Argentine operations effective income tax rate year over year was mainly related to variations in temporary tax
differences.  For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our Brazilian effective income tax rate are lower than the
local statutory rate of 34% mainly because of the business reorganization generated as part of our tax planning strategy, which permitted us to use tax loss carryforwards in that country. 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, our Mexican effective income tax rate is lower than the local statutory rate of 30% mainly
because of variations in permanent tax differences. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Mexican effective income tax rate is higher than the local statutory rate mainly as a consequence of temporary and permanent tax differences.
 For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our Venezuelan effective income tax rates are higher than the local
statutory rate mainly due to losses related to temporary differences generated by the re-measurement of our foreign-currency position computed for tax purposes that cannot be considered for U.S. GAAP purposes (our Venezuelan subsidiaries functional
currency is the U.S. dollar due to a highly inflationary environment).  Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of
significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, especially in the case of Argentina, where we have significant operations with a low effective tax as a consequence of an
Argentine tax holiday. A future change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions would impact the Companys periodic effective tax rate.  <FONT

operations and financial condition  Our total net assets balances as of December 31, 2012 have increased as compared
to December 31, 2011 as a result of our net income increase in 2012 of $24.5 million and other movements affecting equity. 
Assets and liabilities balances relating to operations have in general changed accordingly and as a result of the increase in operations

 Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and
difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce and emerging markets like Latin America. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must, among other things, maintain and increase the
number of our confirmed registered users, items listed on our service and completed transactions, maintain and enhance our brand, implement and execute our business and marketing strategy successfully, continue to develop and upgrade our technology
and information-processing systems, continue to enhance the MercadoLibre and MercadoPago services to meet the needs of a changing market, provide superior customer service, respond to competitive developments, and attract, integrate, retain and
motivate qualified personnel. Accordingly, we intend to invest heavily in marketing and promotion, site development, technology and operating infrastructure development and personnel. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in
accomplishing all of these goals, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Although we have experienced significant revenue growth and significant growth in the number of our confirmed registered users and items listed by our users in recent periods, such growth rates are not
sustainable and will decrease in the future. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should
not be relied upon as indications of future performance.  Our operating results have varied on an annual basis during our
short operating history and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. The following list includes factors that may affect our operating results: 
 


 

 
 continued growth of online commerce and Internet usage in Latin America; 
 


 

 
 our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies; 
 


 

 
 governmental regulation in the countries where we operate, including exchange controls; 
 


 

 
 litigation, legal liability and intellectual property rights enforcement; 
 


 

 
 system interruptions or failures;   


 

 
 our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
 


 

 
 the announcement or introduction of new sites, services and products by us or our competitors, and price competition; 
 


 

 
 reliance on third-party service providers;   


 

 
 increasing consumer confidence in and acceptance of the Internet and other online services for commerce and, in particular, the trading of products
such as those listed on our web site;   


 

 
 security breaches and consumer confidence in the security of transactions over the Internet; 
 


 

 
 consumer trends and popularity of certain categories of items; 
 


 

 
 our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase revenues; 
 


 

 
 seasonal fluctuations; and   


 

 
 political, social and economic conditions in Latin America, particularly those in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, including foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and exchange currency restrictions.  Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors for a
discussion of material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.  Liquidity and capital resources 
Our main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund our MercadoPago financing operation in Brazil. We also require
cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure, software applications and office space and to fund the payment of cash dividends on shares of our common stock. 
Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders during our first two
years of operations, from funds raised during our initial public offering, and from cash generated from our operations. We have funded MercadoPago by discounting credit card receivables, with loans backed with credit card receivables and through
cash advances derived from our business.

 At December 31, 2012, our principal source of liquidity was $195.2 million of cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $86.0 million of long-term investments provided by cash generated from operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and funds receivable from and payable to
MercadoPago users.  In the event we change the way we manage our business, the working capital needs could be funded, as we
did in the past, through a combination of the sale of credit card coupons to financial institutions, loans backed by credit card receivables and cash advances from our business.

payable to customers, a $7.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $3.9 million decrease in credit card receivables.

 The $21.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year
ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was mainly attributable to a $20.8 million increase in net income. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a $2.3 million increase in changes in
accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities related to our Brazilian and Argentine operations, a $7.8 million increase in non-cash charges primarily attributable to deferred tax assets related to the reversal of our Brazilian tax
valuation allowance (See Income and Asset tax for more detail) and depreciation and amortization.  These increases
in cash provided by operations were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in other assets in the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the same period of 2010, a $2.2 million increase in changes in account receivables in the year ended
December 31, 2011 versus the same period of 2010 and a $4.8 million decrease in working capital related to our payments solution, derived mostly from higher increases of credit card receivables than our funds payable to customers due to a
higher amount of transactions in 2011.  Net cash used in investing activities

For the year ended December 31, 2011, our primary use of cash was to fund the $10.6 million of cash dividends paid in 2011 while
during 2010 our primary use of cash for financing activities was a reduction in short term debt in connection with our repayment of $3.0 million of notes outstanding which were issued in connection with the DeRemate acquisition. 
In the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future, we may fund them with available cash, third party debt
financing, or by raising equity capital, as market conditions allow.  Debt 
As of December 31, 2012, the Company recorded $4.8 million of dividends payable to its stockholders. In addition, as of
December 31, 2012, our outstanding debt of $0.1 million is related to Argentine car lease contracts. As of December 31, 2011, the Company recorded $3.5 million of dividends payable to its stockholders. In addition, as of
December 31, 2011, our outstanding debt of $0.4 million is related to Argentine car lease contracts. See Contractual obligations below for more information.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Cash Dividends  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, our
Board of Directors declared cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $14.1 million or $0.32 per share.  On October 30,
2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $4.8 million cash dividend on our outstanding shares of common stock (or $0.109 per share). The dividend was paid on January 15, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the
close of business on December 31, 2012. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the Company approved cash dividends for a total amount of $19.2 million or $0.436 per share. 
On February, 22 2013, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $6.3 million on our outstanding shares of common stock
(or $0.143 per share). The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2013.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, any future determination as to the declaration of dividends on our common stock will be made at the
discretion of our board of directors.  Capital expenditures  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our capital expenditures decreased $6.2 million, to $18.5 million in 2012 as compared to $24.7 million in 2011, mainly due to the acquisition, during 2011, of a new office property located in
Caracas, Venezuela for approximately $6.6 million and to the acquisition for approximately $5.5 million for the 60% of Autoplaza acquisition, as described above in the sections Liquidity and Capital resources and Net cash used
in investing activities and due to higher information technology investments made during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company increased the level of investment on hardware and software licenses necessary to improve and update the
technology of our platform, cost of computer software developed internally and office equipment for new office space in Uruguay. We anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures related to information technology in the future as we strive
to maintain our position in the Latin American e-commerce market.  Acceptance of an offer to purchase  software
development company  On February 13, 2013, a Companys subsidiary received an offer to acquire 100% of the
outstanding shares of a software development company located in the province of Cordoba, Argentina. The purchase price for the acquisition of this software development company is approximately $3.3 million (based on the exchange rate in effect as of
December 31, 2012). The offer permits the Companys subsidiary to terminate the acquisition, provided the Companys subsidiary pays to the sellers a termination fee of approximately $0.3 million (based on the exchange rate in effect
as of December 31, 2012). The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the execution of certain transaction documents. The transaction is expected to close on April 1, 2013. At the date of
issuance of this annual report, the offer has been accepted.

In February 2010, our Argentine subsidiary signed a Company car lease contract to buy 12 cars for certain employees of the Company. The remaining lease contract
amounts to $84,570 and matures in July 2013. In addition, during September 2011, our Argentine subsidiary signed another car lease contract to buy 8 cars for certain employees of the Company. The remaining lease contract amounts to $59,493 and
matures in September 2014. Finally, In January 2012 our Colombian subsidiary signed a car lease contract to acquire a car. The remaining lease contract amount to $23,391 and matures in January 2015.

Includes leases of office space. 
We have leases for office space in certain countries in which we operate and leases for Company cars in Argentina. Purchase obligation
amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (technological equipment and software licenses) and other goods and services that were entered into in the ordinary course of business. We have developed estimates to
project payment obligations based upon historical trends, when available, and our anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements, actual payments could differ
significantly from these estimates.   


ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations. These market risks arise mainly from the possibility that changes in interest rates and the US dollar exchange rate with local
currencies, particularly the Brazilian Reals due to Brazils share of our revenues, may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Foreign Currencies Risk  At December 31, 2012, we hold cash and
cash equivalents in local currencies in our subsidiaries, and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations. Our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in local currency. As a result, our
subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency, except for our Venezuelan subsidiaries which functional currency is the US dollar due to a highly inflationary accounting. At December 31, 2012, the total cash and cash
equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled $82.9 million, short-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled $87.4 million, and accounts receivable and funds receivable from customers in foreign currencies totaled
$55.3 million. To manage exchange rate risk, our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into dollar-denominated accounts in the U.S. At December 31, 2012, our
dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $24.9 million and our dollar-denominated long-term investments totaled $85.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we obtained foreign currency
gains in the amount of $11,597 as the cash and investment balances of the subsidiaries held in US dollars appreciated in local current terms. (See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Results of operations for the Year ended December 31, 2012, compared to year ended December 31, 2011  Other income (expenses) for more detail).

Table of Contents

 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have transitioned our Venezuelan operations to highly
inflationary status as of January 1, 2010 and have been using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for these operations since then. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, translation adjustments for prior periods were not removed from equity and
the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets at December 31, 2010 become the accounting basis for those assets. Monetary assets and liabilities in Bolivares Fuertes were re-measured to the U.S. dollar at the closing parallel
exchange rate and the results of the operations in Bolivares Fuertes were re-measured to the U.S. dollar at the average monthly parallel exchange rate.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During 2010 and previous years we were able to obtain U.S. dollars using alternative mechanisms other than the CADIVI. These dollars, obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by CADIVI, and
held in balance at U.S. bank accounts of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, were used for dividend distributions from our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, during 2010, lack of CADIVI approval did not restrict our ability to distribute the full amount
of our retained earnings as dividends related to fiscal years 2008 ($0.8 million), and 2009 ($1.8 million). In addition, during 2011, our Venezuelan subsidiary distributed $4.2 million of dividends related to earnings for fiscal year 2010,
using existing cash balances held in the U.S. bank accounts. No dividends were declared during 2012. For further information relating to recent devaluation in Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risk related to doing business in Latin
AmericaPolitical and economic conditions in Venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations. and Item 7  Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  Critical
accounting policies  Foreign currency translation.  As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net assets of our
Venezuelan subsidiaries (before intercompany eliminations) amounted to approximately 13.9% and 9.3%, respectively, of our consolidated net assets. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash and investments of our Venezuelan subsidiaries held in
local currency in Venezuela amounted to approximately 15.5% and 7.6%, respectively, of our consolidated cash and investments. We do not expect that the current restrictions on our ability to purchase U.S. dollars will have a significant adverse
effect on our business plans with regard to the investment in Venezuela; however we can provide no assurance that the restrictions or conditions in Venezuela will not change and such change could have a material adverse effect on us. 
If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in
increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income while the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars will have a negative impact in our Statement of Income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses and net income will
decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, while the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars will have a positive impact in our Statement of Income.

Depreciation of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The table above may not total due to rounding  The table above shows an increase
in our net income when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies because the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars has a lesser impact than the increase in net revenues, operating expenses, and other income
(expenses) and income tax lines related to the translation effect. Similarly, the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because the re-measurement of our net asset position in
U.S. dollars has a lesser impact than the decrease in net revenues, operating expenses, and other income (expenses) and income tax lines related to the translation effect. 
In the past we have entered into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure but during 2012, 2011 and
2010 we did not enter into any such agreement.  Interest Rate Risk 
Our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates. These changes can have an impact on our interest expenses
derived from selling our MercadoPago receivables. At December 31, 2012, MercadoPagos funds receivable from customers totaled approximately $35.8 million. Interest fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate
and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits, money market funds, investment grade corporate debt securities, and sovereign debt securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a
degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. 
Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. As of
December 31, 2012, the average duration of our available for sale securities, defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100-basis-point change in yield, is 3.4%. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase
(decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of our available for sale securities as of December 31, 2012 could decrease (increase) by approximately $3.2 million. 
Our short-term and long-term investments, which are classified on our balance sheet as current assets in the amount of $93.7 million
and as non-current assets in the amount of $86.0 million, respectively, can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments
at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date.  Equity Price Risk
 Our board of directors adopted the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP payable as follows: 
 


 

 
 eligible employees will receive a fixed cash payment equal to 6.25% of his or her 2009 and/or 2010 and/or 2011 and/or 2012 LTRP bonus once a year for a
period of eight years starting in 2010 and/or 2011 and/or 2012 and/or 2013 (the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Annual Fixed Payment); and 
   78 





Table of Contents




 

 
 on each date we pay the Annual Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a cash payment (the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012
Variable Payment) equal to the product of (i) 6.25% of the applicable 2009 and/or 2010 and/or 2011 and/or 2012 LTRP bonus and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock
Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Stock Price, defined as $13.81, $45.75, $65.41 and $77.77 for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP, respectively, which was the average closing price of the
Companys common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60 trading days of 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Applicable Year Stock Price shall equal the average closing price of the Companys common stock on
the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60 trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date. 
The 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Variable Payment LTRP liability subjects us to equity price risk. At December 31, 2012, the total
contractual obligation fair value of our 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Variable Payment LTRP liability amounts to $14.2 million. As of December 31, 2012, the accrued liability related to the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Variable Payment portion
of the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP included in social security payable in our consolidated balance sheet amounts to $5.5 million. The following table shows a sensitivity analysis of the risk associated with our total contractual obligation
related to the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Variable Payment if our stock price were to increases or decreases by up to 40%.

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  <FONT

 Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on its evaluation
under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our
Board of Directors.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been
audited by Deloitte & Co. S.A., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Our Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan was entered into prior to our IPO. 
Description of Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan 
Our 1999 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on November 3, 1999. The 1999 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code), to our employees, and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock to our employees, directors, agents,
advisors, independent consultants and contractors. Incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are referred to as stock options, and together with restricted stock are referred to as awards. The 1999 Plan expired
on November 3, 2009 and as a result, no new awards may be made under the 1999 Plan. However, any outstanding awards at the expiration shall remain in effect until the earlier of the exercise, termination or expiration of such outstanding
awards. At December 31, 2012, options to purchase a total of 2,013 shares of common stock were outstanding under the 1999 Plan at a weighted average price of $1.50 per share. 
Number of shares of common stock available under the stock option plan. A total of 4,732,400 shares of common stock were reserved
for issuance pursuant to the 1999 Plan. Shares covered by awards that are forfeited or terminated without exercise will be available for future awards. The shares of common stock issuable under the 1999 Plan shall be (1) authorized but unissued
shares, (2) shares of common stock held in our treasury, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). 
Administration of the stock option plan. The 1999 Plan is administered by our Board or a committee appointed by the Board of
Directors (the body in charge of administering the 1999 Plan is referred to as the administrator). If the common stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Board of Directors shall consider in
selecting the administrator and the membership of any committee acting as administrator the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code regarding outside directors and the provisions of Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act regarding non-employee directors. The administrator determines the recipients of awards, times at which awards are granted, number of shares subject to each type of award, the time for vesting of each award and the duration
of the exercise period for options.  Price, exercise and termination of awards. The exercise price for each share of common stock
subject to an option is determined by the administrator, and in the case of an incentive stock option the exercise price cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of the grant (or 110% in the case of
employees who directly or indirectly own more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock). 
Options are exercisable on their vesting date, which is determined by the administrator and set forth in the award agreement governing
any particular option. Vesting dates can be accelerated on the occurrence of a specified event, as provided in an award agreement, or can be accelerated at the discretion of the administrator. 
   81 





Table of Contents

 If a participant in the Stock Option Plan ceases to be employed or perform services for us,
we have the right to repurchase any unvested shares at the exercise price paid per share. The terms and procedures of a repurchase are to be set forth in the Award Agreement that governs the relevant unvested shares. 
If an option expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised it shall become null and void and of no further force and
effect. The term of an option may not exceed beyond the tenth anniversary on which the option is granted (or the fifth anniversary in the case of incentive stock options granted to employees who directly or indirectly own 10% of the total combined
voting power of all classes of our stock.) An option terminates 30 days after a participant ceases to be an employee or director as a result of a termination without cause, and after 10 days of termination in the case of a termination for
cause. Cause includes the conviction of a crime involving fraud, theft, dishonesty or moral turpitude, the participants continuous disregard of or willful misconduct in carrying lawful instructions of superiors, continued use of alcohol or
drugs that interfered with the performance of the participants duties, the conviction of participant for committing a felony or similar foreign crime, and any other cause for termination set forth in a participants employment agreement.
An option terminates 10 days after a participant ceases to be an independent consultant, contractor or advisor to us or agent of ours for any reason. It also terminates three months after the death or permanent disability of a participant, or, if
the participant is a party to an employment agreement, the disability of such participant as defined in the employment agreement. Other reasons for termination may be set out in the Award Agreement. 
An option will not be considered an incentive stock option to the extent that the aggregate fair market value (on the date of the grant
of the incentive stock option) of all stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year is greater than $100,000. No option shall be affected by a change of duties or
position of a participant (including transfer to our subsidiaries) as long as the participant continues to be our employee or an employee of our subsidiaries.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Adjustments upon the occurrence of material transactions. In the event we undergo dissolution or liquidation, a reorganization, merger or consolidation in which we are not the surviving entity, or
a sale of all or substantially all of our assets (each, a Material Transaction) holders of options will be given 10-day prior written notice and will decide within those 10 days whether to exercise their respective options. Any
option that is not so exercised will terminate. However, such notice and exercise mechanism would not apply if provision is made in connection with a Material Transaction for assumption of outstanding options, or substitution of options for new
options or equity securities, with any appropriate adjustments as to the number, kind and prices of shares subject to options. 
Transferability. Unless the prior written consent of the administrator is obtained, no option can be assigned or otherwise
transferred by any participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except in the case of an approved transfer, an option may be exercised during the lifetime of a participant only by the participant or his/her legal
representative if the participant is legally disabled.  Restricted stock. Restricted stock awards are awards of shares
of common stock that vest according to the terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator may impose whatever restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture and other restrictions as it determines. A holder of
restricted stock has the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote the restricted stock. During the restricted period applicable to the restricted stock, it may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, margined or otherwise
encumbered. Except as otherwise determined by the administrator, restricted stock that is subject to restrictions is subject to forfeiture upon termination of a participants employment. 
Amendment. The Board may modify the 1999 Plan at any time. The approval by a majority of our stockholders is necessary if required
by law or necessary to comply with any applicable laws and regulations. No amendment will affect the terms of any award granted prior to the effectiveness of such amendment, except with the consent of the holder of the award.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of MercadoLibre, Inc.  City of
Buenos Aires, Argentina  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MercadoLibre, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. We also have audited the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Companys Management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 



Table of Contents

 A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MercadoLibre, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012
and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  City of Buenos Aires, Argentina  <FONT

 Use of estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used
for, but not limited to accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts and chargeback provisions, depreciation, amortization, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, useful lives of long-lived assets,
impairment of short-term and long-term investments, compensation costs relating to the Companys long term retention plan, recognition of income taxes and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash and cash equivalents  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, consisting primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposit, to be cash
equivalents.  Investments  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Time deposits are valued at amortized cost plus accrued interest. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of the related tax provisions or benefits.  Investments
are classified as current or non-current depending on their maturity dates and when it is expected to be converted into cash. 
We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market
conditions. With respect to our debt securities, this assessment takes into account our intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and if
we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, a credit loss exists). We did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in 2012, 2011, or 2010.

 Fair value measurements 
Cash, money market funds, corporate and sovereign debt securities and asset backed securities are valued at fair value. Deposits in bank
accounts, accounts receivables, credit cards receivables, prepaid expenses, other assets, accounts payables, funds payable to customers, payroll and social security payables, taxes payables, loans and provisions and other liabilities, are valued at
cost which approximates their fair value because of its short-term maturity. See Note 8 Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities for further details.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Concentration of credit risk  Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
long-term investments, credit card receivables and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents and investments are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high
credit quality. Accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located internationally. Accounts receivable balances are settled through customer credit cards, debit cards, and MercadoPago accounts, with the majority of accounts
receivable collected upon processing of credit card transactions. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit cards receivables based upon its historical experience and current aging of customers. Historically, such charges
have been within management expectations. However, unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future statements of income or cash flows. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual accounts
receivable, the Company generally does not require collateral on these balances. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of net revenues. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, no single customer accounted for more
than 5% of accounts receivables.  Allowances for doubtful accounts 
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts, for managements estimate of probable losses that may result if customers do
not make the required payments. Allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, historical experience and the current aging of customers.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company charges-off receivables when the customer balance becomes 180 days past due.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Provision for chargebacks  The Company is exposed to losses due to credit
card fraud and other payment misuse. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience, as well as economic conditions.

 Credit cards receivables and funds payable to customers 
Credit cards receivables mainly relate to the Companys payments solution and arise due to the time taken to clear transactions
through external payment networks or during a short period of time until those credit cards receivables are sold to financial institutions.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Credit cards receivables are presented net of the related allowance for doubtful accounts.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there are no past due credit cards receivables.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Funds payable to customers relate also to the Companys payments solution and are originated by the amounts due to sellers held by the Company until the transaction is completed. Funds, net of any
amount due to the Company by the seller, are maintained in the sellers current account until collection is requested by the customer.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Transfer of financial assets  The Company may sell credit cards coupons to
financial institutions, included within Credit cards receivables. These transactions are accounted for as a true sale. Accounting guidance on transfer of financial assets establishes that the transferor has surrendered control over
transferred assets if and only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor, (2) each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received (3) the
transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. When all the conditions are met, the Company derecognizes the corresponding financial asset from its balance sheet. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there is no
continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. The aggregate amount of pre-tax gain recognized on sale of credit card coupons is $39,502,228, $32,566,802 and $19,195,987, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.  Property and equipment, net  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Property and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
 Costs related to the planning and post implementation phases of website development are recorded as an operating expense.
Direct costs incurred in the development phase of website are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company capitalized $3,970,717 and
$1,231,971, respectively.

 On February 14, 2011, the Companys Argentine subsidiary moved its
headquarters and Argentine operation offices to a new office building located in the City of Buenos Aires, with 5,340 square meters divided into 5 floors and 70 parking spaces. The building cost amounted to $8,854,879. On June 2, 2011,
MercadoLibre Venezuela S.A., a Companys wholly owned subsidiary. entered into an agreement with Inversiones 1182450, C.A. to acquire an office property of 992 square meters in the building Torre La Castellana, located in Avenida Eugenio
Mendoza, La Castellana, Municipality of Chacao, State of Miranda, Caracas, Venezuela for approximately $6.6 million.  Those
buildings, excluding lands, are depreciated from the date when they were ready to be used, using the straight-line depreciation method over a 50-year depreciable life.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Goodwill and intangible assets  Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is subject to an annual impairment test. The Company can choose to perform a qualitative assessment or to perform a
quantitative assessment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using the
income approach. In years 2012, 2011 and 2010 no goodwill impairment was recorded.  Intangible assets consist of customer
lists, trademarks, licenses and non-compete agreements acquired in business combinations and valued at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with definite useful life are amortized over the period of estimated benefit to be generated
by those assets and using the straight-line method; their estimated useful lives ranges from three to five years. Trademarks with indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subject to an annual impairment test, by comparing
their carrying amount with their corresponding fair value. For any given intangible asset with indefinite useful life, if its fair value exceeds its carrying amount no impairment loss shall be recognized. The Company can choose to perform a
qualitative assessment or to perform a quantitative assessment. In years 2012, 2011 and 2010, no intangible assets impairment was recorded.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Impairment of long-lived assets  The Company reviews long-lived assets for
impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted
future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired on this basis, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of
such asset.

 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life
 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life are reviewed at the end of the year for impairment or more
frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (considering each segment of the Company as a reporting unit) by comparing the
reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of such reporting unit. The Company adopted the new guidance to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life and, as a consequence, it may perform a
qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative assessment. If the Company performs the qualitative assessment and determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit
or the intangible asset with indefinite useful life is less than its carrying amount, the fair-value based on quantitative impairment test is applied. However, if the Company concludes, based on the qualitative assessment, that the fair value of
each of its reporting units or the intangible assets with indefinite useful life is greater than the respective carrying amounts, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December 31, 2012 the Company elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for both goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life. 
For the year ended December 31, 2012, the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the income approach. Cash flow
projections used were based on financial budgets approved by management. The growth rates applied do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the reporting unit operates. The Company uses discount rates to each
reporting unit in the range of 10% to 18%. The average discount rate used for 2012 was 11.4%. That rate reflected the Companys estimated weighted average cost of capital. Key drivers in the analysis include Confirmed Registered Users
(CRUs), Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) which represents a measure of the total U.S. dollar amount of all transactions completed through the MercadoLibre marketplace, excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate,
and services and take rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume. In addition, the analysis include a business to e-commerce rate, which represents growth of e-commerce as a percentage of GDP, internet
penetration rates as well as trends in the Companys market share.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. No impairment loss has been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and managements
assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful life
are considered impaired if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. No impairment loss has been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

 Revenue recognition 
The Company generates revenues from different services provided. When more than one service is included in one single arrangement with the
customer, the Company recognizes revenue according to multiple element arrangements accounting, distinguishing between each of the services provided and allocating revenues based on their respective selling prices. 
Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
 Revenues from services are separately recognized according to the following criteria described for each type of services:
 - Revenues from intermediation services derive from listing and final value fees paid by sellers. Listing fee revenues are
recognized ratably over the estimated period of the listing, while revenues related to final value fees are recognized at the time that the transaction is successfully concluded. An auction transaction is considered successfully concluded when at
least one buyer has bid above the sellers specified minimum price or reserve price, whichever is higher, at the end of the transaction term. Our payment services revenues are generated primarily from processing transactions for customers.
Revenues resulting from a payment processing transaction are recognized once the transaction is completed. The Company does not charge a separate fee for on-platform transactions. 
Listing and optional feature services, which fees relate to the right of a seller to have the item offered listed in a preferential way,
as well as classified advertising services, are recorded as revenue ratably during the listing period. Those fees are charged at the time the listing is uploaded onto the Companys platform and is not subject to successful sale of the items
listed.  - Revenues derived from the use of the Companys on-line payments solution, for transactions off-platform are
earned once the transaction is considered completed, when the payment is processed by the Company. We also earn revenues as a result of offering financing to our MercadoPago users, either directly or when the Company elects to sell the corresponding
financial assets to financial institutions.  - Advertising revenues such as the sale of banners are recognized on accrual
basis, and MercadoClics services or sponsorship of sites are recognized based on per-click (which are generated each time users on our websites click through our text-based advertisements to an advertisers designated website)
values and as the impressions (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our websites) are delivered.

 Share-based payments 
Shares granted under the 2008 long term retention plan (the 2008 LTRP) were accounted for at their grant date fair value.
 Fair value of stock options was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. This calculation is affected by the
Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. The use of a Black-Scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including
expected life, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. As a result, the future stock-based compensation expense may differ from historical amounts.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Fair value of restricted and additional shares and shares granted under the 2008 LTRP was calculated using the grant date price of the Companys shares. The 2008 LTRP has been fully settled during
the first quarter of 2012.  The liability related to the variable portion of 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 long term retention plan
is remeasured at fair value using the last 60 days average stock price at December 31, 2012 (See Note 16 Long Term Retention Plan for more details).  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that have a graded vesting schedule, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was in-substance multiple awards. 
Sales tax 
The Companys subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia are subject to certain sales taxes which are classified as
cost of net revenues and totaled $22,529,191, $21,387,561 and $15,049,821 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Advertising costs  We expense the costs of advertisements in the period
during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which is generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of
clicks delivered over the total number of contracted clicks, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising costs totaled $18,764,629, $19,914,755 and $20,173,078 for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 Comprehensive income 
Comprehensive income is comprised of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. This last component is defined as all
other changes in the equity of the Company that result from transactions other than with shareholders. Other comprehensive income includes the cumulative translation adjustment relating to the translation of the financial statements of the
Companys foreign subsidiaries (except Venezuela since January 1, 2010, see Foreign currency translation) and unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as available-for-sale. Total comprehensive income attributable
to MercadoLibre, Inc. shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $89,507,516, $62,135,746 and $57,391,398, respectively.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Redeemable noncontrolling interest  In September 2011, the Company acquired
the 60% of the shares of AP Clasificados S.R.L. de C.V. (AP Clasificados), and signed a call and a put option agreement to acquire the remaining 40% interest in AP Clasificados (See note 6 Business Combinations, Goodwill and
Intangible Assets for more detail). According to the signed agreement, the price for the remaining 40% interest call or put options will be determined by the greater of (i) $4,000,000 and (ii) the amount resulting from multiplying
(A) the percentage of the sellers interests as of the exercise date of the call/put option by (B) an amount equal to 3.5 times the amount of invoiced sales of such company for the twelve months period ending on the exercise date.
 The put option is to be exercised if any of the following events occurs: (i) the third anniversary of the acquisition
date, (ii) the termination of the employment of the main operating officer, and (iii) death or incapacitation of the main operating officer. The call option is to be exercised following the earlier to occur of (i) third anniversary of
the acquisition date and (ii) members holding a majority of the issued and outstanding interests determine that an additional capital contribution is required to capitalize AP Clasificados and the seller does not make such additional capital
contribution.  Redeemable noncontrolling interest is not considered to be a component of Equity and is reported in the
mezzanine section between total liabilities and equity in the consolidated balance sheet for a total amount of $4,000,000 at December 31, 2012. The noncontrolling interest was measured at its estimated redemption value according to the
abovementioned agreed conditions. Changes in the estimated redemption value as of the year-end were recorded in retained earnings.

 Foreign currency translation 
All of the Companys foreign operations have determined the local currency to be their functional currency, except for Venezuela
since January 1, 2010, as described below. Accordingly, these foreign subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars by using year-end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated
at the average rates in effect during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), included within the Statement of comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from transactions
denominated in non-functional currencies are recognized in earnings. Net foreign currency transaction losses are included in the consolidated statements of income under the caption Foreign currency gain (loss) and amounted to $11,597,
$2,353,005 and $(62,447) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Venezuelan currency
status  Until September 30, 2009, the Company translated its Venezuelan subsidiaries assets, liabilities, income and
expense accounts at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivares Fuertes per US dollar.  Starting in the fourth quarter of
2009, as a result of the changes in facts and circumstances that affected the Companys ability to convert currency for dividends remittances using the official exchange rate in Venezuela, the Venezuelan subsidiaries assets, liabilities, income
and expense accounts were translated using the parallel exchange rate resulting in the recognition in that quarter of a currency translation adjustment of $16,977,276 recorded in other comprehensive income. The average exchange rate used for
translating the fourth quarter results of 2009 was 5.67 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar and the year-end exchange rate used for translating assets and liabilities was 6.05 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar. 
According to U.S. GAAP, the Company transitioned its Venezuelan operations to highly inflationary status as of January 1, 2010
considering as if the U.S. dollar was the functional currency. See Highly inflationary status in Venezuela below. Therefore, no translation effect was accounted for in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2011 related to the Venezuelan operations.  Until May 13, 2010, the only way by which U.S. dollars could be
purchased outside the official currency market was using an indirect mechanism consisting in the purchase and sale of securities, including national public debt bonds (DPNs) denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and bonds issued by the government that
were denominated in U.S. dollars. This mechanism for transactions in certain securities created an indirect parallel foreign currency exchange market in Venezuela that enabled entities to obtain foreign currency through financial brokers
without going through Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange (CADIVI). Although the parallel exchange rate was higher, and accordingly less beneficial, than the official exchange rate, some entities used the
parallel market to exchange currency because of the delays of CADIVI in approving in a timely manner the exchange as requested by such entities. Until May 13, 2010, the Venezuelan subsidiaries used this mechanism to exchange
Bolivares Fuertes for U.S. dollars and accordingly the Company used the parallel average exchange rate to re-measure those foreign currency transactions.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Foreign currency translation (Continued)   
 However, on May 14, 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange
regulations and closed-down such parallel market by declaring that foreign-currency-denominated securities issued by Venezuelan entities were included in the definition of foreign currency, thus making the Banco Central of Venezuela (BCV
 the Venezuelan Central Bank) the only institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds, thereby excluding non-authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market. 
On June 9, 2010 the Venezuelan Government through its Central Bank implemented a regulated market for trading with foreign
currencies, being the BCV the only official institution through which foreign currency-denominated transactions could be brokered. Under that system, known as the Foreign Currency Securities Transactions System (SITME), entities domiciled in
Venezuela could then buy U.S. dollardenominated securities only through banks authorized by the BCV to import goods, services or capital inputs. Additionally, the SITME imposes volume restrictions on an entitys trading activity, limiting
such activity to a maximum equivalent of $50,000 per day, not to exceeding $350,000 in a calendar month. This limitation is non-cumulative, meaning that an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next. 
As a consequence of that system, commencing on June 9, 2010, the Company transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the SITME
rate and started re-measuring foreign currency transactions using the SITME rate published by BCV, which was 5.27 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar at that date.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For the period between May 14, 2010 and June 8, 2010 (during which there was no open foreign currency markets) the Company applied U.S. GAAP guidelines, which state that if exchangeability
between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date, the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could be made shall be used. Accordingly, the June 9, 2010 exchange rate published by the BCV was used to
re-measure transactions during the abovementioned period. As of December 31, 2012, the exchange rate used to re-measure transactions is 5.30 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar.

 Despite the increasing restrictions on the ability of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries to obtain U.S. dollars for
the purpose of distributing dividends to the Company or the other Companys subsidiaries, the Company does not expect that the current restrictions will have a material adverse effect on its business plans in Venezuela or on its overall
business, financial condition and results of operations.  See Note 21 Subsequent events for recent developments
relating to Venezuela exchange rate.  Argentine currency status 
The Argentine government has implemented certain measures that control and restrict the ability of companies and individuals to exchange
Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies. Those measures include, among other things, the requirement to obtain the prior approval from the Argentine Tax Authority of the foreign currency transaction (for example and without limitation, for the
payment of non-Argentine goods and services, payment of principal and interest on non-Argentine debt and also payment of dividends to parties outside of the country), which approval process could delay, and eventually restrict, the ability to
exchange Argentine pesos for other currencies, such as U.S. dollars. Those approvals are administered by the Argentine Central Bank through the Local Exchange Market (Mercado Unico Libre de Cambios or MULC), which is the only
market where exchange transactions may be lawfully made. Further, restrictions also currently apply to the acquisition of any foreign currency for holding as cash within Argentina. 
Although the controls and restrictions on the acquisition of foreign currencies in Argentina do place certain limitations on the current
ability of the Company to convert cash generated by its Argentine subsidiary to currencies different from the Argentine peso, based on the current state of Argentine currency rules and regulations, the Company does not expect that the current
controls and restrictions, will have a material adverse effect on its business plans in Argentina or on its overall business, financial condition and results of operations.

The cumulative three year inflation rate as of December 31, 2009 exceeded 100%. According to U.S. GAAP, calendar
year-end companies should apply highly inflationary accounting as from January 1st<FONT

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company is subject to U.S. and foreign income taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes following the liability method of accounting which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Companys deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The Companys income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any, plus the change during the period in the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
From fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2014, the Companys Argentine subsidiary is a beneficiary of a software development law.
Part of the benefits obtained from being a beneficiary of the aforementioned law is a relief of 60% of total income tax determined in each year, until fiscal year 2014. Aggregate tax relief totaled $9,204,773, $6,140,713 and $4,533,039 for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Aggregate per share effect of the Argentine tax holiday amounts to $0.21, $0.14 and $0.10 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If the Company had not been
granted the Argentine tax holiday, it would have pursued an alternative tax planning strategy and, therefore, the impact of not having this particular benefit would not necessarily be the abovementioned dollar and per share effect.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Income and asset taxes (Continued)   
 On August 17, 2011, the Argentine government issued a new software development Law
which is still pending for the regulatory decree. If the Argentine operation qualifies under the new software development law, the current income tax relief could slightly decrease but will extend the duration of tax holiday, which would otherwise
finish in 2014, for an additional five year period, to 2019 and would obtain some other fiscal benefits.  As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company has included under non-current deferred tax assets caption the foreign tax credits related to the dividend distributions received from its subsidiaries for a total amount of $2,414,440 and $2,965,668,
respectively. Those foreign tax credits will be used to offset the future domestic income tax payable.  Uncertainty in
income taxes  The Company recognizes, if any, uncertainty in income taxes by applying the accounting prescribed by U.S.
GAAP, for which a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be considered. It also
provides guidance on de-recognition, classification of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, accounting for interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and expanded income tax disclosures. The Company classifies interest and
penalties, if any, within income and asset taxes expense, in the statement of income.  The Company is subject to taxation in
the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions that are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2006 primarily include the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. 
Recently issued accounting pronouncements  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In February 2013 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the Accounting Standard Update No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. The amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts
reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that
are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. For public entities, the
amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this pronouncement as from fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013.

 Management estimates that the implementation of this new accounting guidance will not

Net income per share 
 Basic earnings per share for the Companys common stock is computed by dividing net income available to common
shareholders attributable to common stock for the year by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For the year ended December 31, 2010 the Companys restricted shares granted to its outside directors were participating securities. Accordingly, net income available to common stockholders for
the year ended December 31, 2010, was allocated between unvested restricted shares and common stock under the two class method for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. 
Diluted earnings per share for the Companys common stock assume the exercise of outstanding stock options, shares granted under 2008
Long Term Retention Plan (see Note 12), under the Companys stock based employee compensation plan, and the corresponding adjustment attributable to changes in redeemable non-controlling interest. 
The following table shows how net income is allocated using the two-class method for earnings per common share for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:

 On September 12, 2011 (the settlement date), part of the purchase price
amounting to $1,500,000, was placed into an escrow account, in order to cover unexpected liabilities and working capital. On September 12, 2012 the 50% of the escrow amount was released and the other 50% of the escrow amount less the amount of
all claims made by the Buyer, if any, will be released on September 12, 2013.  In addition, ETVE has the right and option
(but not the obligation) to purchase the remaining 40% of the membership interest of Autopark LLC following the earlier to occur of (i) third anniversary of the settlement date, or (ii) additional capital contribution be required to
capitalize Autopark LLC by their own members decision and Hasteny does not make such additional capital contribution within ten (10) days of such members consent. The total consideration to be paid shall be the greater of
(i) $4,000,000 and (ii) the amount resulting from multiplying (A) the percentage of the membership interest held by Hasteny as of the date of the Call Notice by (B) an amount equal to 3.5 times the amount of invoiced sales of the
Acquired Business for the twelve months period ending on the date of Call Notice.  On the other hand, Hasteny has the right and
option (but not the obligation) to sell and transfer, all of the Hasteny interest in Autopark LLC, to ETVE and ETVE has the obligation to buy following the earlier to occur (i) the third anniversary of the effective date, (ii) the
termination of the employment of the main operating officer of the acquired company, or (iii) death or incapacitation of the main operating officer of the acquired company. The total consideration to be paid by ETVE for the Hasteny Interests
shall be the same as described in the preceding paragraph.  The Seller and its affiliates have also agreed to enter into
certain non-compete agreements with the Company for 5 years since September 12, 2011.  The Companys statement of
income includes the results of operations of the Acquired Businesses as from September 15, 2011.  The following table
summarizes the allocation of the cash paid in the acquisition:

 Net assets acquired were valued at their respective fair values at the acquisition date according to U.S.
GAAP. The valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as non-controlling interest reflects managements estimates based on, among other factors, use of established valuation methods. The identifiable intangible assets consist
of trademarks and domains, customer lists and non-compete agreements. Management of the Company estimates that trademarks have an indefinite useful life, for that reason these intangible assets are not amortized but they are subject to an annual
impairment test. Intangible assets associated with customer list and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over a five year period.

(*)
The December 31, 2011 Asset Backed Securities (U.S. Agency Mortgage Backed Securities) balance was reclassified from the level 1 to the level 2 fair-value column,
since it derives from market observable inputs other than quoted prices as of that date. Agency MBS have high credit ratings and trade in a highly liquid market; ABS representing approximately 11.6 million of the December 2011 balance were
sold during 2012 for an aggregate amount of 12.0 million.  As of December 31, 2012, the Companys
financial assets valued at fair value consisted of assets valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (level 1) and other observable inputs (level 2). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from Observable inputs that reflect quoted
prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 instruments are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments (level 2). As of December 31, 2012, the Company did not have any assets without
observable market values that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (level 3).  The unrealized net
gains or loss on short term and long term investments are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company does not anticipate any significant realized losses associated with those investments in excess of the Companys
historical cost.  As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents
approximated their fair value which was held primarily in money market funds and bank deposits. In addition, the carrying value of accounts receivables, credit card receivables, other receivables, other assets, accounts payables, social security
payables, taxes payable, loans and provisions and other liabilities approximates their fair values because of its short term maturity.

Management incentive bonus plan 
 In September 2001, the Company implemented the 2001 Management Incentive Bonus Plan (the Incentive Plan) to
provide incentives to, and align the interests of, senior management with the Companys shareholders. As established in the Incentive Plan, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, with the consent of the board of directors, made the initial
determination as to the executives entitled to the benefits under the plan (the Participants) and the amounts of participation (the Participation Percentages). The board of directors administers the Incentive Plan.

Management incentive bonus plan (Continued)   
 Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, if the Company is sold, the Participants are entitled to
receive a sale bonus and a stay bonus as follows:   


 

 
 If the purchase price is equal or greater than $20,000,000, then Participants shall be entitled to receive i) a sale bonus equal to 5.5% of the
purchase price and ii) a stay bonus equal to 7.1% of the purchase price; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount paid or payable by the purchaser considered for the Incentive Plan calculation exceed $78,335,000. Each Participant shall
participate on these bonuses based on its Participation Percentage.   


 

 
 If the purchase price is less than $20,000,000, then Participants shall be entitled to receive a stay bonus equal to 7.1% of the purchase price. Each
Participant shall participate on this stay bonus based on its Participation Percentage.  As the
consummation of the sale is not considered probable, no provision has been recognized at December 31, 2012.

Income taxes (Continued)   
 During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has reversed
$1,955,723 and $4,648,574, respectively related to certain foreign and domestic valuation allowances based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. 
The Company has not considered $ 137.8 million of the non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of December 31,
2012. In determining the amount of non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings, the Company does not consider a portion of the non-U.S. subsidiaries earnings as of December 31, 2012 to be subject to. U.S. federal income tax purposes because such
earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations and potential acquisitions related to those operations. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income
taxes if such distribution exceeds available foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. We do not expect a material impact in any repatriation of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries on our operations since the taxable domestic gains generated by any dividend distributions will be mostly offset with foreign tax credits that arise from income tax paid in our foreign operations, which
we are allowed to compute for domestic income tax purposes.

Commitments and Contingencies 
 Litigation and Other Legal Matters  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company is subject to certain contingent liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company accrues liabilities when it considers probable that
future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. The proceeding-related reserve is based on developments to date and historical information related to actions filed against the Company. As of December 31, 2012, the
Company had established reserves for proceeding-related contingencies of $2,800,197 to cover legal actions against the Company in which its Management has assessed the likelihood of a final adverse outcome as probable. In addition, as of
December 31, 2012 the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain legal actions considered by the Companys management and its legal counsels to be reasonably possible for an aggregate amount up to $4,020,024. 
No loss amount has been accrued for such reasonably possible legal actions of which most significant (individually or in the aggregate)
are described below.  As of December 31, 2012, 530 legal actions were pending in the Brazilian ordinary courts. In
addition, as of December 31, 2012, there were 3,114 cases still pending in Brazilian consumer courts. Filing and pursuing of an action before Brazilian consumer courts do not require the assistance of a lawyer. In most of the cases filed
against the Company, the plaintiffs asserted that the Company was responsible for fraud committed against them, or responsible for damages suffered when purchasing an item on the Companys website, when using MercadoPago, or when the Company
invoiced them.

Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Litigation and Other Legal Matters (Continued)   
 On March 17, 2006, Vintage Denim Ltda., or Vintage, sued the Companys
Brazilian subsidiaries MercadoLivre.com Atividades de Internet Ltda. and eBazar.com.br Ltda. in the 29th Civil Court of the County of S&atilde;o Paulo, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Vintage requested a preliminary injunction
alleging that these subsidiaries were infringing Diesel trademarks and their right of exclusive distribution as a result of sellers listing allegedly counterfeit and original imported Diesel branded clothing through the Brazilian page of the
Companys website, based on Brazilian Industrial Property Law (Law 9,279/96). Vintage sought an order enjoining the sale of Diesel-branded clothing on the Companys platform. A preliminary injunction was granted on April 11, 2006 to
prohibit the offer of Diesel-branded products, and a fine for non-compliance was imposed in the approximate amount of $5,300 per defendant per day of non-compliance. The Company appealed that fine and obtained its suspension in 2006. Because the
appeal of the preliminary injunction failed, in March of 2007, Vintage presented petitions alleging the Companys non-compliance with the preliminary injunction granted to Vintage and requested a fine of approximately $3.5 million against
the Companys subsidiaries, which represents approximately $5,300 per defendant per day of alleged non-compliance since April 2006. In July 2007, the judge ordered the payment of the fine mandated in the preliminary injunction,
without specifying the amount. In September 2007, the judge decided that (i) the Brazilian subsidiaries were not responsible for alleged infringement of intellectual property rights by its users; and that (ii) the plaintiffs did not
prove the alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights. However, the decision maintained the injunction until such ruling is non-appealable. The plaintiff appealed the judges ruling regarding the subsidiarys
non-responsibility and the Company appealed the decision that maintained the preliminary injunction. On July 26, 2011 the State Court of Appeals of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo confirmed the judges ruling regarding our subsidiarys
non-responsibility. The decision on the appeal regarding the decision that maintained the preliminary injunction is still pending on the Superior Court. In the opinion of the Company and its legal counsel, as of December 31, 2012 the amount of
$3.5 million was not reserved since, $3.1 million was considered remote and $0.4 million was considered reasonably possible but not probable.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">State of S&atilde;o Paulo Fraud Claim  On June 12, 2007, a state
prosecutor of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil presented a claim against the Companys Brazilian subsidiary. The state prosecutor alleges that the Brazilian subsidiary should be held liable for any fraud committed by sellers on the
Brazilian version of the Companys website, or responsible for damages suffered by buyers when purchasing an item on the Brazilian version of the MercadoLibre website. On June 26, 2009, the Lower Court Judge ruled in favor of the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo prosecutor, declaring that the Brazilian subsidiary shall be held joint and severally liable for fraud committed by sellers and damages suffered by buyers when using the website, and ordering the Brazilian subsidiary to remove from
the Terms of Service of the Brazilian website any provision limiting the Companys responsibility, with a penalty of approximately $2,500 per day of non-compliance. On June 29, 2009 the Company presented a recourse to the lower court,
which was not granted. On September 29, 2009 the Company presented an appeal and requested to suspend the effects of the ruling issued by the lower court until the appeal is decided by State Court of Appeals, which request was granted on
December 1, 2009. The decision on the appeal is still pending. In the opinion of the Companys management and its legal counsel the risk of loss is reasonably possible.

 City of S&atilde;o Paulo Tax Claim 
In 2007 S&atilde;o Paulo tax authorities have asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary relating to the period from 2005
to 2007 in an approximate amount of $5.9 million according to the exchange rate in effect at that time. In 2007, the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities claim and the tax authorities ruled against the Brazilian
subsidiary. In 2009, the Company presented an appeal to the Conselho Municipal de Tributos or S&atilde;o Paulo Municipal Council of Taxes which reduced the fine. On February 11, 2011, the Company appealed this decision to the C&acirc;maras
Reunidas do Egr&eacute;gio Conselho Municipal de Tributos or Superior Chamber of the S&atilde;o Paulo Municipal Council of Taxes which affirmed the reduction of the fine. As of the date of these financial statements, the total amount of the claim is
approximately $5.8 million including surcharges and interest. With this decision the administrative stage is finished. On August 15, 2011, the Company made a deposit in court of approximately R$ 9.5 million, which including accrued
interests amounted to R$ 10.4 million or $5.1 million, according to the exchange rate at December 31, 2012, and filed a lawsuit in 8th Public Treasury Court of the County of S&atilde;o Paulo, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, to contest
the taxes and fines asserted by the Tax Authorities. The 8th Public Treasury Court of the County of S&atilde;o Paulo ruling is still pending.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In June 2012 S&atilde;o Paulo tax authorities have asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary related to our Brazilian subsidiarys activities in S&atilde;o Paulo for the period from
2007 through 2010 in an approximate amount of R$23 million or $11.3 million according to the exchange rate as of December 31, 2012. On July 27, 2012 the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities claim. The
S&atilde;o Paulo tax authorities ruling is still pending.  In January 2005 the Brazilian subsidiary moved its operations to
Santana de Parna&iacute;ba City, Brazil and began paying taxes to that jurisdiction and therefore we believe we have strong defenses to the claims of the S&atilde;o Paulo authorities with respect to these periods. The Companys management and
its legal counsel believe that the risk of loss is remote, and as a result, has not reserved any provisions for these claims from 2005 through 2010.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Brazilian Federal Tax Claims  On September 2, 2011, the Brazilian
Federal tax authority have asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary relating to the income tax for the 2006 period in an approximate amount of R$5.2 million or $2.5 million, according to the exchange rate at December 31, 2012.
On September 30, 2011 the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities claim. On August 24, 2012 the Company presented its appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals (CARF)Conselho Administrativo de Recursos
Fiscais against the tax authorities claims. The decision on the appeal is still pending. The Companys management and its legal counsel believe that the risk of loss is remote, and as a result, the Company has not reserved any provisions
for this claim.

 State of Rio de Janeiro Customer Service Level Claim 
On August 19, 2011, a state prosecutor of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil presented a claim against the Companys Brazilian
subsidiary. The state prosecutor alleges that the Brazilian subsidiary should improve our customer service level and provide (among other things) a telephone number for customer support and requested an injunction against our Brazilian subsidiary.
On October 22, 2012, a lower court judges ruled in favor of the Company and dismissed the claim against us. The Public Prosecutor appealed the decision and the Company presented its defense on December 12, 2012. The outcome of this matter
is still pending. In the opinion of the Companys management and its legal counsel the risk of loss is remote.  State
of S&atilde;o Paulo Customer Service Level Claim  On September 1, 2010, a state prosecutor of the State of S&atilde;o
Paulo, Brazil presented a claim against the Companys Brazilian subsidiary. The state prosecutor alleges that the Brazilian subsidiary should improve its customer service level and provide (among other things) a telephone number for customer
support. On November 17, 2010, the Judge of the first instance court granted an injunction against the Brazilian subsidiary imposing the obligation to provide customer service over telephone means within 60 days with a penalty of approximately
$65,000 per day of non-compliance. On April 8, 2011, the Company was summoned of the lawsuit and the injunction. On April 14, 2011, the Company presented recourse to the lower court; even though, the injunction was not lifted, an extension
of 30 days was granted, and the non-compliance fine would not start running until July 11, 2011. On April 20, 2011 the Company presented an appeal and requested to suspend the effects of the injunction issued by the lower court until the
appeal is decided by State Court of Appeals which was granted on May 4, 2011. On November 29, 2011, the state prosecutor signed an agreement with the Brazilian subsidiary and presented a motion for dismissal of the case. On
January 16, 2012, Instituto Bar&atilde;o de Mau&aacute; de Defesa de V&iacute;timas e Consumidores contra Entes Poluidores e Maus Fornecedores or The Instituto Bar&atilde;o de Mau&aacute;, a consumer protection entity which had joined the case
as a co-plaintiff, presented a petition manifesting its partial disagreement with the commitments assumed by the Company. On March 22, 2012, the Lower Court Judge ruled in favor of the agreement and dismissed the claim against the Company. The
Instituto Bar&atilde;o de Mau&aacute; did not appeal the decision, therefore the case is closed.  Other third parties have from
time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that the Company was responsible for fraud committed against them, or that the Company has infringed their intellectual property rights. The underlying laws with respect to the potential
liability of online intermediaries like the Company are unclear in the jurisdictions where the Company operates. Management believes that additional lawsuits alleging that the Company has violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against
the Company in the future.  Intellectual property and regulatory claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and
costly to resolve, require significant amounts of management time, could require expensive changes in the Companys methods of doing business, or could require the Company to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements. The Company may be
subject to patent disputes, and be subject to patent infringement claims as the Companys services expand in scope and complexity. In particular, the Company may face additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of the
payments businesses.

 On July 15, 2009, June 25, 2010, August 1, 2011 and June 5, 2012, the board
of directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee approved the 2009, the 2010, 2011 and the 2012 employee retention programs (the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP). The awards under the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP are
fully payable in cash in addition to the annual salary and bonus of each employee.  The 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP will be
paid in 8 equal annual quotas (12.5% each) commencing on March 31, 2010, March 31, 2011, and March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively. Each quota is calculated as follows: 
 


 

 
 6.25% of the amount will be calculated in nominal terms (the nominal basis share), 
 


 

 
 6.25% is adjusted by multiplying the nominal amount by the average closing stock price for the last 60 trading days of the year previous to the payment
date and divided by the average closing stock price for the last 60 trading days of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP, respectively. The average closing stock price for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTRP amounted to
$13.81, $45.75, $65.41 and $77.77, respectively (the variable share).
