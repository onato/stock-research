  BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, November 1, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
  MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America's
  leading e-commerce technology company, today reported financial results for the quarter
  ended September 30, 2018.

  Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented, “I am pleased to
  report another quarter of solid performance in our business, across our key business
  units. During the quarter we have: strengthened our online-to-offline payments offering,
  successfully expanded the financial services portfolio, once again confirmed the great
  resiliency of our marketplace business, and made important strides with the development
  of our proprietary logistics network. All this has translated into a strong top line growth,
  as gross billings grew 48% on an FX neutral basis year over year. And, from a bottom
  line perspective, operating losses showed a 61% reduction versus last quarter as we
  delivered break even EBITDA during Q3”


  Third Quarter 2018 Business Highlights1
               Total payment volume through MercadoPago reached $4.6 billion, a year-over-
                year increase of 24.1% in USD and 69.5% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment
                transactions increased 66.7% year-over-year, totaling 103.9 million for the
                quarter.
               Successful execution in off-platform payments (online and offline) through
                merchant services, mobile point-of-sale devices, and mobile wallet business. On
                a consolidated basis, off-platform total payment volume grew 87.8% year-over-
                year in USD and 163.3% on an FX neutral basis.
               In September for the first time ever MercadoPago not only processed more total
                payment transactions off-platform than on MELI’s marketplaces, but total
                payment transactions surpassed the hundred million mark in a single quarter.
               Mobile-point-of-sale business is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing non-
                marketplace business unit, representing 46.5% of total off-platform payment
                volume for the quarter and growing total payment volume on a consolidated basis
                636% Year-over-year on an FX neutral basis.
               Mobile wallet reached 1 million active payers during the month of September,
                while total payment volume from mobile wallet in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico
                is growing triple digits year-over-year.
               Launched asset management in Argentina, the first country where we have begun
                to offer the entire suite of fintech solutions: mobile point-of-sales devices, QR
                codes in store payments, mobile wallet, and asset management.

      Percentages have been calculated using whole amounts rather than rounded amounts.
   Gross merchandise volume reached almost $3 billion, a 2.6% year-over-year
    decrease in USD, and a 27.9% year-over-year increase on an FX neutral basis.
   Items sold reached 83.5 million, growing 12.5% year-over-year versus 55.7%
    during the same period last year. The decrease year-over-year deceleration is
    attributable to Brazil with the launch of R$ 5 flat fee on items below R$ 120 and
    the removal of listings below R$ 6 as we shift incentives for buyers to purchase
    higher ticket items.
   Unique buyers grew 9.4% year-over-year versus 16.0% in the second quarter. This
    declining growth rate is attributable primarily to pricing adjustments we have
    done in our value proposition, including eliminating low priced ticket items from
    our platform and making payments mandatory in Chile and Colombia which also
    affects buyer growth temporarily.
   Live listings offered on MercadoLibre’s marketplace grew to 168.1 million in the
    third quarter of 2018, a 58.8% year-over-year increase, surpassing for the second
    time the 150 million mark.
   Mobile gross merchandise volume penetration grew 19.5% year-over-year
    reaching 58.1%.
   Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos reached 54.3 million, a 30.2% year-over-
    year increase, driven primarily by increasing our free shipping program. Items
    shipped in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia were highlights of the quarter,
    growing 74.4%, 99.4%, 146.7%, and 83.4% respectively year-over-year.
   MercadoLibre launched its MELI Flex logistics solution, enabling our sellers to
    adopt proprietary technology and leverage their existing logistics relationships
    with small carriers to deliver products within hours in large metropolitan areas
    within the MercadoEnvíos network.


Adoption of ASC 606
   Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from
    Contracts with Customers related to revenue recognition (“ASC 606”) issued by
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has adopted
    ASC 606 using the full retrospective transition method and has accordingly
    revised its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
    2017, and applicable interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2017,
    as if ASC 606 had been effective for those periods. Because the Company did not
    offer free shipping in 2016, net revenue for that year does not need to be recast.
   As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company must present net revenue net of
    amounts paid in connection with the Company’s free shipping initiative rather
    than including these amounts in the cost of net sales, as previously recorded. For
    the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 the Company incurred $107.6
    million of shipping subsidies that have been netted from revenues.
   As a result of adopting ASC 606, our net revenues for the periods indicated below
    have been recast as presented below. Our adoption of 606 does not affect our
    operating or net income/loss.

             the third quarter of 2017. Most of the gross margin compression is attributed to
             an increase in free shipping subsidies.
            Total operating expenses were $180.7 million, up 21.9% year-over-year. As a
             percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 50.9%, as compared to 48.6%

            Interest income was $8.6 million, a 39.2% decrease year-over-year as a, mainly
             attributable to a $5.6 million decrease from our financial investments as a result
             of Argentine Peso devaluation and lower float in Argentina.
            The company incurred $15.9 million in financial expenses in the third quarter of
             2018 mainly attributable to financial interest related to the 2028 Convertible Notes
             and financial loans in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
            The foreign exchange gains for the third quarter of 2018 were of $3.9 million,
             mainly as a consequence of a $5.1 million gain arising from the U.S. Dollar
             revaluation over our Argentine Peso net liability position in Argentina, partially
             offset by a $1.3 million loss arising from the appreciation of the Mexican Peso
             over our U.S. Dollar net asset position in Mexico.
            Net loss before taxes was $14.3 million, down 139.0% year-over-year.

             loss per share of $0.23.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-GAAP
measure.
     This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different
from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure
is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP
measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with
our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP
financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction
with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
    Reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables included in this
quarterly report.

    The Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current
financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe this non-
GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by
excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our
core operating results and business outlook.

     The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange
rates for each month during 2017 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2018,
so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable
from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects.
Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment
to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.
     The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results
of the operations for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018:
