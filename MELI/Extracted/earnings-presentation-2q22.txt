General Performance
• Credit portfolio continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace of originations in the second quarter, leading to growth in Total Past Due/Portfolio ratios for
   loans >30 and >90 days past due as the previous cohorts age into the book.
• Product mix also plays a role in Non-Performing Loan growth as the credit card gains share in the overall portfolio and is still adding new NPLs from
   newer cohorts.
• Past Dues are well provisioned (and reflected in current IMAL spreads), maintaining the quarterly allowance for doubtful accounts rates of the portfolio
   at 11.3%, slightly above prior quarters.
• Total allowance for doubtful accounts cover 172% of non-performing loans over 90 days, well above sector averages. Current accounting rules
   stipulate provisioning for newly originated credits that are yet to become due, and increasingly so as loans roll into past d ue.

Fintech revenues are generated from payments fees. Regarding our Mercado Pago service, we generate payment fees attributable to: commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off
Marketplace platform transactions; commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; commissions from additional fees we
charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; commissions that we charge from transactions carried out with Mercado Pago credit and debit cards; interest cash advances and fees from merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado Credito solution;
and revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products and insurtech fees.
