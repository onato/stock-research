                     •   Mercado Libre delivered YoY growth of 30% in net revenue, 44% in income from
                         operations and 76% in net income, on a comparable basis, in Q1’24. This was due
                         to outstanding results in Brazil and Mexico, which offset weakness in Argentina.


Key Messages         •   Commerce momentum remains strong: YoY FX-neutral GMV growth in Brazil (30%)
                         and Mexico (30%) was solid, even against high comps, whilst Argentina’s growth of
                         214% was below inflation. Overall, total GMV grew 20% YoY (in USD).
First Quarter 2024
                     •   Growing engagement with Fintech Services. MAU* growth accelerated to 38% YoY
                         in Q1’24 from 32% in Q4’23 with strong performance in all geographies. AUM** grew
                         90% YoY with users 3x higher YoY in Mexico, 2x in Argentina and almost 2x in Brazil.

                     •   Solid growth and spreads in Credits. Mercado Pago’s credit portfolio grew 46% YoY
                         and reached $4.4bn, with the credit card being the main driver of growth. NIMAL***
                         of 31.5% was up slightly YoY, despite the negative mix impact of the credit card.

                     •   Acquiring growth remained resilient. Acquiring TPV of almost $31bn grew 26% YoY
                         in USD, with accelerating FX-neutral growth in Brazil and Mexico offsetting a decline
                         in TPV (in USD) in Argentina following the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.


                     •   As detailed in the appendix of this presentation, and in our upcoming quarterly report on Form
                         10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2024, Mercado Pago’s interest income & expense
                         lines have been reclassified to net revenue and cost of net revenue, whilst changes to
                         Mercado Envios’ terms & conditions mean that more shipping revenue is now booked on a
                         gross basis (“Principal”) rather than on a net basis (“Agent”). Finally, we now exclude internal
                         Mercado Pago peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers from our TPV definition. For purposes of
                         comparison, financial figures in this presentation are presented on a reported basis as well as
                         a “comparable basis", which excludes the impact of the aforementioned reporting updates.

                         *MAU refers to Monthly Active Users; **AUM refers to Assets Under Management;***NIMAL refers to net interest margin
                         after losses, which is credit revenues (APRs and late fees) net of provisions for doubtful accounts and funding costs.   MercadoLibre, Inc. I 4

    FX-neutral GMV growth in Argentina was below

Q1’24 RESULTS



Changes in Mercado Envios’ Terms & Conditions
As a result of changes to Mercado Envios Terms & Conditions (T&C), certain shipping revenue will now be recognized on the basis of Mercado Libre acting as Principal (where previously
it acted as Agent). This means that revenue is recognized on a gross basis, with any associated costs booked as cost of net revenue (as opposed to these revenues previously being
booked net of costs when Mercado Libre was considered to be acting as Agent).

To aid investors, the table below shows costs that in 2023 were netted against revenue because Mercado Libre was considered to be acting as Agent under the prior Mercado Envios
T&C. Had our current Mercado Envios T&C been in place at the time, revenue would have been recognized on a gross basis and these costs would have been booked as costs of net
revenue.

                       The update to our Mercado Envios T&Cs, and, as a result, the shift in the recognition of these costs, occurred in mid-January in Brazil and
                       mid-March in our Hispanic markets. The “Q1’23 (partial)” column below shows costs for the same time period, whereas the
                       “Q1’23 (full)” column shows the same costs for a full quarter. The “Q1’24” column shows the costs that were booked as cost of net revenue
                       for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

                       Mercado Libre will continue to be considered as acting as “Agent” for some shipping transactions, mainly for commercial carriers. The
                       changes described above do not apply to these carrier costs and, as such, they will continue to be netted against revenue.
