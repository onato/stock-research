Third Quarter Results

MercadoLibre reported consolidated net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2008 of $40.3 million, a quarterly
year over year revenue growth rate of 76.6%. Third quarter marketplace revenue grew 75.0% to $31.7 million from $18.1
million for the prior year third quarter. Payments revenues grew to $8.5 million for the third quarter, up 82.9% from $4.7 million
for the same period during 2007.

Revenue growth was primarily driven by 49.4% and 87.0% growth over the same period during the prior year in gross
merchandise volume and total payment volume respectively. Strong results in the classifieds and ad sales businesses as well
as take-rate improvements during the quarter also contributed to revenue growth for the quarter.

Gross profit grew 79.2% to $32.1 million from $17.9 million in the prior year third quarter. Gross profit margin improved to
79.7% from 78.6% in the third quarter of 2007.

Income from operations grew 85.4% to $11.7 million from $6.3 million for the same period during 2007. Excluding certain long-
term retention plan costs, income from operations would have grown 88.9% to $11.9 million.

Net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2008 was $5.9 million, compared to $2.8 million during the same
period of 2007, an increase of 110.9%. Excluding certain long-term retention plan costs net income for the period would have
grown 117.7% to $6.1 million from $2.8 million for the same period during the previous year.

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 77.9% to $103.6 million compared with $58.2 million for the
prior year period.

Gross profit increased 79.9% to $82.5 million from $45.9 million from the prior year period, representing a gross profit margin
of 79.7% for fiscal 2008 year to date, compared to 78.8% in 2007.

Income from operations increased 86.9% to $26.4 million from $14.1 million in the previous year. Income from operations
includes $1.9 million of compensation costs related to the Classifieds Media Group (CMG) acquisition and $0.2 million of
certain costs related to the company's long-term compensation plan. Excluding these charges, income from operations for the
first nine months of 2008 would have grown 102.1% to $28.5 million.

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $10.9 million, compared to $4.4 million for the prior year
period, an increase of 149.2%. Net income for the period excluding acquisition related compensation and certain long-term
retention plan costs would have grown 197.4% to $13.0 million.

Earnings per share for the first nine months of 2008, both basic and diluted, were $0.25 earnings per share. Earnings per
share for the same period, excluding acquisition related compensation and certain long-term retention plans costs would have

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Rules to supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP.

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be
different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any
comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with MercadoLibre's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release can be found in
the tables included at the end of this press release.

These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors overall understanding of the company's current financial
performance. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and
investors by excluding certain non-recurring compensation expenses that may not be indicative of its core operating results,
thereby enhancing an investor's ability to make period over period comparisons of the company's results. The company
believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting and uses these
measures in internal budgets and models and in determining executive compensation benchmarks.

In this press release MercadoLibre includes each of income from operations, net income and earnings per basic and diluted
share for the nine month ended September 30, 2008 after excluding (or adding back) the following charge required by GAAP:

Compensation Costs Related to Acquisitions: This amount relates to the purchase price of the shares of CMG and its
subsidiaries. Under EITF 95-8 "Accounting for Contingent Consideration Paid to the Shareholders of an Acquired Enterprise in
a Purchase Business Combination", we have recognized a contingent consideration paid to former shareholders as
compensation for services. Total compensation paid in cash amounts to $1,919,870, for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2008. This compensation was paid out in the second quarter of 2008. The following tables show a reconciliation
of this exclusion from the GAAP measures to the non GAAP measures.

Long term retention plan compensation: On August 8, 2008, the Board of Directors approved an employee retention program
that will be payable 50% in cash and 50% in shares, in addition to the annual salary and bonus of certain executives. Payments
will be made, in equal parts stock and cash, during the first quarter on annual basis according to the following vesting
schedule: year 1 (2008): 17%, year 2 (2009): 22%, year 3 (2010): 27%, year 4 (2011): 34%.

As described above, these costs will be a recurring expense to the company over the life of the retention plan.

The U.S. GAAP compensation cost is recognized in accordance with the graded-vesting attribution method and is accrued up
to each payment day. The non-GAAP measures for the third quarter of 2008 were calculated based on the simple vesting
schedule described above, in which 17% of the cost of the plan vests during the first year. The following tables show a
reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures.
