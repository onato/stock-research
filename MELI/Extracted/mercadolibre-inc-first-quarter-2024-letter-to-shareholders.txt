͏MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; May 2nd, 2024 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin
 America’s leading e-commerce and technology company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended

            Net revenues and financial income of $4.3 billion, up 36% year-over-year
                                and 94% on an FX neutral basis
                  Income from operations of $528 million, with a 12.2% margin
                        Net income of $344 million, with a 7.9% margin

                                             basis
    To our Shareholders

  As we kick-off our 25th anniversary year, we are as optimistic as ever about the growth potential of Mercado
  Libre. As Latin America's largest ecommerce and fintech platform, we believe that we are uniquely placed to
  capitalize on the structural shifts that are transforming the region's commerce and financial services markets.
  Over the last few years we have shown our ability to scale the business to fully take advantage of these
  opportunities, whilst delivering continued profitability. Q1'24 is an example of our continued success on this
  front, with revenue of $4.3bn growing strongly in both Commerce and Fintech, and net income up 71% YoY to
  $344mn, driven by excellent results in Brazil and Mexico.

    Commerce

  Our strong performance in Q1'24 demonstrates the sustainability of growth in our Commerce operations. FX-
  neutral GMV growth remained strong in Brazil (30% YoY) and Mexico (30% YoY), led by items sold growth of
  32% YoY and 28% YoY, respectively. This was despite high comps and Easter falling in Q1 this year (versus Q2
  last year). Through our consistent investment in technology over many years, we have developed a world
  class user experience and a leading e-commerce value proposition, which continues to strengthen. This has
  resulted in competitive NPS metrics reaching record levels across countries in Q1'24, higher conversion rates
  across all of our sites, and unique active buyers growing 25% YoY in Mexico and 18% YoY in Brazil. We have
  also seen record levels of retention after six, nine and twelve months from our 2023 cohorts. This indicates
  how we have positioned Mercado Libre as the leader in facilitating the shift of offline spending online, which
  should drive long-term growth.

  Our initiatives to improve selection are also driving growth across verticals, particularly Fashion, Consumer
  Electronics and Supermarket. Our on-platform payments initiatives are also bearing fruit, with "split
  payments" (the ability to use two forms of payment together) launched in Q1'24 in Brazil and Mexico, and the
  penetration of Mercado Pago payment methods rising consistently.

  We continue to see good traction with MELI+, our loyalty program. Users who enroll in the program increase
  their spending and buying frequency and shop across more categories than prior to enrollment. Engagement
  with MELI Delivery Day has exceeded our expectations, which shows we have succeeded in creating a
  compelling shipping benefit for the loyalty scheme, which is helping us to have a more competitive offer in low
  ASP ranges whilst maintaining discipline in our P&L. We are optimistic about the impact of MELI+ on future
  growth and retention as the user base continues to scale.

  Our focus on operational excellence in our shipping network resulted in late deliveries reaching record lows,
  whilst the average speed of our delivery promises is close to record highs in Q1'24, despite initiatives like MELI
  Delivery Day reducing average speed. This was helped by an increase in fulfillment penetration of almost
  8ppts YoY, which means we surpassed the 50% mark for the first time in Q1'24, reaching an average of 52%.
  We have been able to keep the cost per package of fulfilled orders broadly stable YoY, with the gap against
  other delivery types narrowing as we continue to pursue productivity, efficiency and scale gains.


                                                                                                                       1
                                                                                           Q1’24 Results


As we think about our future growth, we will continue to invest in our logistics network as fast and reliable
shipping is core to our value proposition and a key competitive advantage. We consider the intensity of these
investments to be business as usual (rather than a step-change) to support growth.

Our Advertising business had another strong quarter, growing revenues 64% YoY and reaching a penetration
of 1.9% of GMV (up 50bps YoY). We saw improvements in all major markets, with Mexico standing out,
particularly in cross-border. We continued to deploy initiatives in Q1'24 to drive monetization, such as
improved algorithms, better placements and new use cases. At the same time, we continue to attract new
users to the platform. Most of our Ads revenue continues to come from Products Ads, and we see a
tremendous long-term growth opportunity in Brand and Display Ads, as well as Video Ads as Mercado Play
gains traction. We remain optimistic about the long-term contribution of our Advertising business to the
monetization of our platform.

Argentina had a difficult quarter in Commerce, with FX-neutral GMV growth of 214% YoY, below inflation, and
items sold decreasing by 4% YoY. However, our marketplace model is resilient to this type of macro situation,
so the business has outperformed wider consumption trends in Argentina. This strengthens our long-term
position in the country. Furthermore, our diversification across geographies - with stellar performance in Brazil
and Mexico, and improving momentum in Chile (items sold +21% YoY, accelerating for the fourth consecutive
quarter) - enabled us to deliver solid consolidated GMV growth of 20% YoY.


  Fintech Services

Mercado Pago's position continued to strengthen in Q1'24, with monthly active users ("MAUs") reaching 49mn
and growth accelerating to 38% YoY from 32% YoY in Q4'23. We are seeing better retention and an increase
in the average number of products used on our platform in our more recent cohorts. These higher user and
engagement trends are particularly strong in Brazil. These are indications of the strength of our value
proposition and our ability to cross-sell, both of which are crucial as we increase principality amongst a
growing portion of our user base.

Assets under management ("AUM") grew strongly (+90% YoY) in Q1'24. AUM more than doubled YoY in Brazil
and Mexico, and grew at 64% YoY in Argentina despite the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Asset
management is a good entry door to our fintech platform, and in Q1'24, users of this product doubled YoY in
Argentina and tripled in Mexico. Brazil also showed strong growth, helped by the recent launch of the Conta
Turbinada, which offers the highest remuneration in the market (if the user deposits at least R$1,000 in a given
month) and contributed to improvements in the NPS of the Mercado Pago account. We are also seeing
encouraging results in Insurtech, with more than 11mn active policies and 8.1mn users.

We are uniquely positioned to offer credit products to our users profitably as the relationships and data from
our ecosystem provide competitive advantages in distribution and underwriting. We had another strong
performance in our credit business in Q1'24 with originations growing at 71% YoY and a portfolio of $4.4bn at
the end of the quarter, up 46% YoY. Our confidence to pursue a slightly faster pace of growth is explained by
robust asset quality indicators, good results from our efforts to explore new use cases amongst existing users
of our consumer loans, and solid performance of the most recent cohorts of credit cards in Brazil and Mexico.

The Mercado Pago credit card is strategically important as it expands the addressable market of our fintech
platform by catering to higher income demographics and driving improvements in frequency and engagement
in Fintech and Commerce. In Q1'24 we issued more than 1.5mn new cards in Brazil and Mexico and credit card
TPV grew 173% YoY (FX-neutral) as we continue to improve our scoring models and the portfolio's economics.

Our credit business continues to be very profitable, and delivered a NIMAL spread of 31.5% in Q1'24. This is up
YoY despite a headwind from a larger share of the lower-NIMAL credit card in the portfolio (35% in Q1'24 vs.
22% in Q1'23). Asset quality remained robust with 90+ NPLs decreasing by 80bps from last quarter and 10ppts
from a year ago. The increase in the 15-90 day NPL from 8.2% in Q4'23 to 9.3% in Q1'24 is mostly because of
the timing of Easter, meaning the quarter ended with four days of holidays, which reduced collection activity. A
shift in the mix of risk cohorts - which has been appropriately priced for - also contributed.

  Acquiring

We have big ambitions for our Acquiring business across geographies, and we have built solid foundations on
which to pursue those ambitions. With more than two decades of experience of processing payments in Latin
America, we have built a competitive, cost efficient platform with our proprietary acquiring engine at its core.

Our Acquiring business also had a very strong quarter, with TPV growing 26% YoY. Growth was driven by
Brazil and Mexico, which offset headwinds from Argentina. In Brazil, with FX-neutral Acquiring TPV growth
improving to 31% YoY, we saw a re-acceleration of both online and offline TPV. Mexico delivered another
quarter of triple-digit FX-neutral growth in POS, as we continue to execute well in a country where we consider
ourselves to be driving the digitalization of payments. We see large market share opportunities in both
markets, which we expect to drive future growth. Argentina's performance was resilient despite the tough
macro environment, with FX-neutral Acquiring TPV up 318% YoY, growing in real terms. This points to the
strong traction that our brand has in Argentina, which is an asset that we continue to leverage.

In Brazil we launched our Point Smart 2, a device with significantly longer battery life and faster processing, to
continue moving upmarket to serve larger merchants. In the long tail, our device-free Point Tap solution saw a
63% rise in the number of sellers who used it during Q1. In Online Payments, the number of logged payers
grew by 35% YoY, resulting in record high Net Promoter Scores from payers in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.



  Reporting Updates

Before turning to the detail of our Q1'24 financial results, we would like to highlight some updates to our
reporting. These updates are intended to better reflect the reality of each of our business models and how
they operate. The first update is the exclusion of internal Mercado Pago peer-to-peer transfers from our TPV
(approximately $7bn in Q1'24), which we believe creates a more relevant metric for investors to track a
business that has evolved from a payments wallet into a full fintech services platform.

The second update reclassifies Mercado Pago interest income and expense lines from below income from
operations to above income from operations. These revenues and costs are operational in nature in a fintech
business model, so this update enhances disclosure and makes Mercado Pago's reporting consistent with
peers. In Q1'24, this reclassification led to an increase of $99mn in net revenue and $44mn in cost of revenue
with a net positive impact of $55mn on gross profit and income from operations. The reclassification has no
impact on net income. For comparative purposes, we have recast our 2023 financials in our 10-Q.

The final update relates to Mercado Envios, where a change to our terms & conditions shifts our role to
"Principal" in a majority of shipping transactions. Shipping revenues in such transactions are booked on a
gross basis, with associated expenses booked in cost of revenue (rather than netted against revenue when
acting as "Agent"). This had a positive impact of $293mn on net revenue and a negative impact of $308mn on
cost of revenue, with a small net negative impact of $15mn on gross profit and income from operations and
$10mn on net income. Despite being almost neutral to profitability, there is some dilution to operating and net
income margins because of higher net revenue. Given this change follows our existing accounting policies,
2023 financials have not been recast.

  Consolidated Financial Results

We started the year with great momentum as net revenue of $4,333mn grew 36% YoY on a reported basis (or
30% if we exclude the reporting updates discussed above). Growth was driven by particularly strong trends in
Brazil (+57% YoY; +44% excluding reporting updates) and Mexico (+59% YoY; +55% excluding reporting
updates) which more than offset the impact of the devaluation and weak macro trends in Argentina (-22% YoY;
-19% excluding reporting updates). Revenue growth was robust in both Commerce (+49% YoY; +31% excluding
reporting updates) and Fintech (+22% YoY; +28% excluding reporting updates).

Income from operations reached $528mn on a reported basis, growing 26% YoY against Q1'23 figures that
have been recast to reflect the reclassification of Mercado Pago interest income and expenses. If we were to
exclude the impact of reporting updates from Q1'24 and Q1'23 to help investors compare with the numbers we
reported last year, income from operations would have grown 44% YoY to $488mn. YoY growth is lower on a
reported basis because the reclassified interest income & expense declined, primarily related to Argentina.

Our geographies outside of Argentina delivered excellent results, with YoY income from operations margin
expansion of 560bps (as detailed in our Q1'24 investor presentation) on a reported basis. This was due to
higher Ads penetration, better profitability in Credits and 1P, and dilution of Sales & Marketing, G&A and
Product Development expenses.

The Q1'24 consolidated income from operations margin of 12.2% declined by 90bps YoY when compared to
Q1'23 recast figures. This includes the following headwinds from reporting updates: a) 120bps from the
increase in shipping revenue booked on a gross basis; and b) 90bps due to the YoY decline in reclassified
Mercado Pago interest income & expenses. So on an underlying basis - which excludes reporting updates and
compares with figures disclosed last year - the margin would have improved by 120bps YoY (as detailed in our
Q1'24 investor presentation).

This 120bps margin improvement is a combination of a 620bps margin gain from the strong performance of
geographies outside Argentina, which more than offsets the 500bps compression from Argentina. This strong
performance more than offset the following headwinds on the consolidated P&L: a) investments in shipping, b)
credit provisions; and c) Argentina's performance in Q1'24.

As expected, logistics cost pressures from peak season in Q4'23 subsided in Q1'24, so net shipping costs fell
by approximately $90mn QoQ. This is an improvement of 20bps as a percentage of GMV, which would have
been 50bps without incremental pressure from Argentina.

Fulfillment and free shipping are key components of our value proposition and investments in these areas led
to a 60bps YoY increase in net shipping costs as a percentage of GMV in Q1'24. The successful adoption of
MELI+ resulted in higher free shipping penetration (+6ppts YoY) and accounted for 20bps of this overall cost
increase. Our investments in fulfillment, whose penetration surpassed 50% in Q1'24, accounted for the other
40bps. Cost pressures have been mitigated by last year's Flat Fee increase and progress on improving
productivity. We have a solid track record of mitigating shipping cost increases since 2018, despite major
investments in service levels.

The growth of our credit business also put some pressure on margins as provisions for doubtful accounts
increased by 70bps as a percentage of sales in Q1'24 on a reported basis (120bps excluding the impact of
reporting updates). Part of this increase relates to mix, with Argentina - where provisions are lowest - losing
share in our revenue because of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. The remainder was the natural
consequence of the faster pace of sequential growth in Q1'24 compared to a year ago, given that we provision
100% of expected losses at the moment of origination, with revenue recognized over the lifetime of the loan.

The table below - which we have disclosed since Q2'23 to help investors understand the financials exposed to
a devaluation - highlights the operating deleverage in Argentina, with a 68% YoY decline in reported income
from operations in Argentine Pesos. This was due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, GMV growth
below inflation and significantly higher costs in shipping, amongst other pressures. The remainder of the
business delivered an outstanding performance, with 136% YoY growth in income from operations. The share
of Argentina in our total income from operations has fallen to less than 15% from more than 50% a year ago.

We think net income provides investors with the clearest view of the business' underlying profitability trends,
given the impact of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Net income grew 71% YoY to $344mn in Q1'24 with
a margin of 7.9%, or 9.0% excluding reporting updates. As such, our net income margin has risen by 500bps
over the last two years on revenue that has almost doubled. This is primarily due to strong growth and
profitability gains in Brazil and Mexico, which is a result of the combination of growth, scale and operational
efficiency that drove operating leverage in Q1'24. Whilst the devaluation of the Argentine Peso negatively
impacts income from operations, it also reduces FX losses as the distortions created by the country's dual FX
rate regime begin to normalize. FX losses fell to $34mn in Q1'24 (of which $21mn relate to cash repatriation)
from $107mn in Q4'23 and $87mn in Q1'23. Our net income therefore grew at a faster pace than income from
operations, underlining the resilience and excellent performance of the business.

Capex investments totaled $148mn in Q1'24, similar to previous quarters, as we continue to steadily invest in
our logistics network. Debt ratios have improved on the back of our strong results and cash flow over the last
12 months, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA falling to 0.5x in Q1’24 from 1.25x a year ago.



  Looking Ahead

As we kick off our 25th anniversary year, Mercado Libre is in great shape. Over the last two and a half
decades, we have built a profitable business with solid foundations and leadership positions across Latin
America. This puts us in a position of considerable strength in a region that offers immense opportunities for
growth. In Commerce, we still see plenty of opportunity for more buyers, more frequency and more retail to
shift online; in Fintech, we see substantial demand for better and simpler financial services, as well as the
trend of digitalization of cash. By investing in technology and driving innovation as we look forward to our next
25 years, Mercado Libre intends to continue to be at the forefront of efforts to capture those secular growth
opportunities. We are optimistic about MercadoLibre's growth potential and its long-term profitability. After all,
we believe the best is yet to come.

  Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance


 To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and
other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt and foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
measures as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the
most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure
provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the
future.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the
effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense
and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an
unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our
Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation
of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it
provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain
items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial
liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities
restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have
included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current
leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance
sheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to
investors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its
capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used
measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

FX neutral

We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by
excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results
and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have
been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2024:
