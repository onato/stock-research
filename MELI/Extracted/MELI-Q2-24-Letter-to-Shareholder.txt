͏MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay; August 1st, 2024 -- MercadoLibre, Inc. (Nasdaq: MELI) (http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin
 America’s leading e-commerce and fintech company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30,
 2024.


         Net revenues & financial income of $5.1 billion, up 42% YoY and 113% FX-neutral
                  Income from operations of $726 million, with a 14.3% margin
                          Net income of $531 million, with a 10.5% margin
              $46.3 billion Total Payment Volume, up 36% YoY and 86% FX-neutral
           $12.6 billion Gross Merchandise Volume, up 20% YoY and 83% FX-neutral



     To our Shareholders

  We delivered a great financial and operational performance in Q2'24, with growth in GMV, Acquiring TPV and
  the Credits portfolio accelerating in all three major geographies on a YoY FX-neutral basis. Unique buyer
  growth also accelerated and Fintech MAU surpassed 50mn for the first time. Our ecosystem is gaining more
  traction, and our investments in product, technology and service levels are extending our position as the
  region's leading ecommerce and fintech platform.

  At the same time, we are delivering strong financial results both at the top line - with Q2'24 revenue growth of
  42% YoY (of which 14ppts relates to the shipping reporting updates outlined in Q1'24) - and at the bottom line,
  with net income rising 103% YoY to $531mn. Our net income margin reached 10.5% in Q2'24, up 3ppts YoY
  and at the highest level since Q1'17.


    Commerce

  FX-neutral GMV growth in Q2'24 was outstanding in Brazil where it accelerated to 36% YoY even on a high
  base. Mexico was also strong, up 30% YoY, and initiatives to incentivize consumption in Argentina led to items
  sold returning to YoY growth. We are driving offline retail online by creating a superior experience for buyers
  and sellers, and this is the major source of our growth. Unique buyer growth of 19% YoY - the fastest pace
  since Q2'21 - is testament to that. We believe that the continued expansion of our user base sets us up well for
  future growth as buyers purchase more items across more categories over time. We see this in the number of
  buyers that purchase three or more categories per quarter - which reached record highs for a second quarter
  in Q2'24 - and in the growth of items purchased per buyer. This all contributed to items sold rising 29% YoY,
  the highest growth since Q2'21. LatAm ecommerce penetration is still low relative to other regions and these
  figures show Mercado Libre in a unique position to be a driving force of this structural growth opportunity.

  We continue to raise the bar for buyers and sellers through investment, innovation and execution. In Q2'24,
  fulfillment penetration - which enables faster delivery for buyers and higher conversion for sellers - jumped
  8ppts YoY in Brazil, and free shipping rose 4ppts YoY for MELI as a whole. This was helped by MELI+, which
  continues to scale. Delivery speed promises reached record levels in Brazil and Colombia in Q2'24, and our
  data shows we have the fastest delivery across major cities in the region, including São Paulo and Mexico City.

  To enhance our cross-border value proposition, we opened a fulfillment center in Texas to offer inventory from
  US sellers to buyers in Mexico. As we continue to innovate, we introduced immediate AI-generated answers to
  questions in product pages, launched gift lists and included more personalization of incentives such as
  coupons. We expanded our apparel and beauty assortment by onboarding hundreds of sellers from clothing
  manufacturing hubs in Brazil, and by launching premium brands such as Hugo Boss in Brazil and Kerastase in
  Brazil and Mexico.



                                                                                                               2
                                                                                            Q2’24 Results


Sellers are also investing more to complement our promotions and campaigns and to capitalize on Mercado
Libre's growing audience and frequency. As a result, we had record levels of promotional coverage in Brazil in
Q2'24 and in Mexico during the Hot Sale in May. Our social tools are gaining traction as they leverage the
marketplace's strong momentum and growing audience, with thousands of new partners joining our Affiliates
program to promote products on their social media. The coverage of GMV with our short-format Clips videos is
rising rapidly and the number of engaged viewers is almost 4x higher than a year ago.

Our Ads business continues to scale, with revenue equivalent to 2.0% of GMV (+40bps YoY) and growing 51%
YoY in Q2'24. The growing user base and frequency of our marketplace strengthens our Ads business as it
enables advertisers to target larger audiences on an increasingly granular basis with our first-party data. The
core on-platform business continues to see strong momentum as a result of continuous improvements in our
product, display and brand ads formats. We are also seeing encouraging early signs in video ads with monthly
active users of Mercado Play - our free streaming platform for third-party content - growing above 20% month-
on-month throughout Q2'24, less than 12 months after its launch as a startup within the company.

In early July, we started the development of our off-platform business with our first external partnership which
serves programmatic video ads within the new ad-supported version of Disney+. This is the beginning of a
very exciting journey for Mercado Ads, with more external display and video partnerships to come.


  Fintech Services

The influx of users into Mercado Pago shows its central position as a key player in financial services, with MAU
up 37% YoY to 52mn in Q2'24. We are seeing higher levels of engagement in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico
with heavy users growing at a faster pace, the number of products per user rising consistently and higher
levels of retention in recent cohorts.

One of the pillars of our value proposition is the remunerated account, which pays interest as soon as funds
are deposited with immediate liquidity. Its success has been clear in Argentina, with users tripling and USD
AUM more than doubling in the last 18 months. We see similar signs of momentum in Brazil with millions of
new users attracted to our "conta turbinada", which offers the highest remuneration in the market. This helped
Brazil MAU grow 46% YoY in Q2'24 and contributed to an 86% YoY rise in total MELI AUM to $6.6bn. With
strong results in Argentina and Brazil that show clear, positive downstream impacts from offering market-
leading remuneration, we announced in early July that we would extend this strategy to Mexico with 15%
annual account remuneration.

We see huge opportunities for Mercado Pago in Mexico. In June, we announced our intention to apply for a
banking license, which will enable us to scale the business to achieve our ambition of being the number one
digital bank in the country. Our ecosystem will be central to the strategy, and it has already proven to be a
major contributor to Mercado Pago's early progress in Mexico as the largest Fintech in terms of MAUs with
solid NPS and a profitable credit portfolio that exceeded $1.5bn in Q2'24.

Credit performed well across the region in Q2’24, with portfolio growth picking up again to 51% YoY, taking
the book to $4.9bn. The credit card continues to be the main contributor to growth on the back of 1.6mn new
cards issued in Brazil and Mexico and upselling existing users to larger, more competitive credit lines in Brazil.
The fast pace of growth is grounded in robust and stable asset quality metrics and the rising accuracy of our
underwriting models. For the credit card, we are primarily targeting our large ecosystem audience where we
have an underwriting edge and seamless integration, which enhances the user experience. Credit card TPV
growth (FX-neutral) accelerated to 208% YoY in Q2'24 with a majority of the volume originating off-platform,
indicating progress on the path to principality. The encouraging performance of the credit card is strategically
important as it is another key pillar of Mercado Pago's long-term value proposition. We continue to see strong
demand for our other loan products, with more than 6mn additional users in our Consumer portfolio YoY, and
a 1mn YoY increase in users in the Merchant portfolio.




                                                                                                               3
                                                                                           Q2’24 Results


NIMAL remains healthy for each of the consumer, merchant and credit card portfolios, but the consolidated
NIMAL of 31.1% was down 5.7ppts YoY due to a mix shift towards the credit card. Spreads on the credit card
are structurally lower than our other loan products, but it is complementary and incremental to our portfolio
and strategically important since it leads to positive ecosystemic behavior such as more purchasing on the
marketplace and higher engagement with our Fintech platform. Furthermore, the 15-90 day NPL of 8.2% in
Q2'24 was 110bps lower QoQ due to improvement in the consumer and credit card portfolios, highlighting that
asset quality remains robust.

Insurtech is scaling well with the number of active policies growing almost 100% YoY in Q2'24. We believe this
is a fantastic product to cross-sell in our ecosystem. It is now easier for buyers to access extended warranties
after making them available to purchase as part of the shopping cart. This contributed to record performance
in Q2 driven by the Hot Sale in Mexico and Argentina, with 2.6mn policies sold. NPS is on a positive trend, and
revenue contribution from off-marketplace insurance products - such as card and personal accident insurance
- reached record highs in Q2'24.

  Acquiring

Acquiring TPV reached almost $34bn in Q2'24, up 24% YoY or 75% on an FX-neutral basis with Argentina,
Brazil and Mexico each showing faster growth than in Q1'24. The move upmarket to serve larger merchants in
our POS business continues to bear fruit with TPV per device growing at a double-digit rate. This trend is
strongest in Mexico, where we have seen encouraging sales of our more sophisticated devices and the scale
of off-platform TPV decoupling from marketplace TPV. We are also seeing promising results from the
reorganization of our go-to-market channels in mid-2023 in Brazil, where we continue to see plenty of
potential to grow in the SMB segment.

Online Payments continues to grow at high double-digit rates in Brazil, Mexico and Chile. It has benefited from
a more robust acquisition effort that leverages the more than two decades of experience that we have built
into our product. The growth in the proportion of logged payers - buyers on third party platforms that are able
to pay via their Mercado Pago account - has helped to drive NPS higher across our major geographies. We
continue to see an attractive structural growth opportunity across the region for Online Payments.


  Consolidated Financial Results

Our revenue continued to scale well in Q2'24 and reached $5,073mn, growing 42% YoY. The shipping
reporting updates we outlined in our Q1'24 Shareholder Letter contributed 14ppts ($484mn) to growth. We are
seeing encouraging trends across our geographies with strong revenue growth of 51% YoY in Brazil (15ppts
from shipping reporting updates), 66% YoY in Mexico (22ppts from shipping reporting updates) and 36% YoY
in our Others segment (12ppts from shipping reporting updates). Argentina's FX-neutral growth of 285% YoY
(flat YoY in USD) was similar to inflation, marking a significant improvement vs. Q1'24, primarily on the back of
stronger GMV trends. Both Commerce and Fintech revenue streams are growing well, up 53% YoY (25ppts
from shipping reporting updates) and 28% YoY respectively in USD despite FX headwinds. This underscores
that we are executing well on the growth opportunities we are exploring.

Income from operations of $726mn in Q2’24 was up 9% YoY, and grew 31% YoY ex. Argentina. The margin of
14.3% fell 4.4ppts YoY, with headwinds of: a) 1.5ppts from the dilutive effect of the shipping reporting updates
that we outlined in Q1'24 (which impact our 2024 financials, but not the 2023 comparisons); b) 2.4ppts due to
Argentina's margin contracting and its contribution to revenue diminishing; and c) 2.7ppts from provisions for
doubtful accounts.

Logistics net costs rose by 50bps YoY as a percentage of GMV (equivalent to 130bps of revenue) due to
investment in strategic initiatives such as fulfillment and MELI+, as well as higher short-term costs in Mexico.
That said, net costs as a percentage of GMV improved on a sequential basis helped by productivity gains in
our fulfillment centers in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. We are also managing carrier costs tightly,
and were able to postpone increases from certain suppliers to H2'24.



                                                                                                              4
                                                                                         Q2’24 Results


The increase in provisions for doubtful accounts was due to two factors: 1) the faster pace of growth in credit
originations in Q2'24 (+79% YoY) versus consolidated revenue (+42% YoY); and 2) a higher share of the
portfolio coming from the credit card which, as discussed earlier, has higher provisions relative to revenue
than our other loan products.

We also scaled G&A, Product Development and Sales & Marketing expenses on a reported basis, with 2.8ppts
of operating leverage. This reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency and ability to deliver cost
dilution as the business scales.

At the country level, in Q2'24 we saw higher margins YoY in Brazil (once the impact of shipping reporting
updates is excluded) due to strong cost dilution, and less YoY pressure on margins in Argentina than in Q1'24
due to better GMV trends, less pressure on shipping costs and lower funding costs in Fintech. Margins in
Mexico were pressured primarily by: 1) higher provisioning due to growth of the credit business; and 2) higher
shipping operating costs due to greater seasonal cost headwinds around the Hot Sale event combined with
the pressures of operating with limited spare capacity in our fulfillment network.

Net income rose 103% YoY to $531mn, supported by growth in EBIT and a reduction of FX losses related to
Argentina. Lower FX losses are a partly function of the narrowing of the gap between the official and blue chip
swap exchange rates in Argentina, which is a positive impact of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso (which
negatively impacted income from operations). In Q2'24, our net income margin of 10.5% was the highest in the
last eight years.

Mercado Libre is generating cash even as we continue to invest to seed future growth opportunities. This
quarter we are introducing "adjusted free cash flow" as a new non-GAAP financial measure that we believe will
help investors better understand the cash generation of our operations. A full explanation can be found in the
"Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this document. Adjusted free cash flow was $678mn in Q2'24 (vs.
$145mn in Q2'23) and $838mn year-to-date, even with higher capex ($184mn in Q2'24), and funding of the
credit portfolio. Our strong cash flow generation, coupled with the reduction in our leverage ratios in recent
quarters, led to S&P revising its credit rating outlook on Mercado Libre to "Positive" in June.



  Looking Ahead

Tomorrow, August 2, 2024, marks 25 years since we founded Mercado Libre with the mission of
democratizing commerce and financial services in Latin America. Over those 25 years, we have built a
sustainable company that provides millions of small- and medium-sized businesses with the tools they need to
compete with larger players; we have enabled the shift to online retail by providing tens of millions of
consumers with world-class levels of service; and we have included millions of people into the financial system
across the region for the first time. These are notable achievements, but they are also just a baseline from
which we think about our even bigger ambitions to deliver on our mission at an even greater scale. Yet,
looking ahead we believe we have more opportunities than we ever have had in our history and we are
excited to pursue them with the culture of entrepreneurship, excellence and innovation that has served us so
well for the last 25 years. As we always say: the best is yet to come.

  Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance


 To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and
other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral
measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments as non-
GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measures can be found in the tables below.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by
other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the
most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure
provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the
future.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the
effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense
and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an
unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our
Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation
of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it
provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain
items.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:

Net debt

We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial
liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities
restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have
included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current
leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance
sheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to
investors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its
capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used
measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:

FX neutral

We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by
excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results
and business outlook.

The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during
2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have
been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany
allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local
currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local
currency inflation or devaluations.

The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the
three-month periods ended June 30, 2024:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

Adjusted free cash flow

Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash
equivalents and investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions
and equity securities held at cost, investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in
loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities related to
our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital of the Fintech activities. We
consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to
management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that
can be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the
utility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the
total increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe
it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated
statements of cash flows.

Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments

Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net
proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and
corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not
considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider
Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides
useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and
activities from the adjusted free cash flow.
