    ],
    "recommendation": "Current valuation of $2,064 appears significantly ahead of intrinsic value across all scenarios. Base case ($542) shows 74% downside, bull case ($1,318) shows 36% downside, probability-weighted IV ($583) shows 72% downside. Even the most optimistic sensitivity case (WACC 9%, terminal growth 4.5%) yields only $2,113 IV, barely justifying current price with zero margin of safety.\n\nThe market is pricing in near-perfect execution of best-case scenarios: sustained 30%+ growth, significant margin expansion, flawless credit portfolio performance, and no competitive margin pressure. Entry price analysis suggests waiting for substantial pullback to $850 (bull entry) or ideally $430 (base entry) for adequate risk/reward.\n\nThat said, MELI has demonstrated exceptional execution (27 consecutive quarters 30%+ growth, transition to profitability, $1.3B FCF generation) and the LatAm e-commerce/fintech opportunity is genuinely massive (penetration can double, 100M+ buyer addressable market for fintech cross-sell, credit cards just launching). For high-conviction growth investors willing to pay premium valuations for quality execution and structural tailwinds, the bull case may justify patience at current levels IF all growth drivers materialize. However, risk/reward appears poor with minimal margin of safety.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION: WATCH. Company is exceptional with multiple powerful growth vectors, but current valuation fully prices in optimistic scenarios with no room for disappointment. Seek entry opportunities on market corrections (target $800-1,000 range) or wait for evidence that company can sustain 30%+ growth with margin expansion that validates current market expectations. Existing shareholders may consider trimming positions and redeploying on weakness."
