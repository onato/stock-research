    "Credit business path to profitability clear: Brazil credit card 50% of portfolio now profitable; cohorts maturing as planned; first-payment defaults at record lows; NIMAL of 21-23% solid despite mix shift to cards and upmarket moves; originations up 57% YoY; financial inclusion TAM massive (6 in 10 Argentinians lack cards)",

    "Credit portfolio risk underappreciated: $11.0B portfolio up 83% YoY with rapid growth in unseasoned cohorts; credit card 43% of portfolio still mostly unprofitable; NPL at 6.8% could spike in recession; provisions now 12% of revenue vs historical 6-8%; immature cohorts create visibility concerns on ultimate losses",

    "Free shipping strategy margin headwind sustained: Brazil threshold at R$19 (from R$79) significantly reduced shipping revenue as % of GMV; requires massive volume scale to offset; competitors could force further threshold reductions; shipping costs absorbed (28% QoQ Brazil volume increase) may not fully leverage over time",
