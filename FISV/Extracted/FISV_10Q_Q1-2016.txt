Fiserv, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. Such adjustments consisted of normal recurring items. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain certain information included in the annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Fiserv, Inc. (the “Company”). These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fiserv, Inc. and all 100% owned subsidiaries. Investments in less than 50% owned affiliates in which the Company has significant influence but not control are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards, including the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The standard requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement at settlement or expiration and, accordingly, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be presented as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The recognition of all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement, as well as related changes to the computation of diluted earnings per share, is to be applied prospectively. Entities may elect to apply the change in presentation in the statement of cash flows either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for each lease with a term longer than twelve months. The recognized liability is measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid, and the corresponding asset represents the lessee’s right to use the underlying asset over the lease term and is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments. For income statement purposes, the standard retains the dual model with leases classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements of financial instruments. For public entities, ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain provisions of the standard. Entities must apply the standard, with certain exceptions, using a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and to create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of 

5

Table of Contents

promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This model involves a five-step process for achieving that core principle, along with comprehensive disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year and will permit early adoption as of the original effective date in ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified approach to adopt this new guidance. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Fair Value Measurements
The Company applies fair value accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value represents the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The fair values of cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, settlement assets and obligations, and accounts payable approximate their respective carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity. The estimated fair value of total debt was $4.6 billion at March 31, 2016 and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2015, and was estimated using quoted prices in inactive markets for the Company’s senior notes (level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) or using discounted cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for its term loan (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). 

4. Acquisitions
On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Convenience Pay Services business, which enables providers to accept electronic payments from their consumers through multiple channels, thereby expanding the Company’s biller solution offerings. On March 3, 2016, the Company completed its purchase of certain assets of ACI Worldwide, Inc.’s Community Financial Services business, further enhancing the Company’s suite of digital banking and payments solutions. 
The Company acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. As of March 31, 2016, the preliminary purchase price allocations for these acquisitions resulted in technology and customer intangible assets totaling approximately $75 million, goodwill of approximately $180 million, and other identifiable net assets of approximately $10 million. The goodwill, recognized within the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment, from these transactions is deductible for tax purposes and is primarily attributed to synergies and anticipated revenue and earnings growth associated with the products and services that these businesses provide. The purchase price allocations were based on preliminary valuations and are subject to final adjustment. 
The results of operations for these acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company incurred merger and integration costs during the three months ended March 31, 2016, including a $10 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Company’s decision to replace existing software with an acquired solution. The related impairment charge was recorded in cost of processing and services within Corporate and Other as these charges are excluded from the Company’s measure of the Payments segment’s operating performance. Pro forma information for these acquisitions is not provided because they did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

5. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate
The Company owns a 49% interest in StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), which is accounted for as an equity method investment, and reports its share of StoneRiver’s net income as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, StoneRiver recognized a gain on the sale of a business interest in which the Company’s pre-tax share of this gain was $190 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company also received cash dividends from StoneRiver, funded from the sale transaction, of $140 million which were recorded as reductions in the Company’s investment in StoneRiver. In conjunction with this activity, the Company evaluated its equity method investment in StoneRiver for its ability to recover the remaining carrying amount of such investment. Utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) to arrive at a measure of the investment’s fair value, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $44 million.
The Company's pre-tax share of the gain, net of the impairment loss, of $146 million was recorded within income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate, with the related tax expense of $54 million recorded through the income tax provision,

in the consolidated statements of income. The Company’s investment in StoneRiver was $23 million and $17 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is reported within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on the Company’s investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities.

6. Share-Based Compensation
The Company recognized $22 million and $18 million of share-based compensation expense during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s annual grant of share-based awards generally occurs in the first quarter. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company granted 0.9 million stock options and 0.5 million restricted and performance-based stock units at weighted-average estimated fair values of $31.37 and $97.99, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company granted 1.1 million stock options and 0.3 million restricted stock units at weighted-average estimated fair values of $25.41 and $78.98, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, stock options to purchase 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, were exercised.

7. Shares Used in Computing Net Income Per Share
The computation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share is as follows:
	
							
 
	 
	Three Months EndedMarch 31,
	
(In millions)
	 
	2016
	 
	2015
	
Weighted-average common shares outstanding used for the calculation of net income per share – basic

	238.8
	
	
Common stock equivalents

Weighted-average common shares outstanding used for the calculation of net income per share – diluted
	 
	227.3
	
	 
	243.0
	
	

For the each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, stock options for 0.6 million shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average outstanding shares because their impact was anti-dilutive.

Based on the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at March 31, 2016, the Company estimates that it will recognize approximately $12 million in interest expense during the next twelve months related to settled interest rate hedge contracts.
The Company has entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. As of March 31, 2016, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $74 million, and the fair value was nominal. As of December 31, 2015, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $85 million, and the fair value totaling approximately $1 million is reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
This quarterly report contains “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those that express a plan, belief, expectation, estimation, anticipation, intent, contingency, future development or similar expression, and can generally be identified as forward-looking because they include words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “could,” “should” or words of similar meaning. Statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report involve significant risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. The factors that may affect our results include, among others: pricing and other actions by competitors; the capacity of our technology to keep pace with a rapidly evolving marketplace; the impact of market and economic conditions on the financial services industry; the impact of a security breach or operational failure on our business; the effect of legislative and regulatory actions in the United States and internationally; our ability to comply with government regulations; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, and to realize the anticipated benefits associated with the same; the impact of our strategic initiatives; and other factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should consider these factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows:

		
•
	Overview. This section contains background information on our company and the services and products that we provide, our enterprise priorities and the trends affecting our industry in order to provide context for management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.
	

		
•
	Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to the comparable period in 2015.
	

		
•
	Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt as of March 31, 2016.
	
Overview
Company Background
We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 13,000 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.
Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides debit and credit card processing and services, electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including

share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.
During the first quarter of 2016, we acquired two businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. In January 2016, we acquired Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay Services business, which enables providers to accept electronic payments from their consumers through multiple channels, thereby expanding our biller solution offerings. In March 2016, we completed our purchase of certain assets of ACI Worldwide, Inc.'s Community Financial Services business, further enhancing our suite of digital banking and payments solutions.
During the first quarter of 2016, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest. Our share of the net gain on this transaction was $146 million, with related tax expense of $54 million. In addition, we received cash dividends from StoneRiver, funded from the sale transaction, of $140 million during the first quarter of 2016.
Enterprise Priorities
We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2016 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
Industry Trends
The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. In particular, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”
This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients.
In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that 

11

Table of Contents

consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs.
Results of Operations
The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

Total Revenue
Total revenue increased $56 million, or 4%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by revenue growth of 8% in our Payments segment. 
Revenue in our Payments segment increased $53 million, or 8%, during the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Payments segment revenue growth was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $44 million, or 9%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. This growth was primarily due to new clients, additional product offerings and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services and electronic payments businesses, as well as revenue from acquired businesses of $13 million. In addition, product revenue increased $9 million, or 5%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased volumes in our output solutions business, including a higher level of card manufacturing and personalization.
Revenue in our Financial segment increased $6 million, or 1%, during the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Revenue growth was negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2016 from a decline in higher-margin software license-related revenue as compared to the prior year period.
Total Expenses
Total expenses increased $31 million, or 3%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 90 basis points from 75.4% in the first quarter of 2015 to 74.5% in the first quarter of 2016.
Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 50.8% in the first quarter of 2015. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure.
Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly to 86.6% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 87.0% in the first quarter of 2015. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in the first quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by increased volumes in our output solutions business, partially offset by the negative impact of a decline in higher-margin software license revenue.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 18.7% in the first quarter of 2015, due to the timing of certain employee compensation and benefit expenses in 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in the first quarter of 2016 of 19.4% was consistent with the full year 2015 rate of 19.7% of total revenue.

Operating Income and Operating Margin
Total operating income increased $25 million, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Total operating margin increased 90 basis points to 25.5% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 24.6% in 2015. Operating income and operating margin improvements in 2016 were driven by revenue growth, scale efficiencies, expense discipline and operational effectiveness initiatives.
Operating income in our Payments segment increased $34 million, or 18%, and operating margin increased 250 basis points to 30.0%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2016 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our card services and electronic payments businesses, along with product mix in our output solutions business, which included a higher level of card manufacturing and personalization.
Operating income in our Financial segment decreased $9 million, or 4%, and operating margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.6% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Operating income and operating margin in 2016 were negatively impacted by product mix including a decrease in higher-margin software license-related revenue.
The operating loss in the Corporate and Other segment was $81 million in both the first quarter of 2016 and 2015. The operating loss in the first quarter of 2016 includes acquisition-related integration costs, including a $10 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the decision to replace an existing software solution with software purchased in a business acquisition, offset by lower amortization compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased slightly by $1 million or 2%, in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 as higher average outstanding debt in 2016 was offset by a lower interest rate structure as a result of the debt refinancing activities in the second quarter of 2015.
Interest and Investment (Loss) Income
The interest and investment loss of $7 million in the first quarter of 2016 was attributable to a non-cash write-off of a $7 million cost-method investment.
Income Tax Provision
Income tax provision as a percentage of income before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was 51.0% and 35.1% in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The higher rate in the first quarter of 2016 was due to income tax expense of $54 million associated with our share of the net gain on the sale of a business interest by StoneRiver, partially reduced by the favorable resolution of tax matters.
Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate
Our share of StoneRiver's net income, attributed to the net gain on the sale of a business interest, was $146 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Net Income Per Share – Diluted 
Net income per share-diluted was $1.27 and $0.73 in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income per share-diluted in the first quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by $0.39 per share due to our share of the net gain on the sale of a business interest at StoneRiver, partially offset by the non-cash investment write-off. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets reduced net income per share-diluted by $0.12 and $0.13 in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $283 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2016. The following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was $509 million in the first three months of 2016, an increase of 47% compared with $346 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased operating results, cash dividends received from our StoneRiver joint venture, and favorable working capital changes. Working capital was favorably impacted in 2016 by the timing of accrued expenses, including tax payments associated with our share of the net gain at StoneRiver and corresponding dividends.
Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 5% and 7% of our total revenue in the first three months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2015 include approximately $10 million related to our Atlanta facility consolidation, which is offset by a landlord reimbursement reported in net changes in working capital and other.
During the first three months of 2016, we received cash dividends of $140 million from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we acquired Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay Services business and certain assets of ACI Worldwide, Inc.'s Community Financial Services business for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million during the first three months of 2016. These acquisitions were funded utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.
We purchased $321 million of our common stock during the first three months of 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately 14.0 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.

At March 31, 2016, our debt consisted primarily of $3.3 billion of senior notes, $628 million of term loan borrowings and $538 million of revolving credit facility borrowings. Interest on our senior notes is paid semi-annually. During the first three months of 2016, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants.
Variable Rate Debt
We maintain a term loan and a $2.0 billion amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. Both the term loan and outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate was 1.68% on the term loan borrowings and 1.49% on the amended and restated revolving credit facility borrowings at March 31, 2016. A remaining scheduled principal payment on the term loan of $90 million is due on December 31, 2017, with the outstanding principal balance of $540 million due at maturity in October 2018. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements on the amended and restated revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2020. The term loan and amended and restated revolving credit facility contain various, substantially similar restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.
