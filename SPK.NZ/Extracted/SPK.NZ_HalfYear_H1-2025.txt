year ended 30 June 2024. Certain comparative information has
been updated to conform with the current year’s presentation.
Financial instruments are either carried at amortised cost, less any
provision for impairment, or fair value. The only significant variances
between instruments held at amortised cost and their fair value
relate to long-term debt. There were no changes in valuation
techniques during the period. Spark’s derivatives are held at fair
value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and
observable market rates of interest and foreign exchange prices.
This represents a level two measurement under the fair value
measurement hierarchy, being inputs other than quoted prices
included within level one that are observable for the asset or
liability. The fair value of receivables and prepayments are
approximately equal to their carrying value.
As at 31 December 2024, capital expenditure amounting to
$718 million (30 June 2024: $684 million) had been committed
under contractual arrangements.

Note 3 Segment information
The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how Spark reviews its performance. Spark’s
segments are measured based on product margin, which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs. The segment
results exclude other gains, labour, other operating expenses, finance income and expense, depreciation and amortisation, net investment
income and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall Group level by the Chief Executive.

Comparative segment results
Spark has made minor reclassifications of segment revenues and costs from IT products and IT services to data centres. There is no change
to the overall Spark reported result because of these changes.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 4 Non-GAAP measures
Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information to readers to assist in the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of
Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to establish
operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures
reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the
telecommunications industry.

Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment
income (EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back finance expense, depreciation and amortisation and income tax expense, subtracting finance
income and adjusting for net investment income (which includes Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures,
interest income on loans receivable from associates and joint ventures, net loss on remeasurement of equity accounted investments and
dividend income) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent
with, those presented in these interim financial statements.

Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
expenses and impairments) individually greater than $25 million. In the six months ended 31 December 2024, the transformation costs
associated with Spark’s SPK-26 Operate Programme amounted to $29 million and were deemed significant to adjust.

Note 4 Non-GAAP measures (continued)
Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to
arise on maturity, plus debt due within one year, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge
adjustments and any unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.
A reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt at carrying value is provided below:

Independent Auditor’s Review Report
to The Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Conclusion
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial statements’) of Spark New Zealand Limited
(‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) on pages 3 to 16 which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December
2024, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for
the six months ended on that date, and notes to the interim financial statements, including material accounting policy information.
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements of the Group do not
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024 and its financial performance and cash flows
for the six months ended on that date in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

Basis for Conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements Performed by the Independent Auditor
of the Entity (‘NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)’). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Review of the
Interim Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual
financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to the regulatory audit, other assurance related services
(such as trustee reporting), compliance services and non-assurance services provided to the Corporate Taxpayer Group of which Spark
New Zealand Limited is a member, along with a number of other organisations. These services have not impaired our independence as
auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a sister and brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte
partners are not involved in the provision of any services to the Company and its subsidiaries and this matter has not impacted our
independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading
activities of the business of the Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in the Group.

Directors’ responsibilities for the interim financial statements
The directors are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial statements in
accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the interim financial statements
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review. NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to
conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements, taken as a whole, are
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
A review of the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying
analytical and other review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) and consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion
on the interim financial statements.

Restriction on use
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in a review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company’s shareholders as a body, for our
engagement, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
