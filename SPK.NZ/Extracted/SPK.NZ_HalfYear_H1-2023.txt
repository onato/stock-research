NOTE 3 Sale of Connexa (continued)


Deferred tax assets and income tax credit
Due to the difference between the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognised at the date of
the transaction, a non-cash deferred tax asset of $126 million was recognised, with a corresponding
adjustment to tax income. As noted in the statement of cash flows on page 6, payments for income
tax in H1 FY23 were $120 million (H1 FY22: $93 million).

Assignment of ground leases
As part of the transaction, Spark assigned its ground leases for the mobile sites to be sold to
Connexa. As a result, Spark remeasured these lease liabilities to the next right of renewal as at this
point these leases will be novated to Connexa. This resulted in a $51 million reduction of the lease
liabilities and right-of-use assets which were held for sale. On the sale of Connexa the right-of-use
assets were replaced with finance lease receivables equal to the lease liabilities which were
transferred back from held for sale.

NOTE 5 Non-GAAP measures


Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in
the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These
measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-
based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be
viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with
NZ IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the
telecommunications industry.
Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net
investment income (EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back finance expense, depreciation and amortisation and
income tax expense and subtracting finance income and net investment income (which includes
Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures, interest income on loans
receivable from associates and joint ventures and dividend income) to net earnings. A reconciliation
of Spark’s EBITDAI and adjusted EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and
consistent with, those presented in these interim financial statements.

Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year
includes significant items (such as gains, expenses and impairments) individually greater than
$25 million. In the six months ended 31 December 2022 the net gain on sale of Connexa of
$584 million and the one off provision of $52 million for Spark Sport as described in note 2 were
deemed significant items to adjust. There were no significant items to adjust for the six months
ended 31 December 2021.

NOTE 7 Debt (continued)


There have been no changes in Spark’s short-term financing programmes, long-term financing
programmes or stand-by facilities since 30 June 2022. Excess proceeds from the Connexa
transaction were used to repay all bank funding in the period, see note 3 for further details.
The fair value of long-term debt, including long-term debt due within one year, based on market
observable prices, was $968 million compared to a carrying value of $960 million as at 31 December
2022 (30 June 2022: fair value of $1,359 million compared to a carrying value of $1,347 million).

Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at
the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash. Net
debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge adjustments and any
unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but
is a measure used by management. A reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt at
carrying value is provided below:

1 Net debt at hedged rates is the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity and includes an adjustment to state
  the principal of foreign currency medium term notes at the hedged currency rate.
2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in
  dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

NOTE 9 Dividends


On 22 February 2023, the Board approved the payment of a first half ordinary dividend of 13.5 cents
per share or approximately $253 million. The dividend will be 100% imputed. In addition,
supplementary dividends totalling approximately $26 million will be payable to shareholders who
are not resident in New Zealand. In accordance with the Income Tax Act 2007, Spark will receive a tax
credit from Inland Revenue equivalent to the amount of supplementary dividends paid.
                                                                                                               H1 FY23

1 Spark’s American Depositary Shares, each representing five ordinary Spark shares and evidenced by American Depositary
  Receipts (ADRs), are traded over-the-counter in the United States. This is a Level 1 ADR programme that is sponsored by
  Bank of New York Mellon. For H1 FY23, these are based on the exchange rate at 17 February 2023 of NZ$1 to US$0.6247
  and a ratio of five ordinary shares per one American Depositary Share. The actual exchange rate used for conversion is
  determined in the week prior to payment when the Bank of New York performs the physical currency conversion.
2 Supplementary dividends are paid to non-resident shareholders.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders can elect to receive
dividends in additional shares. For the six months ended 31 December 2022 no shares were issued
(31 December 2021: shares with a total value of $8 million were issued) in lieu of dividends. Shares
issued in lieu of dividends are excluded from dividends paid in the statement of cash flows.
The dividend reinvestment plan has been suspended for the H1 FY23 dividend and for the
foreseeable future.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report
to The Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Conclusion
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial
statements’) of Spark New Zealand Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) which
comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, and, the statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows
for the six months ended on that date, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information on pages 3 to 18.
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim
financial statements of the Group do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and its financial performance and cash flows for the six
months ended on that date in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34
Interim Financial Reporting.

Basis for Conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (‘NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)’). Our responsibilities
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Review of the Interim Financial
Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in
New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to the regulatory
audit, other assurance related services (such as trustee reporting), compliance services and non-
assurance services provided to the Corporate Taxpayer Group. These services have not impaired our
independence as auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a sister and
brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the provision
of any services to the Company and its subsidiaries and this matter has not impacted our
independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with Group on normal terms within the
ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. The firm has no other relationship
with, or interest in the Group.

Directors’ responsibilities for the interim financial statements
The directors are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of
the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34
Interim Financial Reporting and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the interim financial statements
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review.
NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting.
Page 20         Spark New Zealand Interim financial statements




A review of the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited
assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily
of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those
performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) and consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we might identify in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the interim financial statements.

Restriction on use
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our review has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to
state to them in a review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company’s shareholders as a body,
for our engagement, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
