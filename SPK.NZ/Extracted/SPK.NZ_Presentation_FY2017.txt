• Cash conversion ratio(2) improved to 89% in FY17; H2 FY17 saw average cash
   conversion improve to 94% due to cyclical impact of prepayments

   term target of 11% to 12% capex to revenue
• Net debt increased by $117m during FY17 but declined by $16m during H2 FY17
   due to divestment proceeds and improved cash conversion; current 0.96x gearing (3)                                                              Reported EBITDA

Product Economics
Broadband
Higher wholesale access charges for both fibre and copper are putting further pressure
on broadband retail margins in a fiercely competitive market
Mandated increases in wholesale access charges
are taking effect every year up to 2019:
• $1.00 plus GST extra for most fibre inputs each
    July since 2015 (schedule of annual increases
    built into initial UFB contracts with Chorus/LFCs)
• ~$0.30 plus GST extra for Chorus copper inputs
    each December since 2016 (part of ComCom
    FPP determination in Dec 2015)

On top of these increases, the retail market for fibre
plans has also moved to more expensive higher                                                                              $736m

• Fibre 100/20 Mbps input $2.50 - $4.50 more
    expensive than 30/10 (cost varies between
    Chorus/ LFCs)

Higher wholesale access charges are squeezing
retail margins even harder at the lower end of the
market:
• Wholesale charges now account for almost two-
    thirds of the price of a basic broadband plan
    (up from about half of the price of a basic
    broadband plan two years ago)

Changes to Chair and Board
Spark Chairman Mark Verbiest will stand down later this year and be replaced by
current director Justine Smyth

This change is part of a well considered transition and succession plan. With Spark
positioned well for the future and with Mr Verbiest being the director with the longest
association with Spark, now is the optimal time to renew the leadership of the Board.

The Spark Board has appointed current director Justine Smyth as the new Chair,
effective on 3 November 2017. Ms Smyth has extensive governance experience,
including with Spark as the Chair of the Audit and Risk Management Committee and
Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
                                                                                 $736m

Ms Smyth will also succeed Mr Verbiest as Chair of the Nominations $667m
                                                                   and Corporate
Governance Committee. Current director Alison Gerry will succeed Ms Smyth as the
Chair of the Audit and Risk Management Committee, while current director Alison
Barrass will succeed Ms Smyth as the Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation
Committee.

The Board will commence a recruitment process for a new director in due course, and
will take the time to ensure the right person with the right set of skills is found.
