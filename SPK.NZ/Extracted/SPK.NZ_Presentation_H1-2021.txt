 First half operating conditions
 New Zealand’s economy recovering sooner than expected, however the recent Auckland lockdown
  demonstrates uncertainty remains.

 Early indications of lower billing and collection risk – however, Government stimulus may continue to
  mask the full extent of the impact.

 Decline in overall mobile market revenue(1) due to border closures and loss of roaming revenues.

 The broadband and prepaid markets were impacted as border closures resulted in approximately
  44,000 fewer people migrating to New Zealand(2) in H1 FY21 vs. H1 FY20.

 Demand for collaboration tools to enable flexible working and business continuity with flexible cloud-
  based “as a service” offerings increasing, but at a slower rate due to economic uncertainty.

 Accelerated cost reduction programme to mitigate impacts of COVID-19.

 Supporting New Zealand’s recovery by investing in critical 5G infrastructure, digital skills for small
  business, and bridging the digital divide for vulnerable communities.
