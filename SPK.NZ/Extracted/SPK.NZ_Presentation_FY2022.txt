          Defining free cash flow for Spark’s future dividend policy
          The Capital Management Framework introduces a dividend policy to provide investors greater certainty on how the Board will consider dividends over the
          long-run.

          Dividend Policy: pay-out ratio of ~80%-100% of free cash flow on a long run basis, with annual guidance expressed on a cents per share basis.

          Free cash flow has been redefined from FY23 to minimise the impact of short-term working capital volatility and to support incremental growth capital
          expenditure.
