H1 FY24 Results Summary
Market momentum and cost control underpinning adjusted revenue and EBITDAI growth in challenging environment
 Top-line growth(1) in challenging economic environment
 • Delivered adjusted revenue growth of 1.3% to $1,976 million, reflecting strength of market positions
 • In telco, mobile remains central to growth, with service revenue up 6.3%, while broadband revenue and share remained broadly stable
 • In digital services, cloud is back in growth, while total IT revenues were flat and digital health revenues down, primarily due to lower public sector demand
 • Data centres revenue up as Takanini expansion came online, and high-tech growth driven by strong IoT performance
 • Cost discipline held operating expenses broadly flat, supporting adjusted EBITDAI growth of 3.9% to $530 million
 • Adjusted NPAT decreased 4.8% to $157 million due to higher average interest rates on debt and higher interest payments on Connexa leases, with second half
   improvement expected in line with stronger H2 EBITDAI(2)
 • Larger share of capital investment in H1 to gain a fast start on strategy and implement upgrade programmes resulting in lower free cash flow. Remain
   committed to FY24 capex guidance and FCF aspiration of ~$490-$530 million
 SPK-26 strategy on track, with growth investments progressing to plan
