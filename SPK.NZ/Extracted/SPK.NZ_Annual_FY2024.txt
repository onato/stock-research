Accelerating
Aotearoa through
technology
Aotearoa New Zealand faces many interconnected
challenges. The economic environment is tough,
our productivity challenge is persistent, and
climate change mitigation and adaptation is more
urgent than ever before.
The good news is that the pace of technological
advancement is accelerating just as quickly as
these challenges.
Advanced digital technologies, such as generative AI, are
changing the way people connect, communicate, and do
business and have the potential to accelerate efficiency,
productivity, and sustainability by enabling people and
businesses to do things differently.
To bring these opportunities to our shores New Zealand will
need investment in the digital infrastructure that underpins
all forms of technology and connects us to the world, in
innovation to unlock and scale new use cases, and in skilled
people who can make it all a reality. And this is where Spark
comes in.
As New Zealand’s largest telecommunications and digital
services provider, our ambition is to empower the people
and businesses creating Aotearoa’s tomorrow.
During FY24 we have continued to progress our three-year
strategy, SPK-26, to achieve this goal. We are investing in
the digital infrastructure that will underpin Aotearoa’s digital
economy and create long-term, sustainable growth for our
shareholders.
We have continued to improve customer experiences by
making it easier to interact with Spark, we are backing our
business customers to leverage technology to its fullest
potential, and we are investing in the skills and
development of the people who make it all possible – our
Spark whānau.
It has been a tough year for all New Zealand businesses,
and Spark is not immune to these challenges. But we remain
optimistic about our country’s potential, the ingenuity of
New Zealanders, and the role technology will play in
enabling great people and businesses to do great things.

About this report

•   This is an integrated report that shares our financial, social,
    environmental, and economic performance. To inform our
    approach we have applied the International <IR> Framework,
    which considers the creation of value over the short, medium,
    and long term, thinking holistically about the resources and                                                                               Key dates
    relationships our organisation uses or affects and the
    dependencies and trade-offs between them as value is created.                                                                             Annual Meeting
•   At the heart of this approach is the <IR> value creation model                                                                           01 November 2024

    standards, the most widely used global sustainability reporting
    standard. This requires us to apply a materiality lens to identify
    and report against the sustainability issues most important to
    our business and our stakeholders. We have a dedicated
    sustainability appendix at the back of the report that includes
    our materiality matrix and GRI index, to direct readers to where
    we have covered specific sustainability topics in the report and
    elsewhere. See pages 163–174.

How we create value




How we create value
As part of Integrated Reporting, we use this diagram to show how we create value as a business. It starts with the forms of capital we
rely on – from traditional forms of capital, such as financial capital, to broader forms of capital, such as manufactured or human capital.
It then displays the outputs we have delivered as a result in FY24, alongside the longer-term outcomes we are trying to achieve.

     offset by a similar reduction in payments to suppliers.
•    Investing cash outflows of $550 million in FY24 were mainly
     due to payments for the purchase of property, plant and
     equipment and intangibles. While in FY23, this was an inflow
     of $425 million, mainly due to the receipt of net proceeds
     from the sale of the Connexa business of $893 million,
     partially offset by payments for the purchase of property,
     plant and equipment and intangibles of $475 million.
•    Financing cash outflows were $255 million in FY24
     compared with an outflow of $1,196 million in FY23.
     The prior year included repayments of debt of $463 million
     following the sale of Connexa. In FY24 debt levels increased
     as funds were invested in capital projects in line with Spark’s
     strategy and the on-market share buy-back concluded.
•    Free cash flow of $330 million was $159 million lower in
     FY24, driven by the decline in EBITDAI, increased cash
     payments for capital expenditure included in free cash flow1,
     and increased interest payments.

Cash payments for capital expenditure items (including capitalised
interest and excluding spectrum payments) in the statement of
cash flows were $592 million compared with capital expenditure
of $518 million. The main drivers of this difference are related to
network expenditure items that were received in FY23 but not
paid for until FY24, together with payments of capex at the end of

Our Board and Leadership Squad




Strategic role of the Board
Spark’s Board plays a critical role in helping
to guide and test company strategy, by
engaging in an ongoing conversation with
the Leadership Squad around key strategic
decisions. These decisions are in relation to
the long-term strategic planning and
direction of the business and our ability to
create value in the medium and long term.
It also includes non-financial performance
in areas such as customer experience,
governance, and sustainability. The Board
approves and monitors SPK-26 (our
business strategy) and has oversight of
cyber security and maturity, modern
slavery, and climate change risk. For a
detailed explanation of the Board’s
oversight of climate risk and opportunities
see page 91.
As the body elected by shareholders to
protect and enhance the value of Spark’s
assets, the Board has oversight of Spark’s
financials and the annual and three-year
planning processes. Board members
engage in robust discussions with
management around the strategic direction
of the business to test and ensure
investment is going towards the things
that will deliver the best outcomes for the
company and shareholders. This flows
through to Spark’s remuneration policies,
where there is Board involvement in setting
targets and hurdles for short-term and
long-term incentives.

 Creating value for our customers




 Bringing New Zealanders the best
 digital-first experiences
 In the last year we have continued to focus
 on digital-first care experiences for our
 customers, to better anticipate customer
 needs, reduce wait times, and improve the
 overall experience of interacting with Spark.
 Our retail and virtual care agents form our
 United Frontline (UFL) and support our
 customers across a variety of channels
 – including call centres, stores, and through
 digital messaging. Enabling our team to
 flow across channels ensures our customers
 receive timely responses and an experience
 that consistently ’feels like Spark’. This year
 we saw use of our messaging tool, which is
 available via the MySpark App or a
 customer’s preferred messaging app,
 surpass voice calling as the preferred
 customer contact method for the first time.
 Our UFL teams are now utilising the same
 online journey as our customers, rather
 than navigating more complex, separate
 systems. This means Spark agents can see
 exactly what our customers can see when
 providing support, which is enabling faster
 and more effective resolution.                    unlimited calls, texts, and mobile data if     Introducing Hello Tomorrow

Accelerating Aotearoa businesses
one technology generation
forward
In February, Spark and the New Zealand
Institute of Economic Research (NZIER)
launched a new report titled ‘Accelerating
Aotearoa businesses one technology
generation forward’ – examining the state
of New Zealand's productivity challenge,
and the role advanced digital technologies
can play in solving it.
The study combined insights from global
research into small advanced economies,
economic modelling by NZIER, and Spark’s
knowledge of current and future
opportunities enabled by digital
technology. It revealed that a 20% uplift
in the use of advanced digital technologies
is predicted to increase industry output
by up to $26 billion over the next decade
and GDP by as much as 2.08% per year.

Unlocking the power of 5G
Our national 5G rollout has continued at
pace, with 5G now live in 103 locations
across Aotearoa, from large cities to smaller
regional towns. This means almost half the
population can now access 5G through
Spark’s network.
As we build our 5G network across the
country, we are also working on making it
more advanced and powerful. 5G is not just
about faster internet on your phone, it can
also improve the performance and
reliability of many services and applications,
such as video streaming, gaming, and smart
solutions. We are currently deploying a 5G
core network, which will deliver a true
end-to-end 5G experience, without any
dependency on legacy technologies –
known as 5G standalone.
5G standalone allows us to create different
service slices of the network that can be
tailored for different purposes, referred to
as network slicing. This means we can
optimise the network to suit the specific
needs of different customers and industries.
We are already testing this technology
across a range of different use cases with
customers. For example, we have recently
started a trial that brings together a 5G

The Internet of Things (IoT)
Spark IoT connections have continued to
grow, surpassing two million during FY24.
IoT solutions enable businesses to monitor
things in the natural and physical worlds
around them, collecting data that can then
be analysed and used to inform decision-
making. We deliver these solutions through
a range of different Spark IoT networks,
each catering to different business use
cases depending on bandwidth and
coverage requirements. Specialist IoT
devices are used to record and capture the
data customers want to monitor, and IoT
platforms with dashboard and alert features
can be used by our customers to act
immediately on the insights gathered.

 Up until now our high-tech capabilities –
 such as 5G standalone, AI, and IoT – have
 operated largely independently of each
 other, but globally we are seeing a rapid
 acceleration of technology convergence.
 Converged solutions bring these different
 technologies together to solve business
 problems where it was not possible or
 cost-effective to do so in the past.
 Considering the challenges New Zealand
 businesses are currently facing, we
 believe technology convergence has an
 important role to play in boosting
 productivity and sustainability outcomes
 across our economy.
 During FY24 we have embarked on a
 number of converged technology
 customer trials, to inform our development
 of key use cases that can be scaled further
 in future years.

power outages
One of the main reasons for
telecommunications outages is a loss of
power. Most of our mobile sites are
equipped with battery backup and the
ability to connect standalone generators
when those battery reserves are exhausted,
which provides short-term continuity of
coverage during power outages. We are
now working with our partners to extend
battery life on major, critical sites to ensure
they can withstand power outages for
longer periods of time.
We are also working on an automation
solution for our cell towers to improve the
management of power consumption
during power outages. This means that our
cell towers will be able to monitor their
own power consumption, detect when they
are unable to draw power from the grid,
and automatically prioritise connectivity for
essential communications functions, such
as calls and texts.

Migrating customers off
legacy technology onto
future-proof alternatives
We continue to migrate customers off
end-of-life technology and onto modern
alternatives already used by the majority of
New Zealanders across the country, such as
fibre and wireless. This includes the
retirement of the Public Switched Telephone
Network (PSTN) and our 3G network.

Retiring the Public Switched
Telephone Network (PSTN)
The Spark-operated PSTN – the traditional
way of providing landline services – was
built in the 1980s and is rapidly reaching
end-of-life. The network’s components
have not been manufactured since 2003
and the people with the skills needed to
maintain it are getting harder to find.
The majority of New Zealanders have
already made the switch to fibre or wireless
proactively. In 2017, we had over a million
customer lines on the PSTN, by the end of
FY24 only 77,000 remained. Around 3,200
customer lines, on average, migrate off this
technology every month. As customers
move off the PSTN, we are able to
decommission legacy PSTN equipment. To

            OUTCOMES

         Protecting the
         environment and
         enabling positive
         environmental outcomes
         through our customers’
         use of technology


We rely upon natural capital through the diverse
materials drawn from around the world to
manufacture the physical assets that make up our
networks and technology, and the devices our
customers use. We also draw upon natural
resources to power our technology and our
broader business operations.
Our networks, distributed across New Zealand,
are also impacted by changes in the
environment, which has implications for the
resilience of our infrastructure and the
supporting services required to operate them.
Through the products and services we provide,
our customers are able to live and work more
sustainably and productively, enabling them to
reduce their impact on the environment and use
of natural resources.
We can reduce our draw on natural capital and
shift towards circular and renewable operating
models. And by being deliberate about our role
in enabling emissions reductions and climate
adaptation, we can ensure our customers and all
of New Zealand can realise the benefits of digital
technology in protecting natural capital and
responding to environmental challenges.

suppliers with SBTi-aligned targets in place
has increased to around 43%, up from 33%
last year. A number of our largest suppliers
by spend are our peers in the New Zealand
telecommunications sector. One of our key
local suppliers achieved SBTi verification of
their science-based target in the past year,
a second is finalising an SBTi-verified
target, and a third has committed to set a
target in the next two years. Across our
global supply chain approximately 21% of
our spend is with suppliers that have
publicly committed to setting targets within
the next two years.
As we have strengthened our ethical
supply chain processes we have
implemented a process to survey key
suppliers on an annual basis. This provides
an opportunity to gather more data on
supplier environmental governance,
compliance, and commitments, including
emissions reduction targets and alignment
and validation against SBTi methodology.
For global suppliers our membership of
the global industry group, the Joint Audit
Cooperation (JAC) initiative, provides a
platform to engage suppliers alongside
other telecommunications companies with
similar SBTi-verified supplier engagement
targets. For more information on our
approach to engaging suppliers on
sustainability and ESG matters, refer to our

At Spark our commitment to digital equity
starts with our purpose – to help all of
New Zealand win big in a digital world.
Digital equity starts with having access to
devices and a connection to the internet
but it doesn’t stop there. To close the digital
divide our communities need the skills to
use technology, trust in the digital world,
and the motivation to participate.

Spark’s investment into the

In FY24 we committed nearly $10 million in

internal resources, to achieve our digital

Creating value for our people




Diversity, equity, and
inclusion
Our commitment to diversity, equity, and
inclusion is embedded into our day-to-day
activities, standards, and business practices.
It is a strategic business priority and key
enabler of our performance and culture.
Our focus on diversity, equity, and
inclusion, including our Blue Heart
kaupapa, has helped us create an
environment where our people feel
comfortable bringing their whole selves to
work, regardless of gender, ethnicity,
orientation, age, experience,
neurodivergence, or ability.

Spark’s Blue Heart kaupapa
in action
Our Blue Heart kaupapa sets the standards
of behaviour, alongside our values, to foster
a culture of connection and belonging. It is
a visible icon of our heart-led approach to
diversity and inclusion.
Blue Heart cultural celebrations and events
remain an important part of bringing our
people together and in FY24 we
celebrated key moments, such as
International Women’s Day, Lunar New
Year, Diwali, and Matariki events at our
offices throughout the country.
During FY24, we also held our very first
‘bring your Tamariki to work day’ at Spark
City in Auckland, where our people were
invited to bring their children to work to
experience a range of fun activities and
digital experiences.

Remuneration report

                       A note from Alison Barrass, Chair of the HRCC
                       Tēnā koutou,
                       As the Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC), I am pleased to
                       present Spark’s Remuneration Report for FY24.
                       This year we have consolidated relevant annual report information into a single remuneration
                       report, which outlines our commitment to transparent and equitable remuneration practices
                       that align with our strategic objectives and foster a high-performance culture.
                       Throughout the year, the HRCC has reviewed and refined our remuneration framework and
                       practices to ensure they remain competitive and fair, supporting the attraction, retention,
                       and motivation of our talented workforce. Our approach is underpinned by robust
                       governance and benchmarking against industry standards, ensuring that our policies
                       reflect both market conditions and the long-term interests of our shareholders.
                       At Spark, we seek to remunerate our people with competitive salaries, so we can recruit
Alison Barrass         and retain the best talent. In keeping with our focus on customer experience, we incorporate
Chair of the HRCC      customer satisfaction measures alongside EBITDAI and key strategic initiatives into our
                       short- term incentive (STI) measures each year.
                       Key highlights of our remuneration activities this year include:
                       •   A focus on fair pay: as part of our FY24 Salary Review we ensured that we delivered
                           higher than inflation adjustments to our lowest paid employees taking into consideration
                           benchmarks such as the voluntary Living Wage standard, and that individuals earning less
                           than $100,000 were a focus at this time, due to inflationary pressures in the market.
                       •   A rejuvenated Spark Share approach: we endorsed a new partnership with Sharesies

                                              were granted options under the Spark Long-Term Incentive Scheme (LTI). Under the scheme,
                                              participants were granted options at the start of the three-year vesting period. The number of

1. The table includes base salaries, short-term incentives and vested long-term incentives. The table does not include: amounts paid after 30 June 2024 relating to FY24;
   long-term incentives that have been granted and have yet to vest (based on grant values, the total value of which was NZ$12.8 million as at 30 June 2024); product and
   service concessions received by employees; contributions paid towards health and other insurances; and contributions paid to the Government Superannuation Fund
   (a legacy benefit provided to a small number of employees). As a result of organisational changes in FY24 a significant number of employees with base salaries under
   $100,000 appear in this table due to redundancy payments.

1. Base salary excludes employer contributions towards KiwiSaver and is not at risk.
2. The gross amount earned in FY23 and paid in FY24 was $501,692.
3. FY24 long-term incentive was granted in 2023 and, subject to performance hurdles, will vest in September 2026.

The CEO’s FY21 long-term grant, issued in 2020, did not vest in FY24 (2023) as the Absolute TSR hurdle was not achieved:

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary but ideally would increase
this shareholding to 100% of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any long-term incentive schemes. To fulfil this expectation,
shares are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019. As at 30 June 2024 the CEO holds 311,830 ordinary shares which exceeds
the ideal shareholding requirement to hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 100% of the CEO’s base salary.

Board remuneration
Director remuneration
The remuneration of directors is reviewed annually by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC), taking account of the
company’s size and complexity and the responsibilities, skills, performance, and experience of the directors, with recommendations made to
the Board for approval. Specialist independent consultants may be engaged from time to time to provide advice and ensure that the
remuneration of Spark’s directors is appropriate and comparable to that of similar companies in New Zealand and Australia.
Apart from the CEO, no Director of Spark receives compensation in the form of share options or restricted shares, nor do they participate in any
bonus or profit-sharing plan. Non-executive directors are, however, expected to maintain a holding of Spark shares as set out on page 160 of
this report. As is the case for employees, directors are required to comply with the Insider Trading Policy when buying or selling Spark shares
and any such transactions are disclosed to the market.
Remuneration components
No superannuation or retirement allowance was paid to any Spark Director during FY24. Spark does not have service contracts with any
Director, apart from the CEO, that provide for any benefits or remuneration in the event that a Director’s service with Spark is terminated. New
Zealand-based non-executive directors are eligible for Spark-funded medical insurance, and all non-executive directors are also eligible for
Spark-funded life insurance.
FY24 Director remuneration
The total remuneration available to non-executive directors is fixed by shareholders. The current annual remuneration limit is $1,630,000
approved at the annual meeting held in November 2017.

Climate-related risks and opportunities
The tables below outline the climate-related risks and opportunities that Spark has identified over the short, medium and long-term, together
with the anticipated impacts of those climate-related risks and opportunities. As many of the risks and opportunities identified are present
across all time horizons, we have explained the trend that these risks and opportunities follow across time horizons, identifying the horizon in
which the risk or opportunity is most significant.

Climate metrics and targets
Climate-related metrics
The table below sets out our key climate-related metrics for FY24, by reference to the relevant paragraph of NZ CS 1. Outside of the metrics
below, Spark does not use any industry-based metrics or key performance indicators to measure and manage climate-related risks and
opportunities. We have included information relating to the methods, assumptions and uncertainties associated with the below metrics within
the table, with further detail of the methods, assumptions and uncertainties relating to our GHG emissions outlined in our GHG Inventory
Report. Deloitte provides limited assurance of the emissions included in the report, which is available here: https://investors.sparknz.co.nz/

Section 2 Financial performance
information
2.1 Segment information
The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how Spark reviews its performance.
Spark's segments are measured based on product margin, which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs. The
segment results exclude other gains, labour, other operating expenses, finance income and expense, depreciation and amortisation, net                    2
investment income and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall Group level by the Chief Executive.

Comparative segment results
Spark has reclassified the comparative segment results to:
• Redistribute certain revenues between two new categories IT products (previously cloud, collaboration, managed data and networks)
  and IT services (previously service management and security)
• Move Qrious, Internet of Things, and MATTR from other products into a new high-tech category
• Split data centres out from cloud, and split co-location out from other products to create a combined data centres category.
There is no change to the overall Spark reported result because of these changes.

                                                                            2024                                        2023

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.2 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

Contracts with customers
Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling prices
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price
and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over
time is recognised using the 'resources consumed by customers' method or the 'time-elapsed' method, as these best depict the transfer
of goods or services to customers.
Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service
management contracts. Contracts with a significant financing component include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-
free payment terms of greater than 12 months.
The nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS                                                 TIMING OF SATISFACTION
FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS                                           OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND PAYMENT
Mobile services, broadband services, media services, cloud,             As the service is provided (usually monthly). Generally billed and
security and service management services, managed data services         paid on a monthly basis.

Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods                  When control is passed to the customer, generally when the
                                                                        customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in packages
                                                                        or on interest-free terms, customers usually pay in equal instalments
                                                                        over 6 to 36 months.

                                                                        milestones are completed or once control of goods passes to
                                                                        the customer.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the transaction price
     Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
     entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
     is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.
     We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within
     that product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value
     of money. The 'expected value' or 'most likely' amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount
     where it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction
     price. In making this determination consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as
     well as factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience with
     similar types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations,
     as well as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions,
     incentives, penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.
     Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
     Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
     performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative
     stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the
     observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar
     customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into account
     reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of customer. In
     determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum
     enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as
     revenue as they are earned.
     Distinct goods and services
     We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
     individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
     items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products
     and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.
     Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
     We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the
     methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Refer to page 114 for Spark's
     accounting policy on timing of satisfaction of performance obligations.

1 Interest was capitalised on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets under development for the year ended 30 June 2024 at an annualised rate of 5.7% (30
  June 2023: 4.3%).
2 Included within share of associates' and joint ventures' net losses in the 2023 comparative is $4 million of transaction costs incurred by Connexa in relation to the
  2degrees transaction which diluted Spark's investment in the Connexa group. Therefore, this and the net gain on remeasurement of equity accounted investments
  represent the net gain on dilution of the investment in the Connexa group which is excluded from the comparative adjusted result in note 2.5.

2.5 Non–GAAP measures
Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information to readers to assist in the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of
Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to
establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for
measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the
telecommunications industry.

Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment income
(EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back finance expense, depreciation and amortisation and income tax expense, subtracting finance
                                                                                                                                                                              2
income and adjusting for net investment income (which includes Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures,
interest income on loans receivable from associates and joint ventures, net gain on remeasurement of equity accounted investments and
dividend income) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent
with, those presented in these financial statements.

Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
expenses and impairments) individually greater than $25 million. In the year ended 30 June 2024, the tax effects resulting from the
zero-rating of tax depreciation on buildings effective for Spark from 1 July 2024 of $26 million was deemed a significant item to adjust.
In the year ended 30 June 2023, the net gain on sale of Connexa of $583 million together with the subsequent $5 million net gain arising
from the dilution of the investment in the Connexa group and the one off provision of $54 million for Spark Sport were deemed significant
items to adjust.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
receivables is estimated to be $72 million (30 June 2023: $75 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value.

Contract assets
Contract assets primarily relate to Spark's rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting
date. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Contract costs
Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be recovered and are therefore
initially deferred to the statement of financial position and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is
consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises changes in those
balances:

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract that meet the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires significant
     judgement. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise the costs
     within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer tenure for
     consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
loss provision for short-term: trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and loans
receivable. The calculation of the allowance provision incorporates Spark's previous collection history and forward-looking information,
such as forecasted economic conditions.
The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                                  CURRENT      ≤ 1 MONTH         > 1 MONTH             TOTAL

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be
subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
    rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
    impairment calculation based on Spark's past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates
    at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
    unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product in New Zealand.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Finance lease receivables
Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in
Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore
shown as a net finance lease receivable or net lease liability on the statement of financial position.

In FY23, Spark assigned its ground leases for the mobile site assets sold to Connexa, which resulted in Spark recording finance lease
receivables equal to the lease liabilities for these leases. Spark is unwinding these balances over the remaining term to the next right of
renewal, at which point these will be novated.

In addition, Spark subleases a number of office building floors. Where subleases are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable term
of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.

The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

The lease with Chorus, where Spark is the lessor, has multiple rights of renewals and the full lease term has been used in the majority of
the calculation of the financial lease receivable at lease inception, as it was likely that because of the specialised nature of the buildings,
the lease would be renewed to the maximum term.

Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited Inc and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited (together
‘Southern Cross’) as their carrying values were reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross deficits or repay dividends.
For the year ended 30 June 2024, Spark's share of Southern Cross profits was not recognised because of the existence of historic
cumulative Southern Cross deficits. In the current year Southern Cross profit was $46 million (30 June 2023: $34 million).

1 Remeasurements to property in FY24 and FY23 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases. The reduction in property right-of-use assets for
  corporate property leases is substantially offset by a reduction in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).
2 Relates to right-of-use assets that were held for sale as at 30 June 2022 but not sold as part of the Connexa transaction and therefore transferred back to right-of-use
  assets.

All capacity additions for the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 were fully paid on control being obtained and therefore
deemed capital expenditure as defined and reconciled in note 2.5.
Income from subleasing right-of-use assets for the year ended 30 June 2024 was $2 million (30 June 2023: $2 million).

3.4 Right–of–use assets (continued)

    Key estimates and assumptions
    At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the
    contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess
    whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
    • The contract involves the use of an identified asset
    • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use
    • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset
    At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
    to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
    commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
    adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
    estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is
    located, less any lease incentives received.
    The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
    the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are
    determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for                         3
    impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.



3.5 Leased customer equipment assets
Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of lease arrangements for customer premises equipment. Such
arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a genuine sale if control
of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that a sale does not occur, as
control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor. Spark also acts as a lessor, where there is no
intermediate party, for customer premises equipment.
Spark as the seller-lessee or lessor (when the lease is an operating lease) continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset,
which is initially measured at cost. The asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term.
Movements in leased customer equipment assets are summarised below:

128 Hello tomorrow
                                                                                                              Spark New Zealand Annual Report FY24




3.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Joint arrangement
Spark has a joint arrangement relating to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic submarine cable
between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2024, the carrying value of Spark's share of property, plant and equipment, intangible
assets and capacity right-of-use assets in the joint operation was $31 million (30 June 2023: $30 million).



   Key estimates and assumptions
   Spark's property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets'
   estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires Management
   judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
   obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
   The estimated useful lives of Spark's property, plant and equipment are as follows:
   Telecommunications equipment
   Links and cables                    9 - 50 years
   Network transport                   2 - 15 years
   Mobile radio access network         5 - 25 years
                                                                                                                                                     3
   Customer premises equipment         3 - 5 years
   International cable and satellite   10 - 15 years
   Buildings
   Buildings                           15 - 53 years
   Furniture and fittings              3 - 20 years
   Air conditioning                    5 - 20 years
   Power systems                       3 - 25 years
   Batteries                           5 - 15 years
   Other
   Motor vehicles                      6 years
   Computer equipment                  2 - 8 years
   Internal IT system assets           3 - 15 years
   The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
   conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
   flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
   include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
   for valuing future cash flows.




                                                                                                               Ko te pae anamata, whakamaua 129

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment
     annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires Management judgement, including assessing the
     expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark
     ceasing to use it.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark’s intangible assets are as follows:
     Spectrum licences                                         2 – 21 years
     Software                                                  2 – 16 years
     Customer contracts and brands                             5 – 10 years
     Other intangible assets                                   2 – 100 years

1 Spark changed its cash-generating units from 1 July 2023 in line with the changes in Spark's segment reporting as outlined in note 2.1, the 2023 comparative has been
  restated to align with the updated CGUs.

On 19 October 2023, Spark increased its holding in its investment in associate, Adroit Holdings Limited, an environmental IoT solutions                                      3
company, from 47% to 100% making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Goodwill recognised from the acquisition of $6 million has been
allocated to the High-tech CGU as this is the CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the transaction.
In addition, on 31 January 2024, Spark's subsidiary, Digital Island purchased 100% of the ordinary share capital of Circle Investments
Limited, goodwill of $4 million was recognised on acquisition and has been allocated to the Digital Island CGU.
During the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of the carrying value of
goodwill. Headroom currently exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment using a value-in-use model, which estimates the future cash flows, based on the
    FY25 Board-approved business plan, applied to the next three years, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital
    expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU
    performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include
    revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future
    technology paths.
    Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 11.3% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2024
    (30 June 2023: 11.7%).

Net tangible assets per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not defined in NZ IFRS. Total assets include assets held for sale and
right-of-use assets. Total liabilities include lease liabilities. Net tangible assets per share declined by $0.20 per share from 30 June 2023 as
the prior year calculation was high due to lower debt levels following the sale of the Connexa business. The FY24 calculation was more
aligned to the FY22 net tangible assets per share calculation of $0.34.

1 Remeasurements in FY24 and FY23 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases and mobile sites. For corporate properties, the reduction in lease
  liabilities is substantially offset by a reduction in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4). For mobile site remeasurements there is not a corresponding adjustment in
  right-of-use assets as the majority of these adjustments relate to Connexa leases which have a smaller right-of-use asset due to the sale and leaseback transaction.
2 Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark's
  option, including leases committed to that have not yet commenced.
3 Relates to lease liabilities that were held for sale as at 30 June 2022, but either assigned or, not sold as part of the Connexa transaction and therefore transferred back
  to lease liabilities.

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
     the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
     rate cannot be readily determined, Spark's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as
     the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
     Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
     • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments
     • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement
       date
     • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee
     • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise
     • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option
     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
     future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark's estimate of the amount expected
     to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or
     extension option.
     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
     asset or it is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
     Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of
     12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within
     operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

4.3 Debt
Debt is initially recognised at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and
measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes
attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Liabilities and equity


4.3 Debt (continued)
None of Spark's debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark's debt,
however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default
over Spark's debt in the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023.
The fair value of total debt based on market observable prices was $1,635 million compared to a carrying value of $1,619 million as at
30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: fair value of $1,063 million compared to a carrying value of $1,052 million).

4.4 Capital risk management
Spark manages its capital considering shareholders' interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board is
committed to the Company maintaining an investment grade rating and its capital management policies are designed to ensure this
objective is met. As part of this commitment, and in line with credit rating metrics, Spark currently manages its debt levels to ensure that
the ratio of adjusted net debt at hedged rates (being inclusive of associated derivatives and leases) to adjusted EBITDAI does not exceed
1.7 times on a long-run basis. At 30 June 2024, Spark's net debt to EBITDAI (including lease liabilities) ratio was 2.1x, temporarily
exceeding the 1.7x metric. Management remains committed to ensuring net debt to EBITDAI does not exceed 1.7x on a long-run basis.
As at 30 June 2024, the Company’s S&P Global credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was, respectively, A- and A-2 with outlook
stable (30 June 2023: same).

1 Net debt at hedged rates is the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity and includes an adjustment to state the principal of foreign currency medium term
  notes at the hedged currency rate.
2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have
  no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and foreign
exchange prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other than quoted
prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 no derivative financial
assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting of any derivative
financial instruments is $11 million (30 June 2023: $13 million), which if applied would result in a reduction of derivative assets and
derivative liabilities.

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
Derivatives are designated as:
• Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt
• Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions
• Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in
  cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective                                    5
cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark's own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate
debt and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency floating-rate (variable) debt into
fixed-rate debt.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

Closing balance as at 30 June                                                                                                  12                11

Included within the closing balance at 30 June 2024 is $4 million relating to the cost of hedging reserve (30 June 2023: $4 million).
The movement in the hedge reserves includes $1 million for forward foreign exchange contracts (30 June 2023: $8 million in the change
in fair value of interest rate swaps less $2 million associated deferred tax and $3 million for forward foreign exchange contracts ).

Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
year ended 30 June 2024, there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2023: no material
ineffectiveness) and as a result, no material changes have been recognised in profit and loss.

Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark's risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are
excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
Spark's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
of the debt.
The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRSs are recognised in
other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to
profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

As at 30 June 2024, a movement of 10% in the New Zealand dollar

statement of changes in equity by less than $13 million (30 June

the New Zealand dollar across all currencies and only includes the
effect of foreign exchange movements on monetary financial
instruments.

party that has a strong financial position with no past due amounts.
Spark manages its exposure using a credit policy that includes
limits on exposures with significant counterparties that have been
set and approved by the Board and are monitored on a regular
basis. Spark places its cash and derivative financial instruments
with high-credit quality financial institutions and does not have
significant concentration of risk with any single financial institution.
Spark has significant shareholder loans and finance lease
receivables which are deemed low credit risk. Concentration of
credit risk for trade and other receivables is limited because of
Spark’s large customer base.
Spark has certain derivatives and debt arrangements that are
subject to bilateral credit support agreements that require Spark or
its counterparties to post collateral funds to support the value of
certain derivatives subject to certain agreed threshold amounts. As
at 30 June 2024, no collateral was posted (30 June 2023: nil).
Letters of credit and guarantees may be held over some receivable
amounts. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the
maximum credit exposure.

1 The comparative includes $26 million for the costs associated with assets disposed of in the sale of Connexa, $2 million for the unwind of the deferred tax asset
  explained below for the Connexa transaction and $2 million of current tax for the Spark Sport provision.
2 Due to the difference between the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognised at the date of the sale of Connexa in the prior year, a deferred tax asset of $126
  million was recognised in FY23, with a corresponding adjustment (reduction) to tax expense. The balance of the deferred tax asset at 30 June 2023 was $124 million.
  The Spark Sport provision had a deferred tax impact at 30 June 2023 of $12 million. The current tax impact of adjusting items of $31 million together with the deferred
  income tax impact of $137 million is $168 million (see note 2.5). The total tax expense on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis for FY23 was $185 million.

6.1 Income tax (continued)
Tax depreciation on buildings
As announced as part of their election campaign, the Government enacted legislation to remove the tax depreciation on commercial and
industrial buildings, effective from income tax years on or after 1 April 2024. This reduces the tax base of the building assets back to nil
because depreciation can no longer be claimed on these assets from FY25 onwards. As deferred tax is calculated on the difference
between the carrying amount of the asset and its tax base, the decrease of the tax base has reduced Spark’s deferred tax asset by
$26 million. This also results in a one-off increase in tax expense of $26 million.

Pillar Two legislation
The OECD model GloBE rules, first released by the OECD in December 2021, are intended to ensure that large multinational enterprises
(MNE) with annual revenue of €750m or more pay a minimum level of tax (based on an effective tax rate of 15%) on income arising in each
country where they operate.
Spark is an ‘in-scope‘ MNE under the GloBE rules due to its scale in New Zealand (where its Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) is located)
combined with its small international footprint of constituent entities (CE).
The rules are complex with different adoption and implementation dates applying in different countries meaning the transformation of the
international tax environment will continue unabated for some time. Spark has undertaken an initial impact assessment and has
determined that the rules do not apply in relation to its financial year ended 30 June 2024. Spark expects GloBE reporting obligations to
apply to its 30 June 2025 financial year (in respect of its CE’s in Australia and the United Kingdom). Additional GloBE reporting is expected
to commence in other regions in relation to Spark’s 2026 financial year. However, no top up taxes are expected to be paid due to the
availability of certain temporary safe harbours that apply through to 2028.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Other information


6.1 Income tax (continued)
Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AU$461 million at
30 June 2024 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2023: AU$461 million). These losses and temporary
differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the
production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority
requirements.
Spark has a negative 67 million imputation credit account balance as at 30 June 2024 due to the timing of dividend and tax payments
(30 June 2023: negative 32 million). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2024.

6.2 Employee share schemes
Spark operates a share-based compensation plan that is equity settled as outlined below.

Share option scheme
From September 2019, members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders have been granted options
under the new Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme. Under the scheme participants are granted options at the start of the three-
year vesting period. The number of options granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark
New Zealand shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment,
at vesting each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark
employment) then the options simply lapse, with exceptions for redundancy, death and disablement. Spark enables participants to meet
tax obligations through PAYE by authorising the sale of a sufficient number of shares on their behalf.
Vesting of the LTI grants are contingent on participants’ continued employment with Spark for three years from grant date (subject to
exceptions) and the Company achieving the specified performance hurdles. The performance hurdle targets are set annually and for
grants issued in 2020 and 2021 this was the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. For grants issued in 2022 and 2023,
75% of the allocated shares will vest based on the performance hurdle target of the Company's cost of equity plus 1.5% compounding
annually and 25% will vest based on performance against environmental and diversity targets. Options with an intrinsic value of $13
million (30 June 2023: $15 million) remain outstanding at 30 June 2024 and have a weighted average remaining life of 1.3 years (30 June
2023: 1.3 years).
Information regarding options awarded under this scheme is as follows:

                                                                                                                        2024         2023

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments is recognised as an expense, with a
corresponding entry in equity. The total charge recognised for this scheme for the year ended 30 June 2024 was $1.6 million (30 June
2023: $1.4 million). As at 30 June 2024, $2.5 million of share scheme awards remain unvested and not expensed (30 June 2023: $2.1
million). This expense, measured at its fair value based on a valuation model, will be recognised over the remaining vesting period of the
awards. On 3 October 2023 the options granted in September 2020 lapsed.

Independent auditor’s report




Independent auditor’s report
To the Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Opinion                        We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries (the
                               ‘Group’), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2024, and the
                               consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity
                               and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
                               including material accounting policy information.
                               In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 106 to 151, present fairly, in all
                               material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2024, and its consolidated
                               financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to
                               IFRS Accounting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’) as issued by the External Reporting Board and IFRS Accounting
                               Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board

Basis for opinion              We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and International
                               Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those standards are further
                               described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our
                               report.
                               We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
                               opinion.
                               We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code
                               of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by
                               the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
                               Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
                               Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
                               Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to regulatory audit
                               requirements, other assurance related services (such as trustee reporting, Greenhouse Gas Emissions limited
                               assurance and agreed upon procedures in relation to the sustainability-linked loans) and non-assurance
                               services provided to the Corporate Taxpayers Group, of which the Group is a member. These services have not
                               impaired our independence as auditor of the Company and Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has
                               both a sister and brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the
                               provision of any services to the Group and its subsidiaries, and this matter has not impacted our
                               independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the
                               ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. The firm has no other
                               relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

Audit materiality              We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements of the
                               Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
                               knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also
                               assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or
                               influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the
                               scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Key audit matters              Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
                               of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
                               our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
                               not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Director independence
As part of the formal independence assessment, the Board considered all business relationships and close personal ties between Spark and
any companies of which a non-executive director is an employee, director or substantial shareholder (if any). The Board has determined, based
on information provided by directors regarding their interests, that at 30 June 2024 Ms Barrass, Mr Bray, Ms Broadbent, Mr MacLeod, Ms
Nelson and Ms Smyth were independent. The Board (other than Ms Smyth) has considered the tenure of Ms Smyth who has been a Director for
12.7 years, and Chair for 5.9 years as at 30 June 2024. The Board determined that Ms Smyth’s understanding of Spark and experience and skills
in the industry add ongoing value to Spark. The Board are of the view that Ms Smyth’s tenure does not interfere with her capacity to bring an
independent judgment to bear on issues before the Board, to act in the best interests of Spark, and to represent the interests of its financial
product holders generally.
The Board determined that Ms Hodson was not independent due to her position as CEO, and Mr Havercroft was not independent due to his
prior relationships with Spark, which have now ceased.

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or,
in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive
director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as
at the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased
within a three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was within a three-year
period from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the
aggregate sale price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

162 Hello tomorrow
                                                                                                                                              Spark New Zealand Annual Report FY24




Sustainability appendix
As an integrated report we have included disclosure on our sustainability performance throughout this report. Pages 6 and 7 detail our
integrated reporting value creation model, aligned to the ‘capitals’ which each have a dedicated section in the report.
This report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core Option. It also
incorporates climate-related disclosures that have been prepared in compliance with the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS 1,
NZ CS 2 and NZ CS 3) issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB).
We publish a summary of our approach to sustainability at Spark on our website. www.spark.co.nz/online/about/sustainability/

Materiality
To prioritise Spark’s reporting on sustainability topics we follow the GRI materiality principle and processes (set out in GRI 3: Material Topics
2021) to identify and prioritise topics which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant
environmental, social, or economic impact. We also consider the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR>
Framework, considering whether a matter could substantively affect Spark's ability to create value in the short, medium, or long term.
We refresh our materiality analysis annually, as part of our integrated reporting process. Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of
stakeholder feedback, review of industry peers, and interviews with external stakeholders. In previous years we have also engaged an external
sustainability consultancy to independently review our materiality prioritisation. Internally we consult with a range of employees, including
members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk, legal, and HR teams, to determine Spark’s view of topics meeting the
GRI materiality principle criteria.
The purpose of our annual materiality review is to ensure we are capturing all topics that are material to our stakeholders, with a particular focus
on identifying emerging topics. We have updated our materiality matrix for FY24. This reflects feedback from various stakeholders which has
highlighted the increasing importance of data ethics, including data governance and sovereignty, with the increased profile and application of
AI technologies. In the previous year changes included increasing the importance of disaster crisis response and the role of digital technology
in addressing sustainability challenges.

Millimeter waves    millimeter waves, also known as extremely high frequency (EHF), is a band of radio frequencies that has
                    wavelengths between 1 mm and 10 mm. These frequencies can carry massive amounts of data at very high
                    speeds. That makes them ideal for accommodating the massive increase in data demanded from new 5G use
                    cases such as augmented/virtual reality, cloud gaming, video analytics and other cloud-compute capabilities.
Multi-access edge   extends the capabilities of cloud computing by bringing it to the ‘edge’ of the network. While traditional cloud
computing (MAEC)    computing occurs on remote servers that are situated far from the customer and device, MAEC allows this
                    processing to take place much closer to the end customer – meaning data has to travel a shorter distance,
                    decreasing latency, and the amount of data sent across the network can be reduced, reducing congestion, and
                    delivering a better customer experience.
Network slicing     allows the operator to ‘slice’ its network to support different types of services through each ‘slice’. Multiple slices
                    can be tuned independently to meet different quality of service parameters. For example, one slice may simply
                    need a standard speed connection to enable office email, another might be tuned to support very low data
                    Internet of Things devices, while another slice may need high reliability and ultra-low latency to support robotics.
