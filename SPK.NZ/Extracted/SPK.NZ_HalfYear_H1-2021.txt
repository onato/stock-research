NOTE 8 Dividends


On 24 February 2021, the Board approved the payment of a first half ordinary dividend of 12.5 cents
per share or approximately $231 million. The dividend will be 100% imputed in line with the
corporate income tax rate. In addition, supplementary dividends totalling approximately $24 million
will be payable to shareholders who are not resident in New Zealand. In accordance with the Income
Tax Act 2007, Spark will receive a tax credit from Inland Revenue equivalent to the amount of
supplementary dividends paid.
                                                                                                               H1 FY21

Independent Auditor’s Review Report
To the Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Conclusion
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial
statements’) of Spark New Zealand Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’), which
comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, and, the statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows
for the six months ended on that date, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information on pages 3 to 16.
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim
financial statements of the Group do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Group as at 31 December 2020 and its financial performance and cash flows for the six
months ended on that date in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34
Interim Financial Reporting.

Basis for Conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (‘NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)’). Our responsibilities
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Review of the Interim Financial
Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in
New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual financial statements, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in the area of taxation
advisory and compliance services and holiday pay compliance work. These services have not
impaired our independence as auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive
has both a sister and brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not
involved in the provision of any services to the Group and its subsidiaries and this matter has not
impacted our independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with Group on normal
terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. The firm has no
other relationship with, or interest in the Group.

Directors’ responsibilities for the interim financial statements
The directors are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation
of the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the interim financial statements
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review.
NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting.
Page 18         Spark New Zealand Interim financial statements




A review of the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited
assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily
of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those
performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) and consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we might identify
in an audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the interim financial statements.

Restriction on use
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our review has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to
state to them in a review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company’s shareholders as a body,
for our engagement, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
