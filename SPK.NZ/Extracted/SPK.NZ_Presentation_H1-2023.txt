                                                        •   TowerCo transaction delivered proceeds of $911 million(1) and a net gain on sale of $584 million
                                                        •   Decision to exit the sports streaming market resulted in a one-off provision of $52 million – enabling Spark to focus future capital investment in growth

                                                        •   The resulting net gain of the tower transaction and sport exit was $532 million, driving a 34.1% increase in reported revenue to $2,534 million, a 93.7%

              SHAREHOLDER VALUE                         •   Spark will also invest $350 million for growth, with ~$90-$110 million of incremental investment in digital infrastructure and emerging technologies in FY23
                                                        •   Declared an H1 FY23 dividend of 13.5 cents, 100% imputed and confirmed total FY23 dividend guidance of 27.0cps, 100% imputed


                                                        •   Like all businesses, Spark is navigating uncertain economic conditions as New Zealanders and businesses adapt to the inflationary environment
                                                        •   Since the conclusion of the half this has been compounded for many communities by recent extreme weather events. Spark has been focused on supporting
                                                            its customers and restoring services with urgency. While Spark’s services were affected, this was largely due to power outages and fibre cuts – with
                                                            mobile infrastructure remaining intact
                                                        •   Within the half, while core products and services remained resilient, higher product costs and intensifying broadband and cloud competition contributed to
                                                            margin pressure in the half, with adjusted EBITDAI down 5.2% to $510 million and adjusted NPAT down 7.8% to $165 million

                         OPERATING                          revenues return, and data-driven marketing differentiates Spark in the market
                        ENVIRONMENT                     •   Future markets are well positioned for growth, with healthcare sector digitisation expected to accelerate as public sector reforms progress, and Spark IoT
                                                            continuing to scale – reaching the milestone of 1.2 million connections during the half

                                                        •   As reported in the FY22 results, the scaling of public cloud in New Zealand resulted in a repricing of private cloud, reducing revenues and eroding margins.
