We're
with you.
The pace of digital change is unrelenting.
New Zealanders expect more every day. More
coverage. The latest products. Greater speed.
Better bargains. The latest content. New ways of
doing business. We’re with you. We want to help all
of New Zealand win big in a digital world. Is that
ambitious? Absolutely. Too ambitious? Never. It’s
bold and strong and requires commitment and
purpose. And to deliver on it, at Spark we know we
need to keep changing. We’re good with that.

         Customers
         leading
         the way.
         Customer experience is the new source of competitive
         advantage. To succeed, we are concentrating our time
         and energy on the things that matter for customers.
         That means the experience you have when you join
         Spark, when you use our products, when you want to
         change your plan or need help. We are making sure
         when we get feedback from customers, we use this
         to help shape the products of the future.
         We understand customer journeys deeply and are
         working out where there are sources of frustration
         so we can make the experience truly market-leading.
         This means being nimble enough to improve things
         iteratively or change tack quickly and seamlessly.

         A different
         pace.
         We talk a lot about the new pace of normal
         – by which we mean Spark changing faster on
         the inside than the world is changing around us.
         We are looking for ways to keep up with new
         products and services, because our customers
         rightly don’t want to wait.
         We’re in an environment where people expect
         stuff to happen immediately – or as close to it as
         possible. Introducing new products and improving
         existing ones has to be done in much shorter time
         frames. Spark is now doing in days what used to
         happen in weeks or months.

         A shared
         sense of
         purpose.
         In today’s workforce, people don’t just want a job.
         They want to be part of an organisation with a clear
         purpose and to know the contribution they can make.
         They don’t want to just do what they’re told.
         Instead success will depend on our people being
         truly, deeply engaged with our purpose and having
         a clear sense of how the work they do is making
         a difference for customers.

For FY19, subject to there being no material adverse changes in operating outlook, Spark anticipates paying an annual total dividend of
25 cents per share. This is likely to be made up of an ordinary dividend determined by earnings, topped up by a special dividend to
maintain a total dividend of 25.0 cents per share. It is currently anticipated that the FY19 ordinary and special dividend will be at least
75% imputed. The dividend reinvestment plan remains suspended.

2.2 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

Revenue from cloud, security and service management contracts
• Revenue from contractual arrangements, including IT services contracts to design and build IT solutions, generally comprise
  multiple products and services. Such contracts often require Spark to integrate a bundle of goods or services that represent a
  combined output for the customer. As such, the arrangement is accounted for and revenue recognised in relation to these
  bundled goods and services or the contract as a whole.
• Costs incurred to fulfil such contractual arrangements may be deferred and recognised in operating expenses over the life of the
  contract to the extent that they are recoverable from future revenue.


     Key estimates and assumptions
     The revenue recognition on contracts that span more than one accounting period may be impacted by estimates of the
     total costs, ultimate profitability or other appropriate inputs. These revenues are also subject to ongoing profitability
     reviews of underlying contracts to determine whether the latest estimates applied remain appropriate.
                                                                                                                                    Page 55




2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)
Revenue arrangements with multiple elements
• Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
  service. When products or services are not considered to be distinct, they are combined into a bundle that is distinct or the
  arrangement is accounted for as a whole.
• A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
  resources that are readily available.
• Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its fair value and recognised when, or as, control is
  transferred to the customer.
• Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for
                                                                                                                                              2
  services, control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    Determining the fair value of distinct products or services in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can be
    complex and is subject to judgement.

Gain on sale
In the year ended 30 June 2018 a gain on sale of $10 million arose from the sale of 50% of Connect 8 Limited, being the difference
between the proceeds received and the fair value of Spark’s retained 50% interest and the net assets sold. In the year ended
30 June 2017 Spark sold surplus land in Mayoral Drive, Auckland for cash proceeds of $27 million. The land had a carrying value of
$7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $20 million.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
receivables is estimated to be $208 million (30 June 2017: $243 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables,
measured at amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value because of the short term to maturity.

Finance lease receivables
Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for
space in Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and
are therefore shown as a net finance lease receivable on the statement of financial position.
The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

The leases have multiple rights of renewal and the full lease terms have been used in the calculation of the net financial lease
receivable, as it is likely that due to the specialised nature of the buildings, the leases will be renewed to the maximum terms.

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Expected credit loss allowance provision
As outlined in note 1.1 Spark has early adopted the final version of NZ IFRS 9, which includes a single, forward-looking, ‘expected
loss’ impairment model. The expected credit loss allowance provision was recalculated using the new NZ IFRS 9 model as at 1 July
2017 and the cumulative impact of the change has been adjusted through retained earnings and as such no comparative
information has been presented.
Movements in the loss allowance provision for the year ended 30 June 2018, including this adjustment, are as follows:

Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime
expected loss provision for trade receivables, unbilled revenue, finance lease receivables and other receivables. This has resulted
in an increase in provisioning for expected credit losses on application of NZ IFRS 9, as losses are recognised earlier. Previously,
allowances for credit losses were only recognised when a trigger event occurred, such as late or non-payment. Further, the level of
provisioning was based primarily on historical information and trends in relation to recoverability.
The loss allowance provision recognised under NZ IFRS 9 now includes expected credit loss provisions for certain trade
receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables and other receivables for which provisions were previously not
recognised. Further, the calculation of the allowance provision now incorporates forward-looking information, such as forecasted
economic conditions.
The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                      Current    ≤ 1 Month     > 1 Month        Total

    Key estimates and assumptions
    The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected
    loss rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the
    inputs to the impairment calculation based on Spark’s past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as
    forward-looking estimates at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of
    forecasted changes to interest rates, unemployment rates and gross domestic product in New Zealand.

Content rights inventory
Spark enters into contracts for the right to stream digital content for sport and to subscribers of Lightbox. Content rights are stated
at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation of content rights is recognised within
operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their licence periods or, for live sports content, over its broadcast period. The
content rights amortisation charge for the year ended 30 June 2018 was $20 million (30 June 2017: $19 million).

Notes to the financial statements: Operating assets and liabilities
3.4 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

    Key estimates and assumptions
    Spark’s property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of an asset of property, plant and equipment requires
    management judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will
    make the asset obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
    The estimated useful lives of Spark’s property, plant and equipment is as follows:
    Telecommunications equipment and plant
          Junctions and trunk transmission systems 10 – 50 years
          Switching equipment	  5 – 12 years
          Customer premises equipment	  3 – 5 years
          Other network equipment	  2 – 25 years
          Buildings	  9 – 50 years
    Other assets
          Motor vehicles	  6 years
          Furniture and fittings	  2 – 25 years
          Computer equipment	  3 – 5 years
    The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors; such as changes in current competitive
    conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected
    future cash flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists.
    Key judgements include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an
    appropriate discount rate for valuing future cash flows.

     impairment annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement,
     including its expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the
     likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark intangible assets is as follows:
     Software	  2 – 8 years
     Capacity                                                        15 – 25 years
     Spectrum licences                                               17 – 20 years
     Other intangible assets
          Customer contracts and brands	  5 – 10 years
          Other intangible assets	  5 – 80 years

Goodwill of $22 million was recognised on acquisition of Ubiquity and Digital Island, as outlined in note 4.2, including $4 million
allocated to the Spark Home, Mobile & Business and Spark Digital CGU’s. Goodwill of $3 million was derecognised on the sale of
50% of Connect 8.
During the years ended 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of goodwill. Headroom
currently exists in each CGU and, based on sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions
would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment by estimating the future cash flows, based on Board-approved business
    plans, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial
    information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU performance. The major inputs and
    assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include revenue forecasts, operating
    cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future technology paths.
    Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs except Qrious, where 2% was applied and a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1%
    was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2018 (30 June 2017: 11.2%).

Notes to the financial statements: Group structure
4.1 Long-term investments (continued)
Spark’s exit of App La Carte Limited and write down of its holding in Vigil Monitoring Limited resulted in impairments of $4 million
during the year ended 30 June 2018.
Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited
(together ‘Southern Cross’) as their carrying value has been reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross’ deficits
or repay dividends. Spark’s share of Southern Cross profits not recognised for the year ended 30 June 2018 was $51 million (30
June 2017: $46 million) due to the existence of historic cumulative Southern Cross deficits not recognised.


4.2 Business combinations
Business combinations during the year include:
• On 4 July 2017 Spark acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Ubiquity Software Limited and the business assets of the Ubiquity
  Technologies Trust (together ‘Ubiquity’). Ubiquity is a marketing automation provider and the acquisition blends its considerable
  marketing software strengths together with the powerful smarts of Spark’s big data and analytics software business Qrious
  Limited.
• On 22 November 2017 Spark acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Digital Island Limited (Digital Island). Digital Island is a
  New Zealand-based business telecommunications provider.
• During the year Spark issued termination notices and made payments to third party licensees of 29 retail stores, moving these
  stores away from management by dealer partners to direct management. Moving away from a dealer partner model to directly
  owned retail stores allows Spark to showcase digital experiences to customers in an interactive retail environment and create
  consistent experiences for customers. The reacquired licensee rights have been measured at fair value and recognised as an
  intangible asset.
Total consideration paid in relation to these transactions was $51 million. Goodwill recognised from the acquisitions of $22 million
has been allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the transaction. Goodwill of $13 million has been
allocated to the Digital Island CGU, $5 million to the Qrious CGU and $4 million to the Spark Home, Mobile & Business and Spark
Digital CGUs.
The following values were recognised in the financial statements in respect of the Ubiquity, Digital Island and retail store
transactions:

                                                                                                                               2018

Ubiquity and Digital Island contributed operating revenues of $21 million for the period to 30 June 2018. If the acquisitions had
occurred on 1 July 2017, it is estimated that the contribution to Spark’s operating revenues would have been $29 million.

Notes to the financial statements: Funding and risk
Section 5 Funding and risk

In this section
This section provides details on Spark’s funding, derivatives, hedge accounting and the financial and capital risks that arise from
our operations. This includes our exposure to currency, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks and our strategy for managing them.
Spark also manages capital (equity and debt) considering shareholders’ interests and our credit rating.



5.1 Debt
Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and
measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value
changes attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is
recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

None of Spark’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark’s debt,
however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of
default over Spark’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017.
The fair value of long-term debt, including amounts due within one year, (calculated based on the present value of future principal
and interest cash flows, discounted at market interest rates at balance date) was $1,072 million compared to a carrying value of
$1,048 million as at 30 June 2018 (30 June 2017: fair value of $862 million compared to a carrying value of $832 million).

Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and
foreign exchange. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other than
quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017 no
derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for
offsetting of any derivative financial instruments is immaterial.

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The
nature and the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement
are recognised. Derivatives are designed as:
• Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt;
• Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions; and
• Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the
  variability in cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of
an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of
respective cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash
flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected
in the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
                                                                                                                                                  5
Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and
foreign exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable
rate debt and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping fixed rate into variable rate debt.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made
within 12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over
this period.
A reconciliation of movements in the cash flow hedge reserve, net of tax, is outlined below:
                                                                                                                        2018           2017

Other amounts deferred in equity will be transferred to the statement of profit or loss over the next seven years (30 June 2017:

5.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting (continued)
Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from
remeasuring the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income.
During the year ended 30 June 2018 Spark recognised a $6 million gain on fair value hedges and a $6 million loss on hedged
exposures (30 June 2017: $14 million loss on fair value hedges and a $14 million gain on hedged exposures) and there has been
no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships.

Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark issued Australian dollar (AUD) denominated debt on 12 October 2017. As part of Spark’s risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps were entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuance to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility,
the cross-currency interest rate swaps were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The cross-currency
basis element of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other
comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the cross-currency interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised
in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, gains or losses deferred in the cash flow
hedge reserve will be reclassified to Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal
amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
The change in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the foreign currency basis component of the cross-currency
interest-rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate cost of hedging equity reserve.
Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.
The details of the hedging instruments as at 30 June 2018 are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                           CHANGE IN

5.3 Financial and capital risk management

a) Financial market risk
Spark is exposed to financial market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Spark
employs risk management strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments to manage these exposures through a
Board-approved treasury policy, which provides the framework within which treasury-related activities are conducted.
Spark monitors the use of derivative financial instruments using well-defined market and credit risk limits and timely reports to
senior management. All contracts have been entered into with major creditworthy financial institutions. The risk associated with
these transactions is that the fair value or cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market rates,
coupled with the cost of replacing these agreements at the current market rates in the event of default by the counterparty.

Currency risk
Nature of the risk
Currency risk is the risk that eventual New Zealand dollar net cash flows from transactions undertaken by Spark will be adversely
                                                                                                                                                                     5
affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Exposure and risk management
Spark’s total exposure (from non-derivative financial instruments) to foreign currency as at 30 June 2018 is $203 million (30 June
2017: $94 million). This includes $163 million long-term debt denominated in AUD (30 June 2017: nil) and $34 million long-term
debt denominated in GBP (30 June 2017: $72 million). The remaining exposure is primarily trade payables and other receivables
denominated in United States dollars (USD).
Spark manages currency risk arising from debt not denominated in New Zealand dollars through hedging. Spark’s long-term debt
issued in AUD and GBP is fully hedged using cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert these borrowings into a floating rate
New Zealand dollar exposure.
Currency risk from capital and operational expenditure in foreign currencies (and related trade payables) has been substantially
hedged by entering into forward exchange contracts.
Sensitivity to foreign currency movements
As at 30 June 2018 a movement of 10% in the New Zealand dollar would impact the statement of profit or loss and statement of
changes in equity (after hedging) by less than $14 million (30 June 2017: $17 million). This analysis assumes a movement in the
New Zealand dollar across all currencies and only includes the effect of foreign exchange movements on monetary financial
instruments.

The Board continues to be committed to the Company maintaining a single ‘A Band’ credit rating and its capital management
policies are designed to ensure this objective is met. As part of this commitment Spark manages its debt levels to ensure that the
ratio of net interest-bearing debt (inclusive of associated derivatives) to EBITDA does not materially exceed 1.4 times on a long-run
basis, which, for credit ratings agency purposes, Spark estimates equates approximately to adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.5 times.
The difference between these two ratios is primarily due to the credit rating agency making adjustments for operating leases and
captive finance operations.
As at 30 June 2018 the Company’s Standard & Poor’s credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was A- and A-2 respectively,
with outlook stable (30 June 2017: same).

Net debt
Net debt includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash.
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management. The
following table reconciles long-term debt at hedged rates to long-term debt at spot rates as reported under NZ IFRS:

Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AUD$461
million at 30 June 2018 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2017: AUD$467 million). These losses and
temporary differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is
contingent on the production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant
taxation authority requirements.
Spark has a negative imputation credit account balance of $45 million as at 30 June 2018 (30 June 2017: $47 million negative
balance). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017.

6.3 Employee share schemes
Spark operates share-based compensation plans that are equity settled as outlined below.

Restricted share schemes
A restricted share scheme was initially introduced for selected employees in September 2001. For new allocations after August
2015 these were replaced by two new restricted share schemes:
• Spark New Zealand Long Term Incentive Scheme; and
• Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long Term Incentive Scheme.
The Spark New Zealand Long Term Incentive Scheme is for the Leadership Team and senior managers and delivers one scheme
with the same set of rules under one long-term incentive, with a performance hurdle in place. The Spark New Zealand Managing
Director Long Term Incentive Scheme replaced the Managing Director performance rights scheme.
Under these restricted share schemes ordinary shares in the Company are issued to Spark Trustee Limited. Participants purchase
shares from Spark Trustee Limited with funds lent to them by the Company and which are held on their behalf by Spark Trustee
Limited. If the individual is still employed by Spark at the end of the vesting period (generally three years) and applicable
performance hurdles are met, the employee is provided a cash bonus, which must be used to repay the loan and the shares are
then transferred to the individual. The target for this hurdle is the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually, with
the exception of one-off exceptional grants issued in FY14 for which the hurdle was two times Spark’s annual cost of equity
compounding over three years.

Share rights schemes
The Share Rights Scheme (SRS) was used for selected Leadership Team members and senior employees, and the Managing
Director Performance Rights Scheme (PRS) for the Managing Director. The final grants under these schemes were made in
September 2014 and were exercisable from September 2017.
Under the SRS and PRS participants were granted rights to purchase Company shares at a nil cost strike price. Share rights have no
voting rights until exercised and generally cannot be exercised for a three-year period. The share rights were exercisable at the end
of the vesting period only if the individual was still employed by Spark and, in the case of the Leadership Team and the Managing
Director, a total shareholder return performance hurdle was met. The target for this hurdle was the Company’s cost of equity plus
1% compounding annually, with the exception of one-off exceptional grants issued in FY14 for which the hurdle was two times
Spark’s annual cost of equity compounding over three years. The final options under the SRS and PRS were exercised during the
year ended 30 June 2018 and none remain outstanding as at 30 June 2018.
Information regarding shares and options awarded under these schemes is as follows:
                                                                                                         RSS           SRS          PRS

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments is recognised as an expense, with
a corresponding entry in equity. The total charge recognised for these schemes for the year ended 30 June 2018 was $3 million
(30 June 2017: $4 million); the expense relating to the restricted share schemes was $2 million (30 June 2017: $3 million) and the
expense relating to all SRS and PRS awards was $1 million (30 June 2017: $1 million). As at 30 June 2018, $3 million of share
scheme awards remain unvested and not expensed (30 June 2017: $4 million). This expense, measured at its fair value based on a
valuation model, will be recognised over the remaining vesting period of the awards.
Spark Share, an employee share purchase programme, does not have a material impact on these financial statements.

               International Financial Reporting Standards.




                      Basis for opinion
          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). We
          believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
          We are independent of the group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised) Code of Ethics
          for Assurance Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the
          International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code),
          and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.
          Our responsibilities under ISAs (NZ) are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
          consolidated financial statements section of our report.
          Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to regulatory audit, other assurance related
          services (such as trustee reporting) and compliance services. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and
          employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities
          of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as auditor of the group. The firm
          has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.




                      Materiality
          The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Materiality helped us to determine the
          nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
          and on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The materiality for the consolidated financial statements
          as a whole was set at $26 million determined with reference to a benchmark of group earnings before income
          tax. We chose the benchmark because, in our view, this is a key measure of the group’s performance.
                                                                                                                     Page 85




           Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
the consolidated financial statements in the current period. We summarise below those matters and our key audit
procedures to address those matters in order that the shareholders as a body may better understand the process
by which we arrived at our audit opinion. Our procedures were undertaken in the context of and solely for the
purpose of our statutory audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole and we do not express
discrete opinions on separate elements of the consolidated financial statements.

 statements as a restructuring expense

Restructuring expenses are included within

key audit matter due to the judgement in

light of the timing of decisions to restructure

and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.



           Use of this independent auditor’s report

                 Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial
          statements
          The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for:
          — the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
              accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
              Reporting Standards) and International Financial Reporting Standards;
          — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a consolidated set of financial
              statements that is fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
          — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related
              to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
              cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.



                       Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
                       statements
          Our objective is:


          — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
              from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
          — to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
          Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
          with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
          Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
          they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
          consolidated financial statements.
          A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of these consolidated financial statements is located at
          the External Reporting Board (XRB) website at:
          http://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurance-practitioners/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/

  This includes providing New Zealand-based directors with mobile phones and a $120 per month home phone account credit and overseas-based directors with a $400 per month

Director independence and interests
The Board has determined, based on information provided by directors regarding their interests, that at 30 June 2018: Ms Barrass,
Mr Berriman, Ms Gerry, Ms Greenwood, Mr Leffler, Mr Sitch and Ms Smyth were independent.

The position in respect of Ms Greenwood changed as a result of her appointment as the interim CEO of Russell McVeagh on 16 August
2018. Ms Greenwood joined the Board of Spark on 1 April 2018 and at 30 June 2018, was a Partner and board member of Russell
McVeagh, a law firm that continues to provide professional services to Spark. At those dates the Board determined Ms Greenwood to be
independent, based on a number of factors including that the relationship with Russell McVeagh is handled at management level and
that upon confirmation of her appointment, Ms Greenwood immediately ceased providing services to Spark in her capacity as a Partner
of Russell McVeagh. Certain protocols were also put into place to further mitigate any risk of influence arising, which apply in addition to
the Board’s usual conflict of interest procedures.

Following Ms Greenwood’s appointment as interim CEO of Russell McVeagh, the Board determined that she was not independent, due
to the increased risk that, while serving as interim CEO, Ms Greenwood could be perceived to be materially influenced when making
decisions as a director of Spark. The protocols, put in place to mitigate the risk of influence arising, were expanded to cater for this role.

The Board determined that Mr Moutter was not independent due to his position as Managing Director. Further information regarding
director independence independence and conflict of interest may be found at: www.sparknz.co.nz/about/governance.

  The table does not include: amounts paid after 30 June 2018 relating to FY18; long-term incentives that have been granted and have yet to vest (based on grant values, the total
  value of which was NZ$9.03 million as at 30 June 2018); product and service concessions received by employees; contributions paid to the Government Superannuation Fund (a
  legacy benefit provided to a small number of employees); and, if the individual is a KiwiSaver member, contributions of 3% of gross earnings towards that individual’s KiwiSaver
  scheme.
* Denotes number of employees who received benefits from the one-off FY14 Exceptional LTI, i.e. *is one employee and ** is two employees.


FY14 Exceptional LTI Grant

The employee remuneration information in the table above includes the value of 40% of the FY14 Exceptional LTI vesting outcomes,
which totalled $5.4 million across 27 employees (excluding the Managing Director). The remaining 60% vested in FY17.

As noted in the FY14 annual report, the FY14 Exceptional LTI was granted in November 2013. Vesting of these awards was conditional
on the achievement of a TSR hurdle of 74%, being 2 x Spark’s annual cost of equity compounding over the three years to 30 November
2016. Spark’s actual TSR over the same period was 85%, which resulted in 100% vesting.

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the
Chair, or in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that
each non-executive director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director
base member fee as at the date of their appointment, or in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, as at 1 July 2017. Shares
are to be purchased within a three year period from the date of appointment, or in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017,
within a three-year period from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares
acquired, less the aggregate sale price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.
