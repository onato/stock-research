Sustainability performance continues to mature
Spark remains committed to its FY30 SBTi1 emissions reduction target and is taking meaningful steps to work towards it


 Rising national grid emissions factor contributed to FY25 emissions increase
 • Underlying performance improvements, with electricity consumption down 4.9%
 • The winter energy crisis (caused by reduced hydro generation) drove the grid emissions factor up –
   contributing to an 11% YoY increase in scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are tracking 42% above our
   SBTi 2030 emissions reduction target pathway

 Renewable partnership will decouple reported electricity emissions from national grid factor
 • Ten-year renewable energy partnership with Genesis Energy commenced in Q3, when the Lauriston
   Solar Farm began generation
 • Enables Spark to reduce reported electricity emissions by linking to new renewable generation –
   totalling a 3,954 tCO2e reduction in H2 (market-based)

 Spark continues to support digital equity and safety
 • Skinny Jump now supporting close to 34,000 households in need with subsidised broadband
 • 5G now in 130 locations, covering over half of the population
 • Close to 1.3 million SMS scam texts blocked on Spark’s network since October 2024

Appendix
FY25 reported and adjusted earnings reconciliation
 • The data centre business has been classified in the Financial Statements as a discontinuing operation held for sale at 30 June 2025 in accordance with the requirements of
   NZ GAAP. As a result, the revenue and expense items for both FY25 and FY24 have been separated from continuing operations of Spark and disclosed separately in the
   profit and loss in the financial statements as net earnings after tax from discontinuing operations.

 • To assist in comparability, and reporting in a manner consistent with market guidance, the discontinuing operations have been added back to the profit and loss in the
   adjusted earnings calculations. The attached table provides a reconciliation Reported to Adjusted earnings.

                                                                                    FY24                                                                                                  FY25
