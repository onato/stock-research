              FY21 Operating Conditions and Performance
          •     Stronger than expected New Zealand economic recovery, with low unemployment and GDP back in growth.

          •     Closed international borders and the loss of roaming revenue resulted in top-line revenue decline.

          •     Strong underlying revenue performance in mobile and cloud, security and service management.

          •     Delivered FY21 EBITDAI(1) growth at the top end of the guidance range through disciplined cost management.

          •     NPAT decline driven by higher depreciation and amortisation costs and increase in tax expense.

          •     Declared FY21 total dividend of 25 cents per share, 100% imputed, supported by resilient free cash flow.

          •     Phase one of Spark’s Infrastructure Review completed, with further significant infrastructure investments planned
                for FY22 – including accelerated 5G rollout and datacentre capacity expansion.

          •     Further opportunities identified to drive value from the passive components of Spark’s mobile network and fibre. Spark
                is actively exploring shared ownership models; however, discussions are ongoing and there is no certainty that any
                transaction will proceed.

          Strategic Update: Sustainability
          Significant progress establishing strong sustainability foundations across Spark:

          •     Launched new Sustainability Framework to the market and operationalised it into the business.

          •     Grew Skinny Jump connections by 5.6k – a 58% increase vs. FY20 and surpassing 15k
                connections in total by year end.

          •     Spark Foundation continued to pursue its vision of ‘no New Zealander being left behind in a
                digital world’, focussing on digital access, digital skills and pathways and digital wellbeing.

          •     Introduced a new Environment Policy to guide internal decision making.

          •     Assessed climate change risks and opportunities across the business, aligned to the Taskforce for
                Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and incorporated into reporting.

          •     Set a science-based emissions reduction target, approved by the Science Based Target Initiative.

          •     Focus now shifting to designing and executing an emissions reduction plan and supporting
                businesses to harness the power of technology to shift to a low-carbon future.
