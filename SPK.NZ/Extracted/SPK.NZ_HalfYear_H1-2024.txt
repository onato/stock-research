NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 3 Segment information

The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how
Spark reviews its performance. Spark’s segments are measured based on product margin, which
includes product operating revenues and direct product costs. The segment results exclude other
gains, labour, other operating expenses, finance income and expense, depreciation and
amortisation, net investment income and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall
Group level by the Chief Executive.

Comparative segment results
Spark has reclassified the comparative segment results to:
• Redistribute certain revenues between two new categories IT products (previously cloud,
  collaboration, managed data and networks) and IT services (previously service management and
  security
• Move Qrious, Internet of Things, and MATTR from other products into a new high-tech category
• Split data centres out from cloud, and split co-location out from other products to create a
  combined data centres category.
There is no change to the overall Spark reported result because of these changes.

Note 4 Non-GAAP measures

Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in
the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These
measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-
based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be
viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ
IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the
telecommunications industry.

Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation
and net investment income (EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back finance expense, depreciation and amortisation and
income tax expense and subtracting finance income and net investment income (which includes
Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures, interest income on loans
receivable from associates and joint ventures, net gain on remeasurement of equity accounted
investments and dividend income) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI and adjusted
EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with, those presented
in these interim financial statements.

Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year
includes significant items (such as gains, expenses and impairments) individually greater than
$25 million. In the six months ended 31 December 2023 there were no adjusting items. In the six
months ended 31 December 2022, the net gain on sale of Connexa of $584 million and the one off
provision of $52 million for Spark Sport were deemed significant items to adjust.

Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at
the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash. Net
debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge adjustments and any
unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but
is a measure used by management. A reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt at
carrying value is provided below:

1 Net debt at hedged rates is the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity and includes an adjustment to state
  the principal of foreign currency medium term notes at the hedged currency rate.
2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in
  dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

  Receipts (ADRs), are traded over-the-counter in the United States. This is a Level 1 ADR programme that is sponsored by
  Bank of New York Mellon. For H1 FY24, these are based on the exchange rate at 23 February 2024 of NZ$1 to US$0.6195
  and a ratio of five ordinary shares per one American Depositary Share. The actual exchange rate used for conversion is
  determined in the week prior to payment when the Bank of New York performs the physical currency conversion.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report
to The Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Conclusion
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial
statements’) of Spark New Zealand Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) on
pages 3 to 17 which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and, the
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and
statement of cash flows for the six months ended on that date, and notes to the interim financial
statements, including material accounting policy information.
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim
financial statements of the Group do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and its financial performance and cash flows for the six
months ended on that date in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34
Interim Financial Reporting.

Basis for Conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (‘NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)’). Our responsibilities
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Review of the Interim Financial
Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in
New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to the regulatory
audit, other assurance related services (such as trustee reporting), compliance services and non-
assurance services provided to the Corporate Taxpayer Group. These services have not impaired our
independence as auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a sister and
brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the provision
of any services to the Company and its subsidiaries and this matter has not impacted our
independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with Group on normal terms within the
ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. The firm has no other relationship
with, or interest in the Group.

Directors’ responsibilities for the interim financial statements
The directors are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of
the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the interim financial statements
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review.
NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting.
A review of the interim financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited
assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily
of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those
performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) and consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we might identify in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the interim financial statements.

Restriction on use
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our review has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to
state to them in a review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company’s shareholders as a body,
for our engagement, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
