Empowering the people
and businesses creating
Aotearoa’s tomorrow
The 2023 financial year saw us complete the three-year strategy we
started in mid-2020, while setting a path for the future.
Our last strategy started at a time when the world around us was
turned upside down by COVID-19. While the most challenging days
of the pandemic are now behind us, its impacts linger on and
Aotearoa continues to change rapidly.
New Zealand is getting bigger, older, and more diverse and globally
we now face greater political volatility and cost of living challenges
than we have for many years. Compounding this is the universal
challenge of climate change, which is causing more frequent and
extreme weather events on our shores and highlighting the urgent
need for adaptation and our transition to a low-carbon economy.
Despite these challenges, we are optimistic about our country’s
future and the role Spark can play in supporting its growth.
That’s why our mission for the years ahead is to empower the
people and businesses creating Aotearoa’s tomorrow.
We will bring New Zealanders the best digital-first experiences,
curated to their needs. We will invest in the networks and high-tech
solutions that embolden our customers to innovate, grow and
become more sustainable through technology. We will create an
innovation culture that fuels our progress and equips our people
to thrive in an increasingly digital world. And we will do it all
without wavering from our commitments to Toitū Sustainability
and Te Korowai Tupu – our Māori Strategy.

About this report




•      This is an integrated report that shares our financial, social, environmental and
       economic performance. To inform our approach we’ve applied the
       International <IR> Framework, which considers the creation of value over the
       short, medium and long term, thinking holistically about the resources and
       relationships the organisation uses or affects and the dependencies and
       trade-offs between them as value is created.                                                                                                                         Key dates
•      At the heart of this approach is the <IR> value creation model (laid out on
       pages 6 and 7), which details the ‘capitals’ we draw upon, our strategy and                                                                                        Annual Meeting

     payments for provisional tax in FY23 and higher payments
     for interest on leases, driven by interest on the new
     Connexa lease.
•    Investing cash inflows were $917 million higher than the
     prior year largely due to net proceeds from the sale of
     Connexa of $893 million, after transaction costs, and $11
     million of cash proceeds from the sale of assets. Reduced
     payments to long-term investments offset increased spend
     in capital assets due to additional spend in growth
     opportunities. Payments for spectrum represent a
     prepayment for spectrum rights to be received in FY24.
•    Financing cash outflows increased by $846 million primarily
     due to net repayments of debt in FY23 using Connexa
     proceeds, $146 million of share repurchases under the
     on-market share buy-back programme and higher payments
     for dividends due to an increase in the H1 FY23 dividend to
     13.5 cents.
•    Free cash flow was $56 million higher in FY23, driven by the
     increase in EBITDAI and lower payments for the capital
     expenditure included in free cash flow1, partially offset by
     increases in payments for interest and tax outlined above.




1 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated on page 9 of
  Spark’s FY23 Detailed Financials. The prior year comparative has been
  restated to align with the FY23 definition for free cash flow.

Spark 5G Street Museum:
A 5G-powered, augmented
reality experience
From August 2022 through to June 2023,
we put a modern twist on the traditional
museum experience through our 5G Street
Museum – demonstrating what emerging
technologies like 5G can bring to art,
culture and entertainment. The Museum
showcased a co-created series of
5G-powered augmented reality (AR)
experiences that brought to life unseen
stories of some of our nation’s most iconic
creatives – Parris Goebel, Benee, David
Dallas, Teeks and Askew One.
The Spark 5G Street Museum app was
available free to download for all, with
exhibits initially available to view across
selected streets in Auckland, Hamilton,
Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.
Each exhibition explored new forms of
storytelling and self-expression through
the power of 5G and AR.

•   Maturity assessments: Our goal is to
    always be aligned with, or even exceed,
    the latest industry standards, to
    consistently elevate our cyber security
    maturity. We audit our security maturity
    through internal and external audits,
    with frameworks like NIST, SOC-CMM
    and a proprietary CMMI Maturity model
    developed by Accenture forming the
    backbone of these assessments. In
    FY23 we also partnered with Google’s
    Mandiant to undertake a
    comprehensive maturity assessment,
    which will aid in our bi-annual external
    board assurance audit.
•   Alignment with Spark’s business
    strategy: Our cyber security strategy is
    carefully aligned to both our wider
    business strategy and the network
    evolution strategy to ensure it can
    support the business as it evolves.
People also play a critical role in helping to
detect and defend against potential cyber
security threats. For that reason, everyone
at Spark is required to undertake regular
cyber security training modules, to equip
them in identifying and helping to mitigate
potential threats.
We have a large security operations team
with over 100 security subject matter
experts and processes that ensure
appropriate ownership, oversight and
ongoing risk management is applied to our
customers’ and Spark’s IT systems and data.
Our Incident Response Plan governs how
we respond to threats, and we have
invested heavily in our threat intelligence

Trialling 5G and AI-powered industrial
robotics with the University of Auckland
We have been working with researchers
from the University of Auckland to explore
the potential of 5G to transform the world
of industrial robotics. Industrial robots are
commonly used in electronics, food and
medical manufacturing as they can be
programmed to carry out automated tasks
with precision and accuracy. In a recent
trial, a research team from the University's
Faculty of Engineering explored whether
they could be controlled remotely in the
cloud via a 5G network.
The researchers measured the connection’s
latency (whether there is any ‘lag’) and jitter
(how reliable and consistent the connection
is) by testing various public and private 5G
network settings and sending data
between Auckland, Sydney, London,
Singapore and Oregon (USA). Through this
trial the team learned that the key to
achieving optimal speeds and reliability
performance is to incorporate artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms to compensate
for any issues during data transmission.
In the long term, the researchers imagine
this technology could have the potential to
enable a range of activities that are not
possible today – for example, the remote
operation of robots to work in dangerous
environments.

24.2% on the previous year, with increased
fuel use across all areas of our fleet. In our

Health and safety
Spark has a well-established health and
safety management system, focussed on
continuous improvement. Our Health,
Safety and Wellbeing Strategy is built
around four pillars which are:
•   Strategy and Framework: A strong
    health and safety management
    framework providing a platform for
    success
•   Hazard and Risk Management:
    Proactive ‘owners’ approach to health
    and safety and the management of
    critical hazards and associated risks
•   Leadership and Ownership: A culture of
    empowerment at every level
•   Resources and Supporting Activity:
    A commitment by the business to
    ensuring the resources and capabilities
    are in place to deliver the health and
    safety strategy.
No Spark employee or contractor suffered
serious injury or death over the year, and
our TRIFR (Total Recordable Incident
Frequency Rate) held flat at 2.13 for FY23.
No notifiable events were reported under
current New Zealand Health and Safety
legislation or health and safety
prosecutions or notices issued to Spark by
WorkSafe (New Zealand Regulator) during
the same period.
Based on the experiences of the last few
years, our pandemic planning and
response activities now incorporate lessons
from COVID-19 and the impact severe
weather events have had on our people
and places across New Zealand. We
continue to follow a risk-based approach
for our activities and work collaboratively
across the business to ensure we have the
right response and resources in place to
support emergency preparedness.
In FY23 we continued to work with our

Creating value for our people




Diversity, equity
and inclusion
Our focus and commitment on diversity,
equity and inclusion is embedded into our
day-to-day activities, standards and
business practices. It is a strategic business
priority and key enabler of our business
strategy and culture.
This focus has helped us create an
environment where our people feel
comfortable bringing their whole selves to
work, regardless of gender, ethnicity,
orientation, age, experience,
neurodivergence or ability.
In November, Spark’s efforts to create a
more inclusive and equitable work
environment was recognised at the Deloitte
Top 200 Awards, receiving the Diversity
and Inclusion Award for 2023.

Spark’s Blue Heart kaupapa
in action
Our Blue Heart kaupapa sets the standards
of behaviour, alongside our values,
to foster a culture of connection and
belonging. It is a visible icon of our
heart-led approach to diversity and
inclusion.
Blue Heart cultural celebrations and events
remain an important part of bringing our
people together and in FY23 we
celebrated key moments, such as
International Women’s Day (IWD), Lunar
New Year, Diwali, Eid celebrations and
Matariki events at our offices throughout
the country.

Our governance and ESG management




Our governance and ESG management

To achieve our purpose, Spark must
successfully execute our business strategy
while maintaining high standards of
operational performance and corporate
governance.
Our Sustainability Framework, as outlined
on page 17, focusses our ESG
(Environmental, Social, Governance)
activities in the areas we can make the most
meaningful impact – New Zealand’s
economic transformation, digital equity,
and our own sustainable business
practices. To realise these ambitions ESG is
integrated into our ways of operating and
governance, as outlined in this section.
                                               Our Board and Leadership Squad have              Strategy, Te Korowai Tupu, which informs

Spark continues to simplify its portfolio of
products and migrate customers to new
plans and modern technologies. This
objective introduces revenue and customer
experience risks because execution requires
cooperation by a complex set of
stakeholders and retiring legacy products is
challenging. In FY23, Spark’s mature
approach and capability for simplification
enabled it to make good progress towards

processes enable Management to measure
simplification benefits and work through risks
and issues effectively, particularly when
trade-off decisions are required.

                                  In the past year, in partnership with sustainability consultancy thinkstep-anz, we published a report on how digital
                                  technology can enable the transition towards a low-emissions, climate resilient future state. The report analysed the
                                  scale of potential emissions reductions enabled by digital technology, finding 7.2 million tonnes of annual emissions
                                  reductions could be enabled by 2030, which represents 42% of the emissions required for New Zealand to meet
                                  domestic emissions budget over the next decade. See page 48 for a summary. The findings of the report are
                                  enabling us to engage relevant sectors and partners to explore opportunities to accelerate adoption of technology,
                                  and support Government to put in place policies and actions to remove barriers to technology adoption.

                                  This risk rating reflects the ambition of our target, which will require significant effort over the next decade, particularly as
                                  increased investment in infrastructure, including data centres and 5G rollout, is anticipated to increase energy useage.
                                  Our planned actions reduce this risk rating to a ‘low’ rating. See page 44 for information on our SBTi target and plan.

During FY23 Spark sold its subsidiary Connexa. Under the terms of the transaction, Spark has entered into a 15 year lease agreement
(plus rights of renewal) with Connexa to secure access to existing and new towers. Spark also retained a 30% interest in the Connexa
group, through the holding company FrodoCo, which is equity accounted for as an investment in associate. Following Connexa’s
subsequent acquisition of 2degrees’ passive mobile telecommunications tower assets, this retained investment has reduced to 17% and is
still equity accounted for.
The Connexa disposal resulted in a net gain of $583 million as set out below:

Deferred tax assets
Due to the difference between the right–of–use assets and lease liabilities recognised at the date of the transaction, a deferred tax asset of
$126 million was recognised, with a corresponding adjustment (reduction) to tax expense. The balance of the deferred tax asset at 30
June 2023 was $124 million. As noted in the statement of cash flows on page 92, payments for income tax in the year ended 30 June 2023
were $190 million (30 June 2022: $160 million).

Assignment of ground leases
As part of the transaction, Spark assigned its ground leases for the mobile sites to be sold to Connexa. As a result, Spark remeasured these
lease liabilities to the next right of renewal as at this point these leases will be novated to Connexa. This resulted in a $51 million reduction
of the lease liabilities and right–of–use assets which were held for sale. On the sale of Connexa the right–of–use assets were replaced with
finance lease receivables equal to the lease liabilities which were transferred back from held for sale.



     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining control has passed
     Judgement was required in determining whether control passed to Connexa for the assets sold and leased back under a sale
     and leaseback transaction. Key elements considered were the appropriate accounting standard to apply when assessing whether
     control had passed, and determining the unit of account to use to assess the sale and leaseback element.
     Lease liabilities
     See note 4.2 for details of key estimates and assumptions for lease liabilities.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.2 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

Contracts with customers
Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3 Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand–alone selling prices
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand–alone selling price
and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over
time is recognised using the ‘resources consumed by customers’ method or the ‘time–elapsed’ method, as these best depict the transfer of
goods or services to customers.
Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third–party media services and certain cloud, security and service
management contracts. Contracts with a significant financing component include those that have goods that were purchased on interest–
free payment terms of greater than 12 months.
The nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS                                                 TIMING OF SATISFACTION
FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS                                           OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND PAYMENT
Mobile services, broadband services, media services, cloud,             As the service is provided (usually monthly). Generally billed and
security and service management services, managed data services         paid on a monthly basis.
and rental of equipment
Usage, other optional or non–subscription services, and pay–per–        As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid on a monthly
use services                                                            basis.
Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods                  When control is passed to the customer, generally when the
                                                                        customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in packages
                                                                        or on interest–free terms, customers usually pay in equal instalments
                                                                        over 6 to 36 months.
Installation or set–up services (where distinct)                        As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid following the
                                                                        provision of the service.
Network infrastructure                                                  As the goods or services are provided. Generally billed when
                                                                        milestones are completed and revenue recognised when the
                                                                        milestones are completed or once control of goods passes to the
                                                                        customer.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the transaction price
     Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
     entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
     is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.
     We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within
     that product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value
     of money. The ‘expected value’ or ‘most likely’ amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount
     where it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction
     price. In making this determination consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as
     well as factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience with
     similar types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations,
     as well as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions,
     incentives, penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.
     Determining the stand–alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
     Determining the stand–alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
     performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative
     stand–alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand–alone selling price is the
     observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar
     customers. If a stand–alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand–alone selling price taking into account
     reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity–specific factors and the class of customer. In
     determining the stand–alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum
     enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as
     revenue as they are earned.
     Distinct goods and services
     We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
     individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
     items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products
     and services in a bundle based on their stand–alone selling prices.
     Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
     We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the
     methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Refer to page 98 for Spark’s
     accounting policy on timing of satisfaction of performance obligations.

1 Interest was capitalised on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets under development for the year ended 30 June 2023 at an annualised rate of 4.3%
  (30 June 2022: 4.4%).
2 Included within share of associates’ and joint ventures’ net losses is $4 million of transaction costs incurred by Connexa in relation to the 2degrees transaction.
  Therefore this and the net gain on remeasurement of equity accounted investments represent the net gain on dilution of the investment in the Connexa group
  excluded from the adjusted result in note 2.5.

2.5 Non–GAAP measures
Spark uses non–GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark believes that these non–GAAP financial
measures provide useful information to readers to assist in the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of
Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash–based expenses, to
establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for
measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the
telecommunications industry.

Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment income
(EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back finance expense, depreciation and amortisation and income tax expense and subtracting finance
                                                                                                                                                                              2
income and net investment income (which includes Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures, interest
income on loans receivable from associates and joint ventures, gains on remeasurement of equity accounted investments and dividend
income) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with,
those presented in these financial statements.

Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
expenses and impairments) individually greater than $25 million. In the year ended 30 June 2023, the net gain on sale of Connexa of
$583 million together with the subsequent $5 million net gain arising from the dilution of the investment in the Connexa group and the
one off provision of $54 million for Spark Sport were deemed significant items to adjust. There were no significant items to adjust for the
year ended 30 June 2022.

Capital expenditure is the additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding spectrum, goodwill, acquisitions,
assets fully funded by customers or vendors and other non–cash additions that may be required by NZ IFRS, such as decommissioning
costs) and additions to capacity right–of–use assets where such additions are paid up front.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
receivables is estimated to be $75 million (30 June 2022: $75 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value.

Contract assets
Contract assets primarily relate to Spark’s rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting
date. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. The following summarises significant changes
in those balances:

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Contract costs
Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be recovered and are therefore
initially deferred and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer
of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises significant changes in those balances:

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract that meets the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires significant
     judgement. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise the costs
     within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer tenure for
     consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.


Expected credit loss allowance provision
Movements in the loss allowance provision are as follows:

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
loss provision for short–term; trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and other
receivables. The calculation of the allowance provision incorporates Spark's previous collection history and forward–looking information,
such as forecasted economic conditions.
The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                                  CURRENT      ≤ 1 MONTH         > 1 MONTH             TOTAL

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write–off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be
subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
    rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
    impairment calculation based on Spark’s past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward–looking estimates
    at the end of the reporting period. Forward–looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
    unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product in New Zealand.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Finance lease receivables
Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in
Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore
shown as a net finance lease receivable or net lease liability on the statement of financial position.

Spark assigned its ground leases for the mobile site assets sold to Connexa which has resulted in Spark recording finance lease
receivables equal to the lease liabilities for these leases. Spark is unwinding these balances over the remaining term to the next right of
renewal, at which point these will be novated.

In addition, Spark subleases a number of office building floors. Where subleases are for the whole of the remaining non–cancellable term
of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.

1 Included within the discounted balance as at 30 June 2023 are $9 million sublease receivable assets, offset by a $2 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease
  receivable (30 June 2022: $2 million sublease receivable asset, offset by a $2 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease receivable).

The lease with Chorus, where Spark is the lessor, has multiple rights of renewals and the full lease term has been used in the majority of
the calculation of the financial lease receivable at lease inception, as it was likely that because of the specialised nature of the buildings,
the lease would be renewed to the maximum term.

Content rights inventory
Spark previously entered into contracts for the right to stream digital content for sport. These content rights were stated at the lower of
cost and net realisable value, less accumulated amortisation and included prepaid content that was not yet available for broadcast.
The amortisation of content rights was recognised within operating expenses on a straight–line basis over the live events across the
broadcast period. The content rights amortisation charge for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $26 million (30 June 2022: $20 million).
The Spark Sport platform was withdrawn from service on 30 June 2023.

Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited. Inc, and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited (together
‘Southern Cross’) as their carrying values were reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross’ deficits or repay dividends.
For the year ended 30 June 2023 Spark’s share of Southern Cross profits was not recognised because of the existence of historic
cumulative Southern Cross deficits. In the current year Southern Cross’ profit was $34 million (30 June 2022: $39 million).

1 Relates to right-of-use assets which were held for sale as at 30 June 2022, but not sold as part of the Connexa transaction and therefore transferred back to right-of-use
  assets.
2 Remeasurements to property in FY23 and FY22 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases and exiting of space in exchange buildings. The
  reduction in property right-of-use assets for corporate property leases is substantially offset by a reduction in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).

All capacity additions for the year ended 30 June 2023 were fully paid on control being obtained and therefore deemed capital
expenditure as defined and reconciled in note 2.5 (30 June 2022: $8 million of capacity additions with $7 million fully paid and deemed
capital expenditure).
Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $2 million (30 June 2022: $1 million).

                                                                                                                    Spark New Zealand Annual Report 2023




3.4 Right–of–use assets (continued)

    Key estimates and assumptions
    At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the
    contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess
    whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
    • The contract involves the use of an identified asset
    • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use
    • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset.
    At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
    to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
    commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
    adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
    estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is
    located, less any lease incentives received.
    The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
    the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are
    determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for                      3
    impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.



3.5 Leased customer equipment assets
Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of lease arrangements for customer premises equipment. Such
arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a genuine sale if control
of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that a sale does not occur, as
control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor.
Spark as the seller-lessee continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset, which is initially measured at cost. The asset is
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term. Movements in leased customer equipment
assets are summarised below:

3.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Joint arrangement
Spark has entered into a joint arrangement in relation to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic
submarine cable between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2023 the carrying value of Spark’s share of property, plant and
equipment, intangible assets and capacity right-of-use assets in the joint operation was $30 million (30 June 2022: $30 million).



   Key estimates and assumptions
   Spark’s property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets’
   estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires management
   judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
   obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
   The estimated useful lives of Spark’s property, plant and equipment are as follows:
   Telecommunications equipment
   Links and cables                         10 – 50 years
   Network transport                        3 – 15 years
   Mobile radio access network              5 – 25 years
                                                                                                                                                     3
   Customer premises equipment              3 – 5 years
   International cable and satellite        10 – 15 years
   Buildings
   Buildings                                15 – 53 years
   Furniture and fittings                   3 – 15 years
   Air conditioning                         8 – 20 years
   Power systems                            3 – 25 years
   Batteries                                5 – 15 years
   Other
   Motor vehicles                           3 – 10 years
   Computer equipment                       2 – 8 years
   Internal IT system assets                3 – 15 years
   The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
   conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
   flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
   include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
   for valuing future cash flows.

1 Total software capitalised in the year ended 30 June 2023 includes $69 million (30 June 2022: $59 million) of internally generated assets. Other software capitalised in
  the year includes software licences and externally supplied labour.




     Key estimates and assumptions
     Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment
     annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement, including assessing the
     expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark
     ceasing to use it.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark intangible assets are as follows:
     Spectrum licences                                                2 – 21 years
     Software		                                                       2 – 12 years

     Other intangible assets                                          2 – 100 years

During the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of the carrying value of
goodwill. Headroom currently exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.
                                                                                                                                                         3
    Key estimates and assumptions
    Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment using a value-in-use model, which estimates the future cash flows, based on the
    FY24 Board-approved business plan, applied to the next three years, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital
    expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU
    performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include
    revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future
    technology paths.
    Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 11.7% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2023
    (30 June 2022: 10.6%).

1 Relates to lease liabilities which were held for sale as at 30 June 2022, but either assigned or, not sold as part of the Connexa transaction and therefore transferred back
  to lease liabilities.
2 Remeasurements to property in FY23 and FY22 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases. The reduction in lease liabilities is substantially offset by
  a reduction in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4).
3 Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark’s
  option, including leases committed to that have not yet commenced.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Liabilities and equity


4.2 Lease liabilities (continued)

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
     the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
     rate cannot be readily determined, Spark’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as
     the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
     Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
     • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments
     • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
       commencement date
     • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee
     • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise
     • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.
     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
     future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark’s estimate of the amount expected
     to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or
     extension option.
     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
     asset or it is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
     Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of
     12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within
     operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

4.3 Debt
Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and
measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes
attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Liabilities and equity


4.3 Debt (continued)
None of Spark’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark’s debt,
however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default
over Spark’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022.
The fair value of long-term debt, including long-term debt due within one year, based on market observable prices, was $973 million
compared to a carrying value of $962 million as at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: fair value of $1,359 million compared to a carrying value
of $1,347 million).

4.4 Capital risk management
Spark manages its capital considering shareholders’ interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board is
committed to the Company maintaining an investment grade rating and its capital management policies are designed to ensure this
objective is met. As part of this commitment, and in line with credit rating metrics, Spark currently manages its debt levels to ensure that
the ratio of adjusted net debt at hedged rates (being inclusive of associated derivatives and leases) to EBITDAI does not exceed 1.7 times
on a long-run basis.
As at 30 June 2023 the Company’s Standard and Poor’s credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was, respectively, A- and A-2 with
outlook stable (30 June 2022: same).

Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to
arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge
adjustments and any unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.

1 Net debt at hedged rates is the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity and includes an adjustment to state the principal of foreign currency medium term
  notes at the hedged currency rate.
2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have
  no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

    Events after balance date
    On 17 August 2023 the Board approved the payment of a second-half ordinary dividend of 13.5 cents per share or approximately
    $249 million. This ordinary dividend will be 100% imputed. In addition, supplementary dividends totalling approximately $26

1 Spark’s American Depositary Shares, each representing five ordinary Spark shares and evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), are traded over-the-
  counter in the United States. This is a Level 1 ADR programme that is sponsored by Bank of New York Mellon. For H2 FY23 these are based on the exchange rate at
  10 August 2023 of NZ$1 to US$0.6022 and a ratio of five ordinary shares per one American Depositary Share. The actual exchange rate used for conversion is
  determined in the week prior to payment when the Bank of New York Mellon performs the physical currency conversion.
2 Supplementary dividends are paid to non-resident shareholders.



     Dividend Reinvestment Plan
     The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders can elect to receive dividends in additional shares. For
     the year ended 30 June 2023 no shares were issued (30 June 2022: $18 million were issued) in lieu of dividends. Shares issued in
     lieu of dividends are excluded from dividends paid in the statement of cash flows.
     The dividend reinvestment plan has been suspended for the FY23 dividends and for the foreseeable future.

Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and foreign
exchange prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other than quoted
prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022 no derivative financial
assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting of any derivative
financial instruments is $13 million (30 June 2022: $8 million), which if applied would result in a reduction of derivative assets and
derivative liabilities.

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
Derivatives are designated:
• Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt
• Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions
• Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in
  cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective                                    5
cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate debt
and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency fixed-rate debt into variable rate debt.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

Included within the closing balance at 30 June 2023 is $4 million relating to the cost of hedging reserve (30 June 2022: $3 million). The
movement in the hedge reserves includes $8 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $2 million associated deferred
tax and $3 million for forward foreign exchange contracts (30 June 2022: $98 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less
$27 million associated deferred tax).

Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
year ended 30 June 2023 there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2022: no material
ineffectiveness) and as a result no material changes have been recognised in profit and loss.

Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark’s risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are
excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
of the debt.
The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRSs are recognised in
other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to
profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

Currency risk from capital and operational expenditure in foreign
currencies (and related trade payables) has been substantially
hedged by entering into forward exchange contracts.
Sensitivity to foreign currency movements
As at 30 June 2023 a movement of 10% in the New Zealand dollar
would (after hedging) impact the statement of profit or loss by less
than $1 million (30 June 2022: less than $1 million) and the
statement of changes in equity by less than $11 million (30 June
2022: less than $12 million). This analysis assumes a movement in
the New Zealand dollar across all currencies and only includes the

party that has a strong financial position with no past due amounts.
Spark manages its exposure using a credit policy that includes
limits on exposures with significant counterparties that have been
set and approved by the Board and are monitored on a regular
basis. Spark places its cash and derivative financial instruments
with high-credit quality financial institutions and does not have
significant concentration of risk with any single financial institution.
Spark has significant shareholder loans and finance lease
receivables which are deemed low credit risk. Concentration of
credit risk for trade and other receivables is limited because of
Spark’s large customer base.
Spark has certain derivatives and debt arrangements that are
subject to bilateral credit support agreements that require Spark or
its counterparties to post collateral funds to support the value of
certain derivatives subject to certain agreed threshold amounts. As
at 30 June 2023 no collateral was posted (30 June 2022: nil).
Letters of credit and guarantees may be held over some receivable
amounts. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the
maximum credit exposure.

1 This includes $26 million for the costs associated with assets disposed of in the sale of Connexa, $2 million for the unwind of the deferred tax asset explained below for
  the Connexa transaction and $2 million of current tax for the Spark Sport provision.
2 Due to the difference between the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognised at the date of the sale of Connexa, a deferred tax asset of $126 million was
  recognised, with a corresponding adjustment (reduction) to tax expense. The balance of the deferred tax asset at 30 June 2023 was $124 million. The Spark Sport
  provision had a deferred tax impact at 30 June 2023 of $12 million. The current tax impact of adjusting items of $31 million together with the deferred income tax
  impact of $137 million is $168 million (see note 2.5). The total tax expense on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis for FY23 was $185 million.

1 Amounts relating to the current period include timing differences for the Connexa lease and the Spark Sport provision.
2 Adjustments in respect of prior periods reflect changes in the prior year tax balances used for financial reporting and tax return completion. In the current year these
  primarily relate to reclassifications between categories to align with the current year's presentation.

Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AU$461 million at
30 June 2023 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2022: AU$461 million). These losses and temporary
differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the
production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority
requirements.
Spark has a negative 32 million imputation credit account balance as at 30 June 2023 due to the timing of dividend and tax payments
(30 June 2022: negative 16 million). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Other information


6.2 Employee share schemes
Spark operates share-based compensation plans that are equity settled as outlined below.

Share option scheme
From September 2019, members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders have been granted options
under the new Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme. Under the scheme participants are granted options at the start of the three-
year vesting period. The number of options granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark
New Zealand shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment,
at vesting each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark
employment) then the options simply lapse, with exceptions for redundancy, death and disablement. Spark enables participants to meet
tax obligations through PAYE by authorising the sale of a sufficient number of shares on their behalf.
Vesting of the LTI grants are contingent on: participants’ continued employment with Spark for three years from grant date (subject to
exceptions); and the Company achieving the specified performance hurdles. The performance hurdle targets are set annually and for
grants issued in 2019, 2020, 2021 this was the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. For grants issued in 2022, 75%
of the allocated shares will vest based on the performance hurdle target of the Company’s cost of equity plus 1.5% compounding annually
and 25% will vest based on performance against environmental and diversity targets. Options with an intrinsic value of $15 million
(30 June 2022: $14 million) remain outstanding at 30 June 2023 and have a weighted average remaining life of 1.3 years (30 June 2022:
1.3 years).

Historic restricted share schemes (RSS)
A restricted share scheme was initially introduced for selected employees in September 2001. For new allocations after August 2015
these were replaced by two new restricted share schemes
• Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme
• Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long-Term Incentive Scheme.
The Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme was for the senior leaders including the Leadership Squad and delivered one
scheme with the same set of rules under one long-term incentive, with a performance hurdle in place. The Spark New Zealand Managing
Director Long-Term Incentive Scheme related to the previous Managing Director, Simon Moutter.
Under these restricted share schemes, ordinary shares in the Company were issued to Spark Trustee Limited. Participants purchase shares
from Spark Trustee Limited with funds lent to them by the Company and which were held on their behalf by Spark Trustee Limited. If the
individual was still employed by Spark at the end of the vesting period (generally three years) and applicable performance hurdles were
met, the employee was provided a cash bonus, which was used to repay the loan and the shares were then transferred to the individual.
The target for this hurdle was the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. The last year when RSS shares were granted
was FY19 therefore FY22 was the last year where RSS shares vested.
Information regarding shares and options awarded under these schemes is as follows:

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments is recognised as an expense, with a
corresponding entry in equity. The total charge recognised for this scheme for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $1.4 million (30 June
2022: $1.3 million). The expense relating to the restricted share schemes for the year ended 30 June 2022 was $0.1 million. As at 30 June
2023, $2.1 million of share scheme awards remain unvested and not expensed (30 June 2022: $1.6 million). This expense, measured at its
fair value based on a valuation model, will be recognised over the remaining vesting period of the awards. On 19 September 2022, the
options granted in September 2019 vested, the prevailing market rate at this date was $5.06 per share.

Independent auditor’s report




Independent auditor’s report
To the Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Opinion                        We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries (the
                               ‘Group’), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2023, and the
                               consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity
                               and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
                               including a summary of significant accounting policies.
                               In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 89 to 135, present fairly, in all
                               material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2023, and its consolidated
                               financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to
                               International Financial Reporting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’) and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’).

Basis for opinion              We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and International
                               Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those standards are further
                               described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of
                               our report.
                               We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
                               opinion.
                               We are independent of the Company in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International
                               Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand)

                               Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International
                               Independence Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
                               requirements.
                               Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to regulatory audit, other
                               assurance related services (such as trustee reporting) and non-assurance services provided to the Corporate
                               Taxpayers Group, of which the Group is a member. These services have not impaired our independence as
                               auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a sister and brother-in-law that are
                               partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the provision of any services to the Group and
                               its subsidiaries and this matter has not impacted our independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm
                               deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the
                               Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in the Group.

Audit materiality              We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements of the
                               Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
                               knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also
                               assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or
                               influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the
                               scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Key audit matters              Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
                               of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
                               our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
                               not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

                             Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary but ideally would increase
this shareholding to 100% of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any Long-Term Incentive schemes. To fulfil this expectation
shares are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019. As at 30 June 2023 the CEO held 311,830 ordinary shares, which exceeds
the ideal shareholding requirement to hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 100% of the CEO’s base salary.

Other directors’ fees
Mr Richard Quince received a director’s fee of NZ$10,000 (excluding GST) for acting as a director of Teleco Insurance (NZ) Limited.

Director independence
As part of the formal independence assessment, the Board considered all business relationships and close personal ties between Spark and
any companies of which a non-executive director is an employee, director or substantial shareholder (if any). The Board has determined, based
on information provided by directors regarding their interests, that at 30 June 2023 Ms Barrass, Mr Bray, Ms Broadbent, Mr MacLeod, Mr Sitch
and Ms Smyth were independent.
The Board determined that Ms Hodson was not independent due to her position as CEO, and Mr Havercroft was not independent due to his
recent relationships with Spark, which have now ceased.
The criteria for determining director independence and conflict of interest may be found in the Board Charter at: www.sparknz.co.nz/about/

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or,
in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive
director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as
at the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased
within a three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was within a three-year
period from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the
aggregate sale price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

150 Hello tomorrow
                                                                                                                                                        Spark New Zealand Annual Report 2023




Sustainability appendix
As an integrated report we have included disclosure on our sustainability performance throughout this report. Pages 6 and 7 detail our
integrated reporting value creation model, aligned to the ‘capitals’ which each have a dedicated section in the report.
This report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core Option. It also
incorporates climate risk disclosure aligned to the incoming New Zealand Climate Related Disclosure reporting recommendations aligned to
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.
We publish a summary of our approach to sustainability at Spark on our website: https://www.sparknz.co.nz/sustainability/

Materiality
To prioritise Spark’s reporting on sustainability topics we follow the GRI materiality principle (set out in GRI 101) to identify and prioritise topics
which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social, or economic impact.
We also consider the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR> Framework, considering whether a matter could
substantively affect Spark's ability to create value in the short, medium, or long term.
Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of stakeholder feedback, review of industry peers, and interviews with external
stakeholders. Internally we consult with a range of employees, including members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk,
legal & regulatory, and people and culture teams, to determine Spark’s view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria.
We have updated our materiality matrix for FY23. This includes incorporating AI alongside trust in privacy and security, merging network
resilience and climate adaptation into a single topic, increasing the importance of disaster crisis response and the role of digital technology in
addressing sustainability challenges.

Stakeholder engagement
Spark engages with a broad range of stakeholders as detailed in the table below. We have also engaged a small number of stakeholders
specifically for the purposes of developing and improving our non-financial reporting and as part of our reporting materiality process. In
selecting the stakeholders we engage with, we are guided by the definition set out in GRI 101: which is, “entities or individuals that can
reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by the organisation’s activities, products or services; or whose actions can reasonably be
expected to affect the ability of the organisation to implement its strategies or achieve its objectives.”

Millimeter waves    millimeter waves, also known as extremely high frequency (EHF), is a band of radio frequencies that has
                    wavelengths between 1 mm and 10 mm. These frequencies can carry massive amounts of data at very high
                    speeds. That makes them ideal for accommodating the massive increase in data demanded from new 5G use
                    cases such as augmented/virtual reality, cloud gaming, video analytics and other cloud-compute capabilities.
Multi-access edge   extends the capabilities of cloud computing by bringing it to the ‘edge’ of the network. While traditional cloud
computing (MAEC)    computing occurs on remote servers that are situated far from the customer and device, MAEC allows this
                    processing to take place much closer to the end customer – meaning data has to travel a shorter distance,
                    decreasing latency, and the amount of data sent across the network can be reduced, reducing congestion and
                    delivering a better customer experience.
Network slicing     allows the operator to ‘slice’ its network to support different types of services through each ‘slice’. Multiple slices
                    can be tuned independently to meet different quality of service parameters. For example, one slice may simply
                    need a standard speed connection to enable office email, another might be tuned to support very low data
                    Internet of Things devices, while another slice may need high reliability and ultra-low latency to support robotics.
