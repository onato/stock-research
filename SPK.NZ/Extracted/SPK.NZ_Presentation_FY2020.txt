Our new context
COVID-19 impacts will materialise further in FY21
         • IMF has predicted the largest global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the
           1930s, this will have flow on impacts for New Zealand given our dependence on global trade and
           tourism.
         • Tourism unlikely to return to historical levels for some time.

         • New Zealand will enter a recession and unemployment is forecast to increase.
         • The impact on small-medium businesses, many of whom are our customers, may be significant.
         • This creates an environment of volatility and uncertainty, which has been further exacerbated by
           the resurgence of COVID-19.

         • Billing collection risk as customers experience financial hardship and wage subsidies roll off.
         • Mobile market growth likely to be slower, particularly roaming and mobile handsets.
         • IaaS and SaaS(1) likely to benefit, but potentially some offset in other IT outsourcing programmes.
         • Greater confidence to increase caps and drive wireless broadband uptake after strong network
           performance during lockdown.
         • Cost reduction programs require acceleration in FY21.
         • 5G rollout and sustainability focus on digital divide even more critical to support New Zealand’s
           recovery.
