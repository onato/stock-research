Overall Performance
Key Result Themes
Financial and market share results are on plan, with focus on customer experience and operational efficiency driving performance in a challenging market.

Implementation of Agile operating model completed across the business. Already delivering expected benefits in customer centricity, speed to market,
productivity and employee engagement.

Focus on wireless maintained, albeit market forces seeing slowing usage revenue growth - somewhat compensated by margin improvement. Mobile market
shifting focus to customer value and profitability with some changes in handset buyer behaviour also evident.

Expect 5G to be a driver of innovation for both our industry and the New Zealand economy. In trial/demo phase now and working towards commercial launch
by July 2020 at the latest.

Pricing initiatives influencing positive margin performance in broadband with copper pricing increased and upfront contract incentives being heavily reduced.
Wireless broadband uptake continuing to grow with consequent customer experience and margin benefits flowing.

Cloud, security and service management revenue growth maintained with continuing strong customer demand; albeit moderated by rising competitive intensity
from local and global providers.

Decision by Southern Cross to withhold dividends pending investment in potential build of Southern Cross Next cable - impacting short term earnings in favour of
long-term investment returns.

Spark Sport platform build on track, with beta version to launch in March 2019. Spark Sport subscription pricing of $19.99 per month announced today.
Confidently progressing with all preparations needed for successful delivery of the Rugby World Cup in September 2019 (RWC 2019).

Spark’s H1 FY19 result is reported in accordance with previously announced changes to Spark’s disclosure of long-term investments and Spark’s recent adoption
of NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers and NZ IFRS 16 Leases. While these changes have no impact on cash flow they do alter the presentation of
Spark’s financial results – primarily due to:
•     Dividend income from Southern Cross (and other investments) together with Sparks share of associates’ and joint ventures’ net profit and losses being
      included in a new ‘net investment income’ category outside of EBITDAI;
•     A shift from operating revenue to interest income to reflect the credit risk on interest free mobile device sales;
•     A reduction in operating revenues and operating costs to reflect the netting-off of Spotify and Netflix expenses that are now treated as agency
      arrangements; and
•     A change in the classification of operating lease costs to depreciation and interest expenses.
The impact of these changes on FY17 and FY18 financial statements are summarised in Appendix 1(1).

Key Areas of Focus                                                                                                                  ~$62m
Further progress made against three key areas of focus

  Emphasis on Wireless
                                                                                                                           Wireless Broadband Migration
• Solid progress towards being mostly ex copper by 2020 with 58% of broadband customers now on new broadband                annualised gross reduction in
   technologies – up 13pp in the last twelve months                                                                                 access costs
• Customer uptake of wireless broadband continues; with base increasing by a further 13k connections in H1. 18% of
   broadband customers (129k) now benefiting from wireless broadband; further demonstrating the potential for
   expanded speed and capacity of 4.5G and 5G networks to satisfy customer demand
• Adoption of ‘Unlimited’ mobile plans, including shareable plan launched during H1 FY19, demonstrates customer
   demand for price certainty. Number of customers on an ‘Unlimited’ mobile plan doubled during H1, fuelling a 2pp
   YoY increase in the proportion of consumer pay monthly customers on a $55+ plan                                                  ~$110m


 Better serving price sensitive customers
                                                                                                                              Quantum Programme
• Skinny’s lower priced high data-cap mobile plans continue to perform well; contributing to significant ARPU growth of      annualised net reduction in
  10% YoY and a 16% YoY increase in Skinny customers on recurring plans                                                             labour costs
• Skinny sub-brand secured connection growth in a hyper-competitive broadband market
• Introduction of new SD-WAN(3) products providing lower priced connectivity solutions to business customers; associated
  margin supported by a lower cost to serve via improved customer experience and self-service options
                                                                                                                                     40.9%

Quantum programme(4) of simplification, digitisation and automation has delivered a transformative improvement in
service experience and productivity:
• Met H1 target for annualised net labour costs – reducing a further ~$30m to ~$470m during the half. Total Quantum          Market Share of Broadband
   implementation costs of $57m have now delivered net annualised benefits of ~$110m.                                            Connections (1) (2)

Overall Performance
Financial Summary
EBITDAI growth underpinned by margin expansion and Quantum programme
benefits reducing cost base
EBITDAI of $489m up $33m (7.2%) on reported prior year EBITDAI and up $20m (4.3%) on adjusted prior year EBITDAI. Underpinned                                                            ($7m)
by gross margin growth and a $40m (3.1%) reduction in total operating expenses - including a further $26m (9.4%) YoY reduction in
net labour costs delivered via Spark’s Quantum programme – partially offset by a $5m fair value adjustment of Spark’s investment in a                                                    (0.4%)
global IoT start-up. Annualised net labour costs reduced to ~$470m during H1 FY19, down ~$110m since June 2017.

Gross margin up $8m (0.8%) on prior year despite reported revenue decline of $7m (0.4%); due to improved gross margin                                                                    Revenue
percentages across mobile, broadband and managed data and networks.                                                                                                                     movement
• Revenue growth totalling $25m across mobile (up 1.5%) and cloud, security and service management (up 8.9%) and a return to                                                            vs. H1 FY18
   growth in a challenging broadband market (up 3.9%) partially offsetting continued declines in voice, managed data and networks
   revenues; down $51m in total.
• Mobile, cloud, security and service management now account for 56% of Spark’s gross margin; up 3pp since H1 FY18.

NPAT down $9m or (5.6%) versus reported prior year NPAT and down $18m or (10.5%) on adjusted prior year NPAT; with EBITDAI
growth more than offset by:                                                                                                                                                              $33m
• $28m decline in Southern Cross dividend (no dividend was declared in H1 FY19) and associated increase in Spark’s effective income                                                       7.2%
   tax rate(1);
• Depreciation and amortisation up $8m (3.4%) due to shortened asset life of a single software solution that Spark is migrating away
   from; and                                                                                                                                                                             EBITDAI
• Increase in finance expenses of $3m (8.1%) on higher average net debt.                                                                                                                movement
                                                                                                                                                                                       vs. reported H1
Net debt increased by $132m during H1 FY19 primarily due to top-up of dividends and device receivable growth. Rate of net debt                                                               FY18
growth is expected to slow significantly during H2 FY19.
• H1 FY19 capital expenditure in line with prior year; on track to remain within targeted capital expenditure of 11%-12% of
   operating revenues for FY19.
• Cash conversion ratio(2) of 92% consistent with expected full year conversion ratio of 95%; underlying improvements in cash
   conversion partially offset by timing of Quantum implementation costs and slower than expected sell-through of higher end mobile
   device inventory.                                                                                                                                                                     ($9m)
H1 FY19 total dividend per share of 12.5c will be made up of a 75% imputed ordinary dividend per share of 11.0c and a 75%
                                                                                                                                                                                         (5.6%)
imputed special dividend per share of 1.5c. Reported net debt(3) to EBITDA ratio of ~1.2x is consistent with our ongoing commitment to
maintaining an A- S&P credit rating.

(1)New Zealand tax rules treat Spark’s 50% share of SX earnings as taxable and any SX dividend income as tax exempt. With no SX dividends paid in the current period Sparks H1 FY19

tax expense (and effective tax rate) are higher as tax will still be paid on Spark’s share of underlying earnings.
(2) Calculated as net cash flow from operations (excluding tax, dividend receipts and interest) divided by EBITDAI (excluding net gains from divestments and impairments)

                                                                                                                                                                                                         4

   Cloud, security and service management
   Revenue growth fuelled by continued adoption of cloud services; further expansion in gross
   margin reflecting service management efficiency gains
   Topline revenue growth of $16m (8.9%) however momentum has
   slowed. Ongoing demand and volume growth being partially offset by:
   • Emerging price pressure on renewals driven by increased competition
                                                                                                                                        Cloud, security and service management revenue
      from local and global providers;
   • Customer transitions proving to be slower and more complex as we
      move into ‘middle-market’ segment of the adoption curve for cloud;                                                                                                        +8.9%

   Fundamental drivers of revenue growth continue to be:                                                                                            166

   • Long pipeline of organic sales opportunities due to relatively low
      market penetration; and
   • Global trends favouring cloud solutions

"Previously we had to liaise with many different people across different Spark teams, and we had concerns there wasn't the focus or urgency given to key
projects. Today we are dealing with one multi-disciplinary team and we are making important decisions together, collaborating in real time, and resolving
issues as they arise. There is full transparency and we now see this as one of our most positive and productive partnerships."

Appendix 3
Cash flow
Following adoption of new accounting standards and changes to the disclosure of
Spark’s long-term investments Spark has introduced a new measure to better
communicate cash flow
When first announced, this measure specifically                                                                                            H1          H2           H1      H2      H1

                                                                                                                                           $m          $m           $m      $m      $m
However it has since been refined to also
exclude:                                                                          Net cash flows from operations                          320          438         426     394     393

The refined measure will be identified as                                         equipment assets
                                                                                                                                            (7)             (8)     (8)     (9)     (8)

To enable reconciliation of this measure to                                       excluding

been created within Spark’s cash flow statement                                   (Increase)/decrease in working
