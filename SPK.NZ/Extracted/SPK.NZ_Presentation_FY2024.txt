Performance below aspiration, growth targeted in FY25 as SPK-26 Operate Programme accelerates

  FY24 growth offset by subdued demand in some markets, with cost interventions to be realised in FY25
  • Mobile service revenues surpassed $1 billion for the first time and IT products, data centres, and high-tech continued to grow
  • Economic conditions impacted demand in IT services, intensified competition in business mobile, and led to lower mobile device and accessories sales
  • FY24 revenue of $3,861m declined 1.2% on an adjusted(1) basis and 14.0% on a reported basis, as subdued demand offset growth
  • SPK-26 Operate Programme accelerated in H2 but could not adapt the cost base to changing demand quickly enough, with benefits to be largely realised in FY25
  • As a result, EBITDAI of $1,163m declined 2.5% on an adjusted(1) basis and 32.5% on a reported basis
  • Reported NPAT declined 72.2% to $316 million due to cycling the TowerCo and Spark Sport transactions, lower EBITDAI, higher finance expenses and depreciation, and a
    one-off $26 million non-cash tax adjustment relating to Government policy changes(2). Adjusted NPAT, excluding one-offs in both years, declined 21.0% to $342 million
  • Free cash flow declined 32.5% to $330m due to lower EBITDAI and higher interest, lease costs, and non-cash earnings, contributing to higher net debt
  • Customer satisfaction up 7 points, employee engagement remains strong, and top quartile sustainability benchmarking maintained against local and global peers
  • Board declared a total FY24 dividend of 27.5 cps (100% imputed), with Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) to be reinstated for the H2 FY24 dividend(3)

  Business fundamentals remain strong, with clear plan to return to growth in FY25
  1. Maintain leadership in growing mobile market through product innovation, customer demand for data, and annual price reviews
  2. Scale data centre growth opportunity as AI and cloud drive significant increases in capacity demand
  3. SPK-26 Operate Programme to deliver further material labour and opex cost reductions
  4. Remain committed to financial strength and flexibility and bringing net debt back to ~1.7x EBITDAI in line with A- credit rating
  5. FY25 Guidance of $1,165m-$1,220m EBITDAI, lower capex of ~$460m-$480m, and a dividend of 27.5 cps (75% imputed)
