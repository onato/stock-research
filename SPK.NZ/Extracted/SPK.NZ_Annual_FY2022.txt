Re-imagining
a future that all
New Zealanders
can share.
We’re on track to a re-imagined future that all
New Zealanders can share.

The challenges of the pandemic, and our urgent
need to transition to a low-carbon economy, have
brought into sharp focus the role technology must
play in enabling this change.

We’re continuing to simplify ourselves, and hone our
understanding of New Zealanders through data, to
serve Kiwis better. And we’re building the critical
infrastructure and introducing new technologies that
will enable and embolden New Zealanders to go
after what inspires them, in life and in business.

As Aotearoa rapidly digitises, we are acutely aware of
the responsibility we hold to help all New Zealanders
thrive in a digital world – no matter who they are or
where they’re from.

We are here to help New Zealanders build the
tomorrow they want.

About this report

•                     This is an integrated report to share our financial, social,
                      environmental and economic performance. To inform our                                                                                                       Key dates
                      approach we’ve applied the International <IR> Framework                                                                                                     Annual Meeting                          04 November 2022
                      which considers the creation of value over the short, medium,
                                                                                                                                                                                  FY23 half-year results announcement     22 February 2023
                      and long term, thinking holistically about the resources and
                      relationships the organisation uses or affects, and the                                                                                                     FY23 year-end results announcement      18 August 2023
                      dependencies and trade-offs between them as value is created.
•                     At the heart of this approach is the <IR> value creation model
                      (laid out on page 8), which details the ‘capitals’ we draw upon,
                      our strategy and business model, and the outputs and
                      outcomes we deliver. We have a section of the report dedicated
                      to each of these capitals. Our detailed financial report is
                      covered in pages 78 – 123.
•                     In preparing the report we also use the Global Reporting
                      Initiative (GRI) standards, the most widely used global
                      sustainability reporting standard. This requires us to apply a
                      materiality lens to identify and report against the sustainability
                      issues most important to our business and our stakeholders.
                      We have a dedicated sustainability appendix at the back of the
                      report that includes our materiality matrix and our GRI index
                      that directs to where we have covered specific sustainability
                      topics in the report and elsewhere. See pages 139 – 146.
•                     This Annual Report is published alongside our FY22

Te Korowai Tupu
                       Our Māori strategy, Te Korowai Tupu
                       (the cloak of growth), is about finding
                       the shared space between te ao Māori
                       and the corporate world. In this spirit
                       of partnership, threads of Te Korowai
                       Tupu have been woven throughout
                       this report and highlighted using the
                       Kora Aotearoa logo.

                                Spark New Zealand Annual Report 2022




Ko Te Pae Anamata, Whakamaua
Grasp the future horizon
On the front page of this report you will see the
words, Hello Tomorrow, and the accompanying
Te Reo Māori kupu, Ko Te Pae Anamata,
Whakamaua. Translated back into English, this
means Grasp the future horizon.
When considering Hello Tomorrow from a te ao
Māori perspective, we started at whakapapa (lineage)
– knowing who we are and where we come from.
Our whakapapa allows us to see the past as
mātauranga (wisdom) we have inherited as
mokopuna (descendants) ourselves. With this
understanding, the decisions we make in the present
benefit from the ancestral knowledge of our past.
Embraced by Te Korowai Tupu, we aspire for
Spark to create a meaningful impact on Te Ao
Kikokiko (the ever-changing world around us) so
that future generations can continue to grow and
thrive in a digital world.
We know that pursuing future horizons was
the motivation of our Tīpuna (ancestors) when
they discovered Aotearoa. Grounded in this
intergenerational aspiration, we welcome the
opportunities of what is yet to be known, yet
to be done, and yet to be learned.
Ko te pae anamata, Whakamaua – grasp the
future horizon.

     growth reflecting a shift away from private cloud to

customers and the Office of the Privacy
Commissioner of unauthorised access to
some MySpark and Xtra Mail accounts,
which occurred because Spark customers
had used their Spark or Xtra Mail login
credentials (email and password
combination) on other platforms – and
when these other platforms were
compromised, their credentials were
harvested. Unfortunately, these credential
harvesting attacks are commonplace on
digital platforms but we continue to
educate our customers around best

protect against this scenario.

ensuring the rural sector can remain
competitive internationally.
During the financial year RCG has built
more than 120 sites, bringing the total build
to more than 360 sites across Aotearoa.
The programme delivers 4G wireless
broadband coverage to ~30,200
homes and businesses and provides
mobile coverage to over 830 kilometres
of state highways.
The RCG model has attracted global
interest and is believed to be one of the
first in the world where three mobile
operators share spectrum, radio, and
backhaul. It uses a 4G Multi Operator Core
Network to deliver broadband and mobile
services, which helps make the most
efficient use of the radio spectrum available,
and lower network integration costs.
Outside our participation in RCG, we
continued to expand our own mobile
network into smaller towns and provincial
areas, building new sites in the Coromandel
and Hastings during the year, while
upgrading our existing 4G network to
ensure we can continue to provide the
capacity our customers need.
These capacity investments in our rural
mobile sites have enabled us to extend
the availability of our unlimited broadband
plans to an additional 30,000 rural
households during the year, reducing costs
for customers in certain areas by up to
$71 a month. Customers in eligible areas
can move to our Everyday Wireless plan
which is $60 per month for unlimited data.

Pride
Spark has been a long-time supporter
of the Rainbow Community, and in March
we once again engaged in the Auckland
Pride and Spark Empowerment Initiative.
In June we supported International Pride
Month through a series of events at our
corporate offices across the country.
We are committed to our continued
support of OUTLine NZ, a national charity
that offers a free support line for members
of the LGBTQIA+ community and family
and friends. In FY22, this included the
co-creation and launch of the Beyond
Binary Code (see page 22 for more
information) and our ongoing support with
equipment, software and tech support to
keep OUTLine’s support line and online
chat support service running.
Alongside the Beyond Binary Code launch,
we launched a training module to help our
people to understand key concepts of
diversity, equity, and inclusion with a focus
on gender, sexuality, and gender fluidity.
The training module includes general
definitions and distinctions as well as basic
information on how to support an inclusive
workplace that respects and values those
from diverse gender backgrounds.
OUTLine NZ has also been included in
our Mahi Tahi suite of specialist support
offerings, providing our people with
specialist rainbow affirming counselling.

Spark implemented Contribution Models
when it flipped to agile, which are
designed to ensure equal pay for work
of equal value within each chapter of the
business and pay gaps within each ‘step’
of the model are reviewed annually as part
of our salary review process. Our ambition
is to reduce our overall median gender pay
gap – which is a measure that compares the
pay of all female employees to that of all
male employees, and therefore reflects
differences in the occupations that men
and women do within Spark. It is not to be
confused with a measure of equal pay for
equal work. Committing to reducing our
median gender pay gap means we must
focus not only on getting more women into
our business, but also ensuring that they
are proportionately represented in higher
paid roles.
Our median gender pay gap, which
presents the difference between the
median pay of our female and male
employees as a percentage of male pay,
has reduced from 28% in FY21 to 24%.
While our FY23 target is focussed on the
gap between median rates of pay, we also

Parental leave
Spark provides a parental leave policy for eligible employees, regardless of gender, sexuality, age or whether the employee is giving birth or
adopting a child. If an employee has been employed by Spark for a minimum of 12 months, then Spark will top up the Government’s parental
leave payments, so the employee receives 80% of their salary for 26 weeks. As a guaranteed minimum Spark ensures that the total amount
someone receives, less any Government paid primary carer's payments, will not be less than the equivalent of six weeks of ordinary salary.
Eligibility for Parental Leave is in accordance with Government legislation.

Spark’s Corporate Fleet Journey
Since 2019, we have been actively changing how our Fleet looks, by choosing
vehicles that reflect the Spark sustainability story. We've moved away from a
hybrid model of part owned/part leased, to a full leased and managed fleet,
with a mix of pool (shared) and assigned vehicles.

Remuneration components
Short-term Incentive Scheme
The CEO is eligible for an annual cash-based short-term incentive, subject to the achievement
of specific performance objectives set by the Board based on Spark’s strategy and business
plan for the respective financial year. These objectives will be a combination of financial and
non-financial measures. This is covered in more detail in the earlier STI scheme section.
The Board assesses the CEO’s performance at the end of the financial year to determine the
actual payment value of her short-term incentive, which is in the range of 0% to 200% of her
target value.
The FY22 Group performance outcome, as approved by the Board and applicable to the
CEO, is summarised as follows:

1.4 Impact of change in accounting policy
Spark has changed its accounting policy in relation to SaaS arrangements in response to the IFRIC agenda decision that typically SaaS
                                                                                                                                                                                   1
arrangements do not give rise to an asset, and configuration and customisation costs will likely need to be expensed. This has reduced
EBITDAI, net earnings before tax, and total assets due to such expenses now being recognised as the services are received rather than
capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over the software asset’s useful life. There has been no net impact on Spark’s statement of
cash flows. However, it has resulted in the reclassification of the applicable costs incurred from investing to operating activities.
The impact of the change in Spark’s accounting policy in relation to SaaS arrangements in response to the IFRIC agenda decision on the
comparative financials statements is as follows:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: General information


1.5 Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale
During FY22 Spark commenced a process to transfer its passive mobile tower assets into a separate subsidiary, TowerCo, and to introduce
third-party capital into TowerCo. As at 30 June 2022 the assets and liabilities associated with TowerCo have been classified as held for sale.
On 12 July 2022 Spark confirmed the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board will acquire a 70% interest in the TowerCo business, with
completion anticipated to occur in the first half of FY23, conditional on Overseas Investment Office approval. The transaction will deliver
proceeds of approximately $900 million and values the business at $1.175 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, Spark has entered into a 15-year agreement with TowerCo (plus rights of renewal) to secure access to existing
and new towers, with a build commitment of 670 sites over the next 10 years.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale are as follows:

                                                                                                                                            2022

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.2 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

Contracts with customers
Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling prices
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price
and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over
time is recognised using the ‘resources consumed by customers’ method or the ‘time-elapsed method’, as these best depict the transfer of
goods or services to customers.
Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service
management contracts. Contracts with a significant financing component include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-
free payment terms of greater than 12 months.
The nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS                                                 TIMING OF SATISFACTION
FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS                                           OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND PAYMENT
Mobile services, broadband services, media services, cloud,             As the service is provided (usually monthly). Generally billed and
security and service management services, managed data services         paid on a monthly basis.

Usage, other optional or non-subscription services, and pay-per-        As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid on a monthly
use services                                                            basis.
Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods                  When control is passed to the customer, generally when the
                                                                        customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in packages
                                                                        or on interest-free terms, customers usually pay in equal instalments
                                                                        over 6 to 36 months.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the transaction price
     Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
     entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
     is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.
     We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within
     that product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value
     of money. The ‘expected value’ or ‘most likely amount’ methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount
     where it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction
     price. In making this determination consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as
     well as factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience with
     similar types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations,
     as well as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions,
     incentives, penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.

     Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
     Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
     performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative
     stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the
     observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar
     customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into account
     reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of customer. In
     determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum
     enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as
     revenue as they are earned.

     Distinct goods and services
     We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
     individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
     items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products
     and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.

     Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
     We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the
     methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Refer to page 88 for Spark’s
     accounting policy on timing of satisfaction of performance obligations.

2.5 Non-GAAP measures
Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’). Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in
the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate
performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they
should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not
uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the telecommunications industry.
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
expenses and impairments) individually greater than $25 million. There are no adjusting items for the years ended 30 June 2022 or 30
June 2021.                                                                                                                                                  2
Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment income
(EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back depreciation and amortisation, finance expense and income tax expense and subtracting finance
income and net investment income (which includes dividend income and Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint
ventures) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with,
those presented in these financial statements.

non-cash additions that may be required by NZ IFRS, such as decommissioning costs) and additions to capacity right-of-use assets where
such additions are paid up front.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
receivables is estimated to be $75 million (30 June 2021: $213 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value because of the short term to maturity.

Contract assets
Contract assets primarily relate to Spark’s rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting
date. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. The following summarises significant changes
in those balances:

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Contract costs
Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract (such as commission costs) and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be
recovered and are therefore initially deferred and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is consistent with
the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises significant changes in those
balances:

    Key estimates and assumptions
    Determining the costs we incur to obtain or fulfil a contract that meets the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires us to make
    significant judgements. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise
    the costs within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer
    tenure for consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.


Expected credit loss allowance provision
Movements in the loss allowance provision are as follows:

1 The total expected loss provision reduced by $14 million in FY21, of which $8 million reflected the release of additional provisions taken in FY20 primarily as a result of
  Covid-19.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
loss provision for trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and other receivables. The
calculation of the allowance provision incorporates forward-looking information, such as forecasted economic conditions.
The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                                  CURRENT      ≤ 1 MONTH      > 1 MONTH            TOTAL

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be
subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.


     Key estimates and assumptions
     The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
     rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
     impairment calculation based on Spark’s past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates
     at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
     unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product in New Zealand.

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Finance lease receivables
Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in
Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore
shown as a net finance lease receivable or net lease liability on the statement of financial position.

In addition, Spark sublease a number of office building floors. Where sublease are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable term of
the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.

The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

1 Included within the discounted balance as at 30 June 2022 is a $2 million sublease receivable asset, offset by a $2 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease
  receivable (30 June 2021: $4 million sublease receivable asset, offset by a $1 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease receivable).

The lease with Chorus, where Spark is the lessor, has multiple rights of renewals and the full lease term has been used in the majority of
the calculation of the financial lease receivable at lease inception, as it was likely that because of the specialised nature of the buildings,
the lease would be renewed to the maximum term.

Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited, Inc. and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited (together
‘Southern Cross’) as their carrying values were reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross’ deficits or repay dividends.
For the year ended 30 June 2022 Spark’s share of Southern Cross profits was not recognised because of the existence of historic
cumulative Southern Cross deficits. In the current year Southern Cross’ profit was $39 million (30 June 2021: $39 million).

1 Remeasurements to property in FY22 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases and exiting of space in exchange buildings. The reduction in
  property right-of-use assets for corporate property leases is substantially offset by a reduction in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).
2 Remeasurements to property in FY21 primarily relate to modifications and changes of assumptions for leases, including market rent reviews and reductions in lease
  terms for corporate property leases. The reduction in property right-of-use assets is substantially offset by a reduction in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).

Of the $8 million within capacity additions for the year ended 30 June 2022, $7 million were fully paid on control being obtained and
therefore deemed capital expenditure as reconciled in note 2.5 (30 June 2021: all fully paid and deemed capital expenditure).
Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets for the year ended 30 June 2022 was $3 million (30 June 2021: $1 million).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.4 Right-of-use assets (continued)

     Key estimates and assumptions
     At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the
     contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess
     whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
     • The contract involves the use of an identified asset
     • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use
     • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset.
     At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
     to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
     commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
     adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
     estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is
     located, less any lease incentives received.
     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
     the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are
     determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for
     impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.



3.5 Leased customer equipment assets
Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of lease arrangements for customer premises equipment. Such
arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a genuine sale if control
of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that a sale does not occur, as
control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor.
Spark as the seller-lessee continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset, which is initially measured at cost. The asset is
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term. Movements in leased customer equipment
assets are summarised below:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Joint arrangement
Spark has entered into a joint arrangement in relation to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic
submarine cable between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2022 the carrying value of Spark’s share of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in the joint operation was $30 million (30 June 2021: $30 million).



     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark’s property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets’
     estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires management
     judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
     obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark’s property, plant and equipment is as follows:

     Telecommunications equipment
     Links and cables                          10 – 50 years
     Network transport                         3 – 15 years

     The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
     conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
     flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
     include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
     for valuing future cash flows.

    Key estimates and assumptions
    Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment
    annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement, including assessing the
    expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark
    ceasing to use it.
    The estimated useful lives of Spark intangible assets is as follows:
    Spectrum licences                                                 2 – 21 years
    Software		                                                        2 – 12 years
    Customer contracts and brands                                     5 – 10 years
    Other intangible assets                                           2 – 100 years

On 31 January 2022, Spark acquired the remaining 50% of its joint venture, Connect 8 Limited, a fibre network construction company.
Goodwill recognised from the acquisition of $12 million has been allocated to each CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of
the transaction. Goodwill of $6 million has been allocated to the mobile CGU, $3 million to the broadband CGU and $3 million to the
cloud, security and service management CGU.
During the years ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of the carrying value of
goodwill. Headroom currently exists in each CGU and, based on sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.


     Key estimates and assumptions
     Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment using a value-in-use model, which estimates the future cash flows, based on the
     FY23 Board-approved business plan, applied to the next three years, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital
     expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU
     performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include
     revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future
     technology paths.
     Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 10.6% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2022
     (30 June 2021: 10.0%).

1 Remeasurements to property in FY22 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases. The reduction in lease liabilities is substantially offset by a
  reduction in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4).
2 Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark’s
  option.
3 Remeasurements to property in FY21 primarily relate to modifications and changes of assumptions for leases, including market rent reviews and reductions in lease
  terms for corporate property leases. The reduction in lease liabilities is substantially offset by a reduction in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4).

4.2 Lease liabilities (continued)

  Key estimates and assumptions
  Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
  the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
  rate cannot be readily determined, Spark’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as
  the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
  Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
  • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments
  • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement
    date
  • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee
  • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise
  • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.
  The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
  future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark’s estimate of the amount expected
  to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or
  extension option.
  When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
  asset or it is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
  Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of
  12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within
  operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Liabilities and equity


4.3 Debt
Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and
measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes
attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in

4.3 Debt (continued)
None of Spark’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark’s debt,
however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default
over Spark’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021.
The fair value of long-term debt, including long-term debt due within one year, based on market observable prices, was $1,359 million
compared to a carrying value of $1,347 million as at 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: fair value of $1,270 million compared to a carrying value
of $1,245 million).

4.4 Capital risk management
Spark manages its capital considering shareholders interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board is
committed to the Company maintaining an investment grade rating and its capital management policies are designed to ensure this
objective is met. As part of this commitment Spark currently manages its debt levels to ensure that the ratio of net debt at hedged rates
(being inclusive of associated derivatives) to EBITDAI does not materially exceed 1.4 times on a long-run basis, which for credit rating
purposes, Spark estimates equates approximately to adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 1.7 times. The difference between these two ratios is
primarily due to the credit rating agency managing adjustments for leases and captive finance operations.
As at 30 June 2022 the Company’s Standard and Poor’s credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was, respectively, A- and A-2 with
outlook stable (30 June 2021: same).

Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to                                     4
arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge
adjustments and any unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.

2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have
  no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

1 Spark’s American Depositary Shares, each representing five ordinary Spark shares and evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), are traded over-the-counter
  in the United States. This is a Level 1 ADR programme that is sponsored by Bank of New York Mellon. For H2 FY22 these are based on the exchange rate at 17 August
  2022 of NZ$1 to US$0.6282 and a ratio of five ordinary shares per one American Depositary Share. The actual exchange rate used for conversion is determined in the
  week prior to payment when the Bank of New York Mellon performs the physical currency conversion.
2 Supplementary dividends are paid to non-resident shareholders.



    Dividend Reinvestment Plan
    The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders can elect to receive dividends in additional shares.
    For the year ended 30 June 2022 shares with a total value of $18 million (30 June 2021: $131 million) were issued in lieu of
    dividends. Shares issued in lieu of dividends are excluded from dividends paid in the statement of cash flows.
    The dividend reinvestment plan has been suspended for the H2 FY22 dividend and for the foreseeable future.

Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest, foreign
exchange and electricity prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other
than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 no
derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting
of any derivative financial instruments is $8 million (30 June 2021: $20 million), which if applied would result in a reduction of derivative
assets and derivative liabilities.

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
Derivatives are designated:
• Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt
• Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions
• Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in
  cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective
cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate debt
and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency fixed-rate debt into variable rate debt.
Electricity hedge contracts were designated in cash flow hedges to reduce electricity price risk from price fluctuations. These hedge
contracts established the price at which future specified quantities of electricity are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be
paid or received was recognised as a component of electricity costs through the term of the contracts.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

Other amounts deferred in equity will be transferred to the statement of profit or loss over the next three years (30 June 2021: four years).
Included within the closing balance at 30 June 2022 is $3 million relating to the cost of hedging reserve (30 June 2021: $3 million).
The movement in the hedge reserves includes $98 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $27 million associated
deferred tax (30 June 2021: $68 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $19 million associated deferred tax,
$6 million in relation to electricity derivatives and $2 million for forward foreign exchange contracts).

Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
year ended 30 June 2022 there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2021: no material
ineffectiveness) and as a result no material changes have been recognised in profit and loss.

Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark’s risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are
excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
of the debt.                                                                                                                                               5
The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRSs are recognised in
other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred
to profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

Spark manages currency risk arising from foreign currency debt
through hedging. Spark’s long-term debt issued in NOK and AUD
is fully hedged using cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert
foreign currency cashflows into floating-rate New Zealand dollar
exposures.
Currency risk from capital and operational expenditure in foreign
currencies (and related trade payables) has been substantially
hedged by entering into forward exchange contracts.

Sensitivity to foreign currency movements
As at 30 June 2022 a movement of 10% in the New Zealand dollar
would (after hedging) impact the statement of profit or loss by less
than $1 million (30 June 2021: less than $3 million) and the
statement of changes in equity by less than $12 million (30 June
2021: less than $19 million). This analysis assumes a movement in
the New Zealand dollar across all currencies and only includes the
effect of foreign exchange movements on monetary financial
instruments.

Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AUD$461 million
at 30 June 2022 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2021: AUD$461 million). These losses and temporary
differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the
production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority requirements.
Spark has a negative 16 million imputation credit account balance as at 30 June 2022 due to the timing of dividend and tax payments
(30 June 2021: negative 18 million). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021.

6.2 Employee share schemes
Spark operates share-based compensation plans that are equity settled as outlined below.

Restricted share schemes (RSS)
A restricted share scheme was initially introduced for selected employees in September 2001. For new allocations after August 2015 these
were replaced by two new restricted share schemes:
• Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme
• Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long-Term Incentive Scheme.
The Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme is for the senior leaders including the Leadership Squad and delivers one scheme
with the same set of rules under one long-term incentive, with a performance hurdle in place. The Spark New Zealand Managing Director
Long-Term Incentive Scheme related to the previous Managing Director, Simon Moutter.
Under these restricted share schemes, ordinary shares in the Company are issued to Spark Trustee Limited. Participants purchase shares
from Spark Trustee Limited with funds lent to them by the Company and which are held on their behalf by Spark Trustee Limited. If the
individual is still employed by Spark at the end of the vesting period (generally three years) and applicable performance hurdles are met,
the employee is provided a cash bonus, which must be used to repay the loan and the shares are then transferred to the individual. The
target for this hurdle is the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. The last year when RSS shares were granted was
FY19 therefore FY22 was the last year where RSS shares vested.

6.2 Employee share schemes (continued)
Share option scheme
From September 2019, members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders have been granted options
under the new Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme. Under the scheme participants are granted options at the start of the three-
year vesting period. The number of options granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark
New Zealand shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment,
at vesting each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark
employment) then the options simply lapse, with exceptions for redundancy, death and disablement. Spark enables participants to meet
tax obligations through PAYE by authorising the sale of a sufficient number of shares on their behalf.
Vesting of the LTI grants are contingent on: participants’ continued employment with Spark for three years from grant date (subject to
exceptions); and the Company achieving the specified performance hurdles. The performance hurdle targets are set annually and for
grants issued in 2019, 2020 and 2021 this was the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. Options with an intrinsic
value of $14 million (30 June 2021: $9 million) remain outstanding at 30 June 2022 and have a weighted average remaining life of
1.3 years (30 June 2021: 1.7 years).
Information regarding shares and options awarded under these schemes is as follows:

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Opinion                        We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries (the
                               ‘Group’), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022, and the
                               consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity
                               and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
                               including a summary of significant accounting policies.
                               In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 79 to 123, present fairly, in all
                               material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022, and its consolidated
                               financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to
                               International Financial Reporting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’) and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’).


Basis for opinion              We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and International
                               Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those standards are further
                               described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our
                               report.
                               We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
                               opinion.
                               We are independent of the Company in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International
                               Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand)
                               issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards
                               Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International
                               Independence Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
                               requirements.
                               Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to regulatory audit, other
                               assurance related services (such as trustee reporting), taxation compliance and non-assurance services
                               provided to the Corporate Taxpayers Group of which Spark New Zealand Limited is a member. These services
                               have not impaired our independence as auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both
                               a sister and brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the
                               provision of any services to the Group and its subsidiaries, and this matter has not impacted our
                               independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the
                               ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or
                               interest in the Group.


Audit materiality              We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements of the
                               Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
                               knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also
                               assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or
                               influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the
                               scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
                               We determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be $27 million.


Key audit matters              Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
                               of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
                               our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
                               not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

                             Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
                             express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
                             Our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the

                             materially misstated. If so, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities The directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the preparation and fair presentation of the
for the consolidated        consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as the
financial statements        directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free

                             In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for
                             assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

                             Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a

statements                   conducted in accordance with ISAs and ISAs (NZ) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
                             Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
                             they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these

1. The figures shown are gross amounts and exclude GST (where applicable) and are rounded to the nearest dollar.
2. Ms Broadbent and Mr MacLeod joined the Board from 1 August 2022 so no fees were payable in FY22.

   duties. This includes providing New Zealand-based directors with mobile phones and $120 per month which can be used towards Spark products or services and overseas-based
   directors with $400 per month phone allowances. Spark also meets the costs of directors’ Spark-related travel. As these costs are incurred by Spark to enable directors to perform
   their duties, no value is attributable to them as benefits to directors for the purposes of the above table.

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary but ideally would increase
this shareholding to 100% of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any long-term incentive schemes. To fulfil this expectation
shares are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019. As at 30 June 2022 the CEO holds 189,508 ordinary shares which fulfils
this expectation to hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary.

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or,
in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive
director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as
at the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased
within a three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, within a three-year period
from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the aggregate sale
price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

Sustainability appendix
This appendix includes GRI-led information related to our most material topics, linking back into the content of the report and to other sources.
As an integrated report we have included disclosure on our sustainability performance throughout this report. Page 8 details our integrated
reporting value creation model, aligned to the ‘capitals’ which each have a dedicated section in the report.
This report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core Option. It also
incorporates climate risk disclosure aligned to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

We publish a summary of our approach to sustainability at Spark on our website. https://www.sparknz.co.nz/sustainability/

Our Sustainability Framework
Sustainability is integrated as a pillar of our business strategy, including our commitment to improving our environmental, social, and
governance performance. Our ambition is to create a positive digital future for all of New Zealand, with clear focus areas outlined in our
Sustainability Framework.
Our Sustainability Framework is informed by our materiality assessment (see page 142). While the three focus areas of the framework are
enduring, the activities within them will evolve over time to ensure we are responsive to our changing operating environment and the needs of
our stakeholders.
Our Sustainability Framework sits alongside our Māori Strategy, Te Korowai Tupu (the cloak of growth of Spark New Zealand), which informs
how we develop strong connections with Māori and builds our understanding of Te Ao Māori.

Materiality
To prioritise Spark’s reporting on sustainability topics we follow the GRI materiality principle (set out in GRI 101) to identify and prioritise topics
which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social, or economic impact.
We also consider the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR> Framework, considering whether a matter could
substantively affect Spark's ability to create value in the short, medium, or long term.
Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of stakeholder feedback, review of industry peers and interviews with external
stakeholders. Internally we consult with a range of employees, including members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk,
legal and HR teams, to determine Spark’s view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria.
In FY22 we have reviewed and updated our list of material impacts. This included a third-party review of our existing materiality assessment
against industry standards (SASB, WEF, GRI) and our global industry peers, including the requirements of our membership of the JAC initiative
(see page 73). Over the past year we have observed increased interest from our business customers in measuring their scope 3 emissions,
including emissions from the services provided by Spark. We have also linked our financing to our performance against our emissions
reduction target (see page 15). The implementation of the Australian Modern Slavery Act, and consultation on a similar act in New Zealand, has
raised interest in labour standards in our workforce and our supply chain. Consultation on New Zealand’s first National Adaptation Plan has also
raised the profile of long-term climate impacts and the topic of adapting to physical risk from climate change.

Stakeholder engagement
Spark engages with a broad range of stakeholders as detailed in the table below. We have also engaged a small number of stakeholders
specifically for the purposes of developing and improving our non-financial reporting and as part of our reporting materiality process.
In selecting the stakeholders we engaged with, we are guided by the definition set out in GRI 101: “entities or individuals that can reasonably
be expected to be significantly affected by the organisation’s activities, products or services; or whose actions can reasonably be expected
to affect the ability of the organisation to implement its strategies or achieve its objectives.”

                    cases such as augmented/virtual reality, cloud gaming, video analytics and other cloud-compute capabilities.
Multi-access edge   Multi-access Edge Computing (MAEC) extends the capabilities of cloud computing by bringing it to the ‘edge’ of
computing           the network. While traditional cloud computing occurs on remote servers that are situated far from the customer
                    and device, MAEC allows this processing to take place much closer to the end customer – meaning data has to
                    travel a shorter distance, decreasing latency, and the amount of data sent across the network can be reduced,
                    reducing congestion and delivering a better customer experience.
Network slicing     Network slicing allows the operator to ‘slice’ its network to support different types of services through each ‘slice’.
                    Multiple slices can be tuned independently to meet different quality of service parameters. For example, one slice
                    may simply need a standard speed connection to enable office email, another might be tuned to support very low
                    data IoT devices, while another slice may need high reliability and ultra-low latency to support robotics.

Ēkore e taea e te whenu Kotahi
ki te raranga i te whāriki, kia mōhio tātou ki a tātou.
Mā te mahitahi o ngā whenu,
ma te mahitahi o ngā kai raranga,
ka oti tenei whāriki.
I te o tinga, me titiro ki ngā pai ka puta mai.
Ā tāna wā, me titiro I ngā raranga i makere.
Nō te mea, he kōrero ano kei reira.

The tapestry of understanding cannot be woven
by one strand alone.

Only by the working together of strands, and the
working together of weavers, will such a tapestry
be completed.

When it has been completed, let us look at the
good that comes from it.

In time, we should also look at those stitches,
which have been dropped because they also
send a message.
