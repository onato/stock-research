1. Reported revenue and EBITDAI excludes the results of the data centre business which has been classified as a discontinuing operation in the financial statements.
2. Adjusted numbers in FY25 include the impacts of removing the $71 million gain on sale of the remaining investment in Connexa, and the $53 million transformation
   costs associated with Spark’s SPK-26 Operate Programme and any associated tax impacts. They also include the results of the data centre business for both years which
   has been classified as a discontinuing operation in the financial statements. The prior year net earnings has been adjusted for the $26 million impact of the government
   change to tax depreciation rules for buildings.
3. Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment income (EBITDAI) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) are
   non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) performance measures that are defined in note 2.5 of the financial statements.
4. Reported net earnings includes earnings from both continuing and discontinuing operations.
5. The prior year IT revenue and data centre revenue has been restated to more accurately reflect how these products are viewed.
6. Data centre revenue includes both continuing ($4 million) and discontinuing operations ($46 million).
7. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined on page 7 of Spark's FY25 Detailed Financials.
8. Reported return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated as net operating profit (EBITDAI less depreciation and amortisation for both continuing and discontinuing
   operations) after tax (at 28%) as a percentage of average invested capital (total debt including leases plus equity).

                                  Tēnā koutou,
                                  The past financial year has been one of the most challenging
                                  periods in Spark’s history, as we navigated economic headwinds,
                                  materially lower customer spending, and ongoing structural change
                                  in some of our markets. We acknowledge that not all the challenges
                                  we faced were beyond our control and understand our shareholders
                                  will rightly be concerned by our performance over the past year.
                                  At our AGM in November, I outlined the action we would take to
                                  stabilise performance. Good progress has been made against these

                            line with revised guidance but down 8.9% on FY24. Adjusted NPAT

                            While we are not immune to economic volatility, we accept
                            responsibility for our performance and have undertaken a

                            the years ahead.

                            Refocusing on our core of connectivity
                            Connectivity is our core business, with mobile alone contributing

                            Our overall mobile service revenue reduced during the year, driven

                            we earn per customer – increased by around 3% in the second half.
                            The prepaid market was tougher and is characterised by more
                            competition in the value segments of the market. Here we saw

                            pressure on ARPU, we were pleased to see the connection decline
                            stabilise in the second half.

During FY25 we established four strategic priorities to transform our
performance:

Market momentum in our telco core
We renewed our focus on our core business, with a particular focus
on our market of mobile, to build momentum and strengthen our
market leadership. While the mobile market was challenging in
FY25, this renewed focus has improved performance as we move
into FY26 – with ARPU growth in consumer (our measure of how
much revenue we earn from each customer), connection
stabilisation in enterprise and government, and Spark stabilising
its market share3 in the fourth quarter.

Simplified portfolio
We reviewed non-core assets to consider if Spark remained the
best owner, or if greater shareholder value could be created from
divestment. This culminated in the divestment of our Connexa and
HTAL4 shareholdings, generating combined proceeds of
$356 million5.
In our enterprise and government division, we undertook a
significant simplification programme focused on integrating
subsidiaries into Spark and product rationalisation for improved
customer outcomes.

Transformed cost base
We transformed our IT delivery model, which refers to how we
operate our network and IT at Spark, through the formation of four
strategic global partnerships – with Microsoft, Nokia, Infosys and
HPE. We are leveraging the scale and capability of these partners
to augment our own expertise and deliver efficiency and customer                         Generating value through our data centre

Combined with a review of our broader Spark operating model,                             We undertook a process to identify a capital partner for our data

Reported and adjusted results
Spark’s FY25 financial results include reported and adjusted figures. Reported EBITDAI includes continuing operations and removes the results
of the data centre business, which is classified as a discontinuing operation. This means data centre net earnings are disclosed separately in the
Financial Statements. Adjusted numbers include the results of the data centre business, remove the $71m gain on sale from the Connexa stake
and the $53 million of transformation costs in FY25, and in FY24 remove the $26 million impact of the government change to tax depreciation
rules for buildings. This provides a like-for-like, year-on-year performance comparison. A detailed reconciliation is contained on page 9 of
Spark’s Detailed Financials.

    Connexa business of $309 million, and a $150 million reduction
    in payments for capital expenditure7, largely due to lower spend
    on the Standalone 5G network, combined with timing-related
    higher network payments in the prior year.
•   Financing cash outflows were $593 million in FY25, consisting
    mainly of dividend payments of $302 million and net
    repayments of debt of $197 million (following the receipt of the
    Connexa proceeds).
•   Free cash flow was flat year-on-year, with the decline in EBITDAI
    offset by lower cash payments for capital expenditure included
    in free cash flow, and increased payments for interest.




6. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined on page 7 of Spark’s
   FY25 Detailed Financials.
7. Payments for capital expenditure includes purchase of property, plant and
   equipment, intangibles (excluding spectrum), capacity, and assets
   classified as held for sale.

8. CAPEX is a non-GAAP performance measure that is defined in note 2.5 of the
   financial statements.
9. CAPEX to operating revenues and other gains for FY25 is calculated on
   adjusted operating revenue (excluding the gain on divestment of Connexa) to
   enable a meaningful analysis.
10.Reported return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated as net operating profit
   (EBITDAI less depreciation and amortisation for both continuing and
   discontinuing operations) after tax (at 28%) as a percentage of average
   invested capital (total debt including leases plus equity).

Using Generative AI to improve
customer experience
In FY25 we launched a new tool called ‘Bravety’ to support
our customer care teams. Bravety uses Generative AI
(Gen-AI) to transcribe and summarise live customer calls
in real-time and provides the summary to the care team
member for review immediately after the completion of
the call.
This ensures we have consistent and accurate records and
allows our people to spend more time focusing on our
customers, and less time taking notes.

In March we launched our new mobile brand campaign, ‘What a

favourite tunes without cutting into their data allowances.
We also re-introduced ‘Companion Plans’, rewarding friends and
family on the same account (with the same data inclusions) with a

an increase in base data allowances across all plans, the inclusion of
Australia in SMS and minutes allowances in some of our plans, and
the launch of two new lower-priced value packs for price-conscious
prepaid customers.

Connecting New Zealand businesses,
big and small
As tough economic conditions persisted, our Enterprise and
Government division continued to experience reductions in
business spending and shrinking mobile fleets and fixed connections,
as the public and private sectors reduced workforces. Positively,
connection decline stabilised in the second half and Spark
continued to win new business, with notable new accounts including
Summerset, Deloitte, and New Zealand Red Cross. We also delivered
a range of innovative new services, including the country's first
private 5G network for business with Air New Zealand.
Spark supports over 110,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
in New Zealand through our network of local business hubs. Our
'local like you' model, where each Business Hub is locally owned,
has resonated well with customers, resulting in a notable increase
in our SME Business Hub customer satisfaction score of +5 points in
FY25 to +71. In response to the challenging economic environment
our SME customers faced during the year, we launched the 'AI
Foundations' course in partnership with New York’s Section Business
School. This initiative provided 2,000 Spark customers with essential
AI skills to enhance their productivity.

Keeping our customers safe online
Spark puts cyber security, customer safety, and privacy at the

    Spark signs Quadrent Green Lease
    A partnership between Quadrent and Spark has resulted in
    hundreds of high school students in low-decile schools
    receiving laptops to use, with more laptops to be donated over
    the next four years

    Through the Quadrent Green Lease initiative, Spark leases the
    laptops its employees use. Once the lease has ended, the
    laptops are then donated to schools, helping to bridge the digital
    divide for students without access to essential learning tools.

    To accelerate Spark’s donations, Quadrent bought more than
    3,000 laptops from Spark. The proceeds from their resale in the
    secondary market have enabled more than 800 brand new
    laptops to be purchased for donation. Four hundred of these
    have already been delivered to schools, providing vital digital
    resources to up to 30 classrooms, with the first beneficiaries
    being South Auckland schools – Papakura High School,
    Papatoetoe High School, and Māngere College.

People engagement
We measure the engagement of our people at least twice a year
to understand our people’s views and needs. We use a globally
recognised measure of engagement that covers pride in working
at Spark, whether they would recommend Spark as a great place to
work, their level of motivation, and the likelihood of staying with
Spark in the near future.
Feedback from these surveys is shared with our people, with
improvement actions then co-created within teams to improve
our ways of working and culture. At the end of FY25 our people
engagement score was 50%, which is down from 67% a year ago.
This drop in engagement, while disappointing, is understandable
given the scale of operational change in the business and
challenging performance context over the past 12 months. It is also
in line with the typical reductions experienced by companies going
through significant change.
We did see several positive results emerge from this survey, with
85% of our people saying they feel empowered to make decisions in
their role, and 79% knowing how their work contributes to the goals
of Spark. Feedback on wellbeing and inclusion-related topics were
also strong with 83% agreeing that their leader cares about their
wellbeing, and 81% saying they bring their authentic self to work.
Despite the decrease in overall people engagement, we remain
focused on our ambition to create a culture of high engagement
and inclusion and have clear action plans in place – from the
Leadership Squad to all individual teams – to return to strong
engagement levels, with continual improvement.

Health, safety, and wellbeing
Spark has a well-established health and safety management system,
focused on continuous improvement. It covers all Spark employees
and contractors working at Spark sites and aligns to the Health and
Safety at Work Act (2015) and other relevant legal and regulatory
requirements.
During FY25 no Spark employee or contractor suffered serious
injury or death whilst at work. Our TRIFR (Total Recordable Incident
Frequency Rate) increased to 3.9 per million hours worked, primarily
due to an increase in the number of recordable soft tissue injuries.
No notifiable events were reported under current New Zealand
health and safety legislation.
Spark received one health and safety improvement notice issued by
WorkSafe to its subsidiary, Entelar Group. While no harm occurred
and no injuries were sustained, the usual safety process was not
followed. As a result, Entelar Group reviewed its policy, provided
additional training for its warehouse teams and contractors, and
built better traffic management plans at its warehouses.
Wellbeing remains a clear priority at Spark through Mahi Tahi, our
wellbeing programme. The four pillars of the Mahi Tahi framework
are closely aligned with Te Whare Tapa Wha (the four cornerstones
of Māori health) – healthy work environment; connection,
collaboration, and community; mind health; and energy.
                                                                        Investing in learning and development

Diversity, equity, and inclusion
Research demonstrates, and we know from our own experience
and agile ways of working, that diverse teams and diversity of
thought deliver better business results. This is why our commitment
to diversity, equity, and inclusion is a strategic business priority.
In addition to measuring our diversity and setting targets for
improvement, we also take the time to celebrate the things that
make our teams unique through our ‘Blue Heart’ programme. In
FY25 we celebrated many cultural events that are important to our
people, such as Diwali, Eid, Matariki, and Pasifika language weeks.

Te Korowai Tupu
Building our cultural competency in te ao Māori supports our ability
to engage our people, our customers, and our communities –
particularly iwi. Guided by Te Korowai Tupu, our Māori strategy,
we have embedded te ao Māori competency into our learning
framework over the past year.
During FY25, over 500 of our people have participated in various
learning activities – including te reo Māori or tikanga courses
through our partners Te Wānanga o Aotearoa and Education Perfect,
Māori development training with Hapai Tūhono, and in-house
training. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with
increased confidence in engaging with Māori customers and
stakeholders.
We celebrated Waitangi Day, Matariki, and Te Wiki o te Reo Māori
to encourage engagement with kaupapa Māori and build our
people’s te reo Māori language skills. A highlight for FY25 was the
blessing of our new office in Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) by Ngāti
Whātua Ōrakei.

Our diversity performance
Over the past year we have continued to focus on improving female representation to achieve our ambition of 40:40:20 representation
Spark-wide, which refers to 40% men, 40% women, and 20% of any gender1. In FY25, female representation across Spark increased from
34% in FY24 to 35%.
Across our Leadership Squad and senior leaders, we maintained 40:40:20 representation, which is fundamental to reaching our broader
diversity ambitions. Our Leadership Squad had a 50% female and 50% male split in FY25. Our Board had a 57% female and 43% male split
in FY25, with four female directors (including our CEO) and three male directors. Following the conclusion of the financial year we announced
changes to our Board composition, with two directors resigning from the Board, and three new directors joining in FY26. As a result, from
October 1 2025, our Board composition will be 50% female and 50% male, meeting our 40:40:20 ambition.
In addition to the tables below, we also publish a stand-alone ESG Data Pack which includes detailed employee reporting, including
employees by contract type, benefits available to employees by contract type, and parental leave return rates.

Reducing our gender pay gap
Our ambition was to reduce our median gender pay gap by 10 percentage points from 28% in FY21 to 18% by the end of FY25. We have
made steady progress in recent years, with our closing pay gap at the end of FY25 at 23%. Whilst we did not achieve the 10 percentage point
reduction we had targeted, looking ahead to FY26 we will maintain our focus on achieving a reduction in our median gender pay gap with new
goals to be set as part of our FY30 strategic ambitions. This will continue to require improvements in female representation and progression in
specialist skilled areas and roles as well as a sharper focus on our partnerships, pathways and practices.
Despite the median gender pay gap progress not being as significant as we would have liked by FY25, our mean (average) gender pay gap
has continued to improve from 12% in FY24 to 11% in FY25.

Focusing on improving ethnic representation
In FY25 we continued our focus on attracting, retaining, and progressing a diverse range of people across our organisation. Our people
identify with 176 unique ethnicities, and this diversity contributes strongly to our workplace culture. We had an ambition to lift Māori and
Pasifika representation by 5 percentage points by the end of FY26, which at this point in time has proven challenging. In FY25, Māori and
Pasifika represented ~8% of our workforce, which was down on the previous year. We remain committed to improving Māori and Pasifika
representation to ensure we reflect New Zealand's changing demographics and the diversity of our customers. As part of our strategic
ambitions ahead we will put in place a revised ambition and pathway out to FY30.

Long-Term Incentive scheme
For FY25 the CEO’s LTI was granted as share options under the
Spark Long-Term Incentive Scheme described under Long-Term
Incentive scheme on page 48.
The LTI component of the CEO’s remuneration package is designed
to link part of her remuneration to the long-term performance of
Spark, and align her interests with those of shareholders, through
the grant of options with post-allocation performance hurdles.

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary. Ideally this shareholding
would increase to 100% of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any Long-Term Incentive schemes. To fulfil this expectation shares
are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019. As at 30 June 2025 the CEO held 311,830 ordinary shares which exceeded the
expected shareholding requirement to hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary.

Board remuneration
Director remuneration
The remuneration of directors is reviewed annually by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC), taking account of the
company’s size and complexity and the responsibilities, skills, performance, and experience of the directors, with recommendations made to
the Board for approval. Specialist independent consultants may be engaged from time to time to provide advice and ensure that the
remuneration of Spark’s directors is appropriate and comparable to that of similar companies in New Zealand and Australia.

Apart from the CEO, no director of Spark receives compensation in the form of share options or restricted shares, nor do they participate in any
bonus or profit-sharing plan. Non-executive directors are, however, expected to maintain a holding of Spark shares as set out on page 60 of
this report. As is the case for employees, directors are required to comply with the Insider Trading Policy when buying or selling Spark shares
and any such transactions are disclosed to the market.

Remuneration components
No superannuation or retirement allowance was paid to any Spark director during FY25. Spark does not have service contracts with any
director, apart from the CEO, that provide for any benefits or remuneration in the event that a director’s service with Spark is terminated.
New Zealand-based non-executive directors are eligible for Spark-funded medical insurance, and all non-executive directors are also eligible
for Spark-funded life insurance.

FY25 director remuneration
The total remuneration available to non-executive directors is fixed by shareholders. The current annual remuneration limit is $1,630,000
approved at the annual meeting held in November 2017.

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or,
in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive
director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as at
the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased
within a three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was within a three-year
period from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the
aggregate sale price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.
Directors’ insurance
Directors disclosed, for the purposes of section 162 of the Companies Act 1993, that insurance was renewed for Spark’s directors and senior
managers for the 12-month period from 1 June 2025 and deeds of indemnity provided to all directors and specified senior managers of Spark.

Shareholdings
As at 30 June 2025 there were 1,889,322,507 Spark ordinary shares on issue, each conferring to the registered holder the right to one vote on

Tax governance
Spark’s Tax Strategy demonstrates our commitment to the highest
standards of tax governance and compliance with tax laws. As a
New Zealand-based company we believe that it is important to clearly
articulate our tax contribution in a transparent manner to provide
certainty and confidence to our stakeholders. As a large business,
we make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s tax base,
including contributing $186 million of New Zealand income taxes
during FY25 (before any tax credits were applied).
In FY25 Spark’s effective tax rate was 27.4%, which is marginally
lower than the headline corporate tax rate of 28%, mainly due to the
impact of the Connexa transaction.
Spark’s contribution extends beyond income tax and covers a broad
range of tax collection and remittance obligations across various tax
types. In FY25 those obligations resulted in a total of $623 million of
taxes under management (FY24: $587m).

                  Integrating ESG into our governance processes
                  Spark is committed to the continuous improvement of our ESG
                  performance. Our sustainability governance structure helps us
                  ensure sustainability is overseen at the highest levels of our
                  organisation and embedded throughout our everyday operations.
                  Our Board and Leadership Squad have oversight of our sustainability
                  performance. Quarterly updates on our performance against our
                  sustainability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are provided to the
                  Leadership Squad, which serves as a business-wide sustainability
                  steering committee. The Board has overall governance
                  responsibility for sustainability and is provided with a quarterly
                  update on sustainability performance. The Board also approves
                  the sustainability framework and reviews and approves key policies
                  related to ESG.
                  To support our ESG performance we have a number of cross-
                  functional squads. Our Governance and Reporting squad is
                  accountable for our performance, reporting, and risk management,
                  and includes representatives from Spark’s financial, risk, legal,
                  investor relations, regulatory affairs, people and culture, and
                  corporate relations functions. The Human Rights and Supply Chain
                  squad is focused on actions to further embed these topics into
                  Spark’s day-to-day operations, and includes representatives from
                  our value management (supply chain), legal, digital trust, and
                  Entelar Group teams.
                  Our Emissions Reduction Squad is led by Spark’s Environment
                  Manager and is focused on mobile networks, data centres, and fleet,
                  and measures and reports our energy use and emissions on a
                  quarterly basis to the Emissions Reduction Steering Committee and
                  Leadership Squad.
                  Spark’s Data Ethics Committee includes representatives from the
                  Leadership Squad and provides oversight of our AI Principles and
                  how they are embedded into our ways of working, processes, and
                  systems. Our Due Diligence Committee includes representatives
                  from the Leadership Squad who review Spark’s disclosures against
                  the requirements and principles of the Climate Standards.

No write-down was recognised in the statement of profit or loss on classification of the above assets and liabilities to held for sale as the
estimated selling price is expected to exceed the carrying value. At the time these financial statements were authorised for issue, the
transaction had not yet completed and as such a final estimate of the gain or loss on sale has not yet been made.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information



Section 2 Financial performance
information
2.1 Segment information
The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how Spark reviews its performance.
Spark's material assets and operations are in New Zealand, therefore no separate geographical information is provided.
Spark's segments are measured based on product margin, which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs.
The segment results exclude other gains, labour, other operating expenses, finance income and expense, depreciation and amortisation,
net investment income and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall Group level by the Chief Executive.

Comparative segment results
Spark has made minor reclassifications of segment revenues and costs between IT products, IT services, and other products to more
accurately reflect how these products are viewed. In addition, a major part of the data centre business included within other products
segment has been classified as a discontinuing operation in FY25 and the comparative information has been re-presented to reflect this.
See note 1.5 for more details. The remaining part of the data centres segment has been classified within the other products segment.
There is no change to the overall Spark reported result because of these reclassifications.

                                                                            2025                                  2024

2.2 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

Contracts with customers
Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer                                                   2
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling prices
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price
and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over
time is recognised using the 'resources consumed by customers' method or the 'time-elapsed' method, as these best depict the transfer
of goods or services to customers.
Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service
management contracts. Contracts with a significant financing component include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-
free payment terms of greater than 12 months.
The nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS                                                 TIMING OF SATISFACTION

Mobile services, broadband services, media services, cloud,             As the service is provided (usually monthly). Generally billed and
security and service management services, managed data services         paid on a monthly basis.

Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods                  When control is passed to the customer, generally when the
                                                                        customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in packages
                                                                        or on interest-free terms, customers usually pay in equal instalments
                                                                        over 6 to 36 months.

                                                                        the customer.

2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)

   Key estimates and assumptions
   Determining the transaction price
   Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
   entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
   is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.           2
   We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within
   that product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value
   of money. The 'expected value' or 'most likely' amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount
   where it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction
   price. In making this determination consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as
   well as factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience with
   similar types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations,
   as well as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions,
   incentives, penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.
   Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
   Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
   performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative
   stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the
   observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar
   customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into account
   reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of customer. In determining
   the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum enforceable
   amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as revenue as they
   are earned.
   Distinct goods and services
   We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
   individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
   items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products
   and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.
   Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
   We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the
   methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Refer to page 81 for Spark's
   accounting policy on timing of satisfaction of performance obligations.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Financial performance information


2.5 Non–GAAP measures
Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information to readers to assist in the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns
of Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to
establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for
measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the
telecommunications industry.

Spark calculates EBITDAI from continuing operations by taking net earnings from continuing operations, adding back finance expense,
depreciation and amortisation and income tax expense, subtracting finance income and adjusting for net investment income (which includes
Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures, interest income on loans receivable from associates and joint ventures,
net impact on remeasurement of equity-accounted investments and dividend income). A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI from continuing
operations is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with, those presented in these financial statements.

2.5 Non–GAAP measures (continued)
Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes one-off significant items (such
as gains, expenses and impairments) individually greater than $25 million. In the year ended 30 June 2025, the net gain on sale of the
remaining Connexa investment of $71 million, the transformation costs associated with Spark’s SPK-26 Operate Programme amounted
to $53 million and any associated tax impacts were deemed significant to adjust. In the year ended 30 June 2024, the tax effects resulting
from the government change to tax depreciation rules for buildings effective for Spark from 1 July 2024 of $26 million was deemed a            2
significant item to adjust.

adjustments and any unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.
A reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt at carrying value is provided in note 4.4.

Net tangible assets
Net tangible assets per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not defined in NZ IFRS. Total assets include assets held for sale and
right-of-use assets. Total liabilities include liabilities classified as held for sale and lease liabilities.

1. Other short-term receivables include $47 million for the sale of shares in Hutchison, received on 17 July 2025, see note 1.3 for further details.
2. FY25 balances have been impacted by the sale of the remaining Connexa investment, see note 1.4 for further details.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
receivables is estimated to be $116 million (30 June 2024: $72 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Contract costs
Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be recovered and are therefore
initially deferred to the statement of financial position and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is
consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises changes in
those balances:

    Key estimates and assumptions
    Determining the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract that meet the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires significant
    judgement. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise the costs
    within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer tenure for
    consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers. The amortisation period of the contract costs
    ranges from 2 years to 11 years.

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
loss provision for trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract costs, and finance lease receivables. The calculation of the allowance
provision incorporates Spark's previous collection history and forward-looking information, such as forecasted economic conditions.
The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                                  CURRENT      ≤ 1 MONTH      > 1 MONTH            TOTAL

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be
subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
    rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
    impairment calculation based on Spark's past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates
    at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
    unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product in New Zealand.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Assets


3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
Finance lease receivables
Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in
Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore
shown as a net finance lease receivable or net lease liability on the statement of financial position.

In FY25, Spark assigned its leases for the Victoria Street Auckland office building to a third party. In FY23, Spark assigned its ground leases
for the mobile site assets sold to Connexa. This resulted in Spark recording finance lease receivables equal to the lease liabilities for these
leases. Spark is unwinding these balances over the remaining term to the next right of renewal, at which point these will be novated.

In addition, Spark subleases a number of office building floors. Where subleases are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable term
of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.

The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

1. The discounted balance as at 30 June 2025 has less than $1 million of sublease receivable assets, offset by less than $1 million liability relating to the Chorus finance
   lease receivable (30 June 2024: $5 million sublease receivable asset, offset by a $1 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease receivable).

The lease with Chorus, where Spark is the lessor, has multiple rights of renewals and the full lease term has been used in the majority of
the calculation of the financial lease receivable at lease inception, as it was likely that because of the specialised nature of the buildings,
the lease would be renewed to the maximum term.

Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited Inc and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited (together
‘Southern Cross’) as their carrying values were reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross deficits or repay dividends.
For the year ended 30 June 2025, Spark's share of Southern Cross profits was not recognised because of the existence of historic
cumulative Southern Cross deficits. In the current year Southern Cross profit was $53 million (30 June 2024: $46 million).

1. Remeasurements to property in FY25 and FY24 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property and mobile site leases. The increase/(decrease) in the
   right-of-use assets for corporate property leases is substantially offset by an increase/(decrease) in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).
2. Depreciation includes charges for continuing and discontinuing operations.

All capacity additions for the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 were fully paid on control being obtained and therefore
deemed capital expenditure, which is a non-GAAP measure, as defined and reconciled in note 2.5.
Income from subleasing right-of-use assets for the year ended 30 June 2025 was $1 million (30 June 2024: $2 million).
Spark New Zealand Annual Report FY25          Hello tomorrow                                                                           95

3.4 Right–of–use assets (continued)

    Key estimates and assumptions
    At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the
    contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess
    whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
    • The contract involves the use of an identified asset
    • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use
    • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset
    At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
    to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
    commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
    adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
    estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is
    located, less any lease incentives received.
    The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
                                                                                                                                                      3
    the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are
    determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for
    impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.



3.5 Leased customer equipment assets
Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of lease arrangements for customer premises equipment. Such
arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a genuine sale if control
of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that a sale does not occur, as
control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor. Spark also acts as a lessor, where there is no
intermediate party, for customer premises equipment.
Spark as the seller-lessee or lessor (when the lease is an operating lease) continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset,
which is initially measured at cost. The assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful
lives. Movements in leased customer equipment assets are summarised below:

Spark New Zealand Annual Report FY25        Hello tomorrow                                                                      97

3.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Joint arrangement
Spark has a joint arrangement relating to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic submarine cable
between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2025, the carrying values of Spark's share of property, plant and equipment and
capacity right-of-use assets in the joint operation were $10 million and $19 million, respectively (30 June 2024: $11 million and
$20 million, respectively).



   Key estimates and assumptions
   Spark's property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets'
   estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires management
   judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
   obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
   The estimated useful lives of Spark's property, plant and equipment are as follows:
   Telecommunications equipment                                                                                                      3
   Links and cables                    9 – 50 years
   Network transport                   2 – 15 years
   Mobile radio access network         5 – 25 years
   Customer premises equipment         3 – 5 years
   International cable and satellite   10 – 15 years
   Buildings
   Buildings                           15 – 53 years
   Furniture and fittings              3 – 20 years
   Air conditioning                    5 – 20 years
   Power systems                       3 – 25 years
   Batteries                           5 – 15 years
   Other
   Motor vehicles                      6 years
   Computer equipment                  2 – 8 years
   Internal IT system assets           3 – 15 years
   The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
   conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
   flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
   include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
   for valuing future cash flows.

1. Included in additions is $3 million (30 June 2024: $8 million) of assets fully funded by customers or vendors. Total software capitalised in the year ended 30 June 2025
   includes $97 million (30 June 2024: $84 million) of internally generated assets. Other software capitalised in the year includes software licences and externally
   supplied labour.




    Key estimates and assumptions
    Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment
    annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement, including assessing the
    expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark
    ceasing to use it.
    The estimated useful lives of Spark's intangible assets are as follows:
    Spectrum licences                                          2 - 21 years
    Software                                                   2 - 16 years
    Customer contracts and brands                              5 - 10 years
    Other intangible assets                                    2 - 100 years

On 28 February 2025, Spark sold its subsidiary Digital Island Limited, excluding Digital Island’s mobile services business which has been        3
transferred to Spark. $4 million of goodwill was disposed as part of the sale and the remaining $13 million relating to the retained mobile
business was transferred to the mobile CGU in Spark.

Goodwill from IT products and IT services of $10 million relating to the data centre business has been classified as assets held for sale
during FY25, see note 1.5 for further details.

During the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024, no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of the carrying value of
goodwill. Headroom currently exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.


    Key estimates and assumptions
    Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment using a value-in-use model, which estimates the future cash flows, based on the
    FY25 Board-approved business plan, applied to the next three years, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital
    expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU
    performance. The key inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include
    revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future
    technology paths.
    Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2025
    (30 June 2024: 11.3%). Management considers that the risk aspects, prospects and exposure are sufficiently similar to apply
    these rates across all CGU's.

1. Remeasurements in FY25 and FY24 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property and mobile site leases. For corporate properties, the increase/(decrease) in
    lease liabilities is substantially offset by an increase/(decrease) in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4). For mobile site remeasurements, there is not an equal
    adjustment to right-of-use assets as the majority of these adjustments relate to Connexa leases which have a smaller right-of-use asset due to the sale and leaseback
    transaction.
2.		Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark's
    option, including leases committed to that have not yet commenced.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Liabilities and equity


4.2 Lease liabilities (continued)

   Key estimates and assumptions
   Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
   the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
   rate cannot be readily determined, Spark's incremental borrowing rate. Generally Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as
   the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
   Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability which comprise:
   • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments
   • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
     commencement date
   • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee
   • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise
   • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option
   The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if
   there is a change in Spark's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes
   its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or extension option.
   When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
   asset or it is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
   Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of
   12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within
   operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

4.3 Debt
Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and
measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes
attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Liabilities and equity


4.3 Debt (continued)
Changes in Spark’s short-term and long-term financing are disclosed in note 1.3 of these financial statements.
None of Spark's debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark's debt,
however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default
over Spark's debt in the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024.
The fair value of total debt based on market observable prices was $1,489 million compared to a carrying value of $1,482 million as at
30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: fair value of $1,635 million compared to a carrying value of $1,619 million).

4.4 Capital risk management
Spark manages its capital considering shareholders' interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board
is focused on the Company retaining a strong balance sheet, targeting metrics consistent with its current S&P Global credit ratings.
At 30 June 2025, Spark's net debt to EBITDAI (including lease liabilities) ratio was 2.2x. As a result of the Hutchison investment sale
proceeds received in July 2025 and the expected sale of the data centre business, which was announced in August 2025, Spark expects
that its net debt to EBITDAI ratio will reduce by 0.5x by the end of H1 FY26.
As at 30 June 2025, the Company’s S&P Global credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was, respectively, A- and A-2 with outlook
negative (30 June 2024: A- and A-2 with outlook stable).

1. Net debt at hedged rates is the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity.
2. Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in dual fair value and cash flow hedges.
   These have no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and foreign
exchange prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other than quoted
prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024, no derivative financial
assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting of any derivative
financial instruments is $10 million (30 June 2024: $11 million), which if applied would result in a reduction of derivative assets and
derivative liabilities.

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
Derivatives are designated as:
• Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt.
• Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.
• Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability
  in cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an                    5
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective
cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of
the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark's own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in
the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate
debt and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency floating-rate (variable) debt into
fixed-rate debt.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

Included within the closing balance at 30 June 2025 is $3 million relating to the cost of hedging reserve (30 June 2024: $4 million). The
movement in the hedge reserves includes $45 million in the change in fair value of cross-currency and domestic interest rate swaps less
$13 million associated deferred tax and $4 million for forward foreign exchange contracts (30 June 2024: $1 million for forward foreign
exchange contracts).

Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
year ended 30 June 2025, there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2024: no material
ineffectiveness) and as a result, no material changes have been recognised in profit and loss.

Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark's risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are
excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
Spark's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
of the debt.
The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRSs are recognised in
other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to
profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

Spark manages its exposure using a credit policy that includes
limits on exposures with significant counterparties that have been
set and approved by the Board and are monitored on a regular
basis. Spark places its cash and derivative financial instruments
with high-credit quality financial institutions and does not have
significant concentration of risk with any single financial institution.
Spark has finance lease receivables which are deemed low credit
risk. Concentration of credit risk for trade and other receivables is
limited because of Spark’s large customer base.
Spark has certain derivatives and debt arrangements that are
subject to bilateral credit support agreements that require Spark or
its counterparties to post collateral funds to support the value of
certain derivatives subject to certain agreed threshold amounts.
As at 30 June 2025, no collateral was posted (30 June 2024: nil).
Letters of credit and guarantees may be held over some receivable
amounts. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the
maximum credit exposure.

6.1 Income tax (continued)
Investment Boost
As part of its 2025 Budget, the New Zealand Government announced the Investment Boost incentive, designed to encourage investment
in new business assets by providing an immediate 20% deduction of the cost of new depreciable assets, including commercial buildings
that are acquired or that become available for use (for the first time) in New Zealand from 22 May 2025. It is an optional incentive with
limited exclusions that applies alongside the existing tax depreciation regime. The incentive is expected to accelerate Spark’s tax
deductions on eligible expenditure from FY26.

Pillar Two legislation
As a large multinational enterprise (MNE) with annual revenue in excess of €750 million, Spark is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two
initiative (Pillar Two) and the associated Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules that enforce Pillar Two. Spark has performed an assessment
of its potential exposure to GloBE top-up taxes utilising the GloBE temporary safe harbour thresholds (Safe Harbour) and has concluded
there is no material impact on its consolidated financial position as at 30 June 2025 (FY25). This position is expected to remain through to
FY28, being the current duration of the Safe Harbour period. Spark’s related FY25 GloBE reporting obligations (related to Australia and the
United Kingdom) are not due until 31 December 2026.

Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AU$461 million at
30 June 2025 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2024: AU$461 million). These losses and temporary differences
may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the production of
taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority requirements.
Spark has a negative 53 million imputation credit account balance as at 30 June 2025 due to the timing of dividend and tax payments
(30 June 2024: negative 67 million). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2025.
Spark has a $114 million taxation recoverable at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: $6 million). This reflects higher provisional tax payments
(including for imputation credit account purposes) and lower than expected taxable earnings in the period to offset those payments.

6.2 Employee share schemes
Spark operates a share-based compensation plan that is equity settled as outlined below.

Share option scheme
From September 2019, members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders have been granted options
under the Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme. Under the scheme participants are granted options at the start of the three-year vesting
period. The number of options granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark New Zealand
shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment, at vesting
each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark employment)
then the options simply lapse, with exceptions for redundancy, death and disablement. Spark enables participants to meet tax obligations
through PAYE by authorising the sale of a sufficient number of shares on their behalf.
Vesting of the LTI grants are contingent on participants’ continued employment with Spark for three years from grant date (subject to
exceptions) and the Company achieving the specified performance hurdles. The performance hurdle targets are set annually and for grant
issued in 2021 this was the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. For grants issued in 2022, 2023, and 2024, 75% of
the allocated shares will vest based on the performance hurdle target of the Company's cost of equity plus 1.5% compounding annually
and 25% will vest based on performance against environmental and diversity targets. Options with an intrinsic value of $8 million (30 June
2024: $13 million) remain outstanding at 30 June 2025 and have a weighted average remaining life of 1.4 years (30 June 2024: 1.3 years).
Information regarding options awarded under this scheme is as follows:

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments is recognised as an expense, with a
corresponding entry in equity. The total charge recognised for this scheme for the year ended 30 June 2025 was $1.5 million (30 June
2024: $1.6 million). As at 30 June 2025, $2.1 million of share scheme awards remain unvested and not expensed (30 June 2024:
$2.5 million). This expense, measured at its fair value based on a valuation model, will be recognised over the remaining vesting period of
the awards. On 21 September 2024, the options granted in September 2021 lapsed.
The grants issued in 2022 were not exercised and lapsed in FY25 with the exception of 14,119 options which vested in accordance with
the scheme rules following the disposal of a subsidiary company. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share

                             and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
                             including material accounting policy information.
                             In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 73 to 119, present fairly, in all
                             material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2025, and its consolidated
                             financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to
                             IFRS Accounting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’) as issued by the External Reporting Board and IFRS Accounting
                             Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Basis for opinion            We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and International
                             Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those standards are further
                             described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of
                             our report.
                             We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
                             our opinion.
                             We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code
                             of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by
                             the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
                             Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
                             Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
                             Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to regulatory audit
                             requirements, other assurance related services (such as trustee reporting, Greenhouse Gas Emissions limited
                             assurance and agreed upon procedures in relation to the sustainability linked loans) and non-assurance
                             services (such as HR Business Partner training programme, CPO Vantage Programme, CFO Vantage
                             Programme as well as administrative and other advisory services provided to the Corporate Taxpayers Group,
                             of which the Group is a member). These services have not impaired our independence as auditor of the
                             Company and Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a sister and brother-in-law that are
                             partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the provision of any services to the Group and
                             its subsidiaries, and this matter has not impacted our independence. Also, the firm, its partners and employees
                             deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the
                             Company and its subsidiaries. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

Audit materiality            We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements of the
                             Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
                             knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also
                             assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or
                             influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the
                             scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Key audit matters            Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
                             of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
                             our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
                             not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Other information                The directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the other information. The other information
                                 comprises the information in the Annual Report that accompanies the consolidated financial statements and
                                 the audit report as well as the Climate-related Disclosures Report FY25.
                                 Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
                                 express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
                                 Our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the
                                 consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
                                 materially misstated. If so, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’                       The directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the preparation and fair presentation of the
responsibilities for the         consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as the
consolidated financial           directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
statements                       from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
                                 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for
                                 assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
                                 concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
                                 Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
for the audit of the             whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
consolidated financial           includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
statements                       conducted in accordance with ISAs and ISAs (NZ) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
                                 Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
                                 they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
                                 consolidated financial statements.
                                 A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on
                                 the External Reporting Board’s website at:

                                 we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
                                 report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume

Sustainability appendix
As an integrated report we have included disclosure on our ESG performance throughout this report. Pages 10 and 11 detail our integrated
reporting value creation model, aligned to the ‘capitals’ which each align to individual sections in the report.
This report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core Option.
We publish a summary of our approach to sustainability at Spark on our website. https://www.spark.co.nz/sustainability/


Materiality
At Spark we follow the GRI materiality principle and processes (set out in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021) to identify and prioritise topics that
substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social, or economic impact. We also
consider the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR> Framework, considering whether a matter could substantively
affect Spark's ability to create value in the short, medium, or long term.
We refresh our materiality analysis annually, as part of our integrated reporting process. Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of
stakeholder feedback, review of international industry peers and sector research, and engagement with external stakeholders. In previous
years we have also engaged an external sustainability consultancy to independently review our materiality prioritisation. Internally, we consult
with a range of employees, including members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk, legal, and HR teams, to determine
Spark’s view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria.
The purpose of our annual materiality review is to ensure we are capturing all topics that are material to our stakeholders, with a particular focus
on identifying emerging topics. We have updated our materiality matrix for FY25. This reflects feedback from various stakeholders, which has
highlighted the increasing importance of data ethics, including data governance and sovereignty, with the increased profile and application of
AI technologies. In the previous year, changes included increasing the importance of disaster crisis response and the role of digital technology
in addressing sustainability challenges.
Our materiality matrix maps our material topics, with our assessment of the significance of economic, environmental and social impacts
mapped on the horizontal ‘x’ axis, and the scale of influence on stakeholder assessments and decisions mapped on the ‘y’ vertical axis,
reflecting feedback and questions received from stakeholders related to our ESG reporting.
