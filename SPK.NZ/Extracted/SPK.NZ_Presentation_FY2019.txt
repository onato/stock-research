Strategic and operational execution delivering excellent financial and market
share results. On track to achieve key EBITDAI margin and dividend aspirations

EBITDAI of $1,090m, up $109m or 11.1% on reported prior year EBITDAI, and towards the top-end

• Excluding $49m of Quantum implementation costs incurred during FY18, EBITDAI was up $60m
   or 5.8% on prior year

management, increased EBITDAI was underpinned by $109m or 4.3% reduction in total reported
operating expenses delivering a 3.1pp increase in EBITDAI margin to 30.9%

year NPAT. EBITDAI growth partially offset by:
• Net investment income decline of $33m; FY19 Southern Cross dividend of $15m as projected -
  down $35m on prior year;
• Increase in finance expenses of $8m or 10.4% on higher average net debt; and
• Increase in tax expenses of $30m or 21.4% due to increased earnings and the impact of lower
  investment income
                                                                                                                                                            $44m
In line with expectation, net debt growth moderated during H2 - up a further $26m - resulting in                                                             12.1%

Revenue classification changes

As part of the adoption of the Agile business model, the management of certain product lines have been reallocated from one part of the business to
another. The details of the key changes and the associated impact on revenue reporting are as follows:

Product name             Services provided                      Previous category            New category
Cellphone insurance      Insurance coverage for accidental loss Other operating revenue      Mobile service revenue
                         or damage to purchased Mobile
                         devices
VoIP revenue             Provision of voice services over an     Voice calling revenue       Voice access revenue
                         internet based connection
Value added voice        Additional services over a voice line   Voice calling revenue       Other voice revenue
services                 such as call diversion, caller
                         identification and other smartphone
                         services
Managed internet         Provision of internet services for a    Broadband revenue           Managed data revenue
                         managed data network

Additionally, the split of revenues between cloud, security and service management and procurement and partners has also been reviewed. The
majority of reallocation relates to the treatment of revenue from subsidiaries.

Analysis & KPI's - Capital expenditure depreciation and amortisation

On adoption of NZ IFRS 16 Leases , assets associated with capacity arrangements which were previously recognised

Spark’s definition of capital expenditure. Total depreciation on property plant and equipment, depreciation on
capacity right-of-use assets and amortisation of intangibles is reconciled below:
