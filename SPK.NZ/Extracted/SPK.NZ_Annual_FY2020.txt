Helping Kiwis stay
connected during COVID-19.
COVID-19 has challenged so much of what Kiwis have always held
dear. This year, suddenly separated from the daily interactions that
we treasure, we did what we’ve never done before: we discovered
new and powerful ways to stay connected digitally with those who
matter to us. We kept our distance, and yet we seemed more
together as a nation than many other parts of the world.
                          During lockdown we have been reminded that as a ‘lifeline utility’
                          the role we play in keeping people connected is incredibly important.
                          For most Kiwis, almost every interaction with the outside world has been
                          enabled by a phone or internet connection. COVID-19 has been the
                          biggest test of our infrastructure as Kiwis moved to work, learn and be
                          entertained at home. Years of sustained investment to build capacity into
                          our network has meant that New Zealand has been well served at a time
                          when telecommunications services truly became an essential service.

About this report
We are evolving our approach to reporting to show a more integrated view of our performance
across financial and non-financial measures. Our 2019 Annual Report combined our financial
statements with non-financial performance measures, adopting the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) Standards, the most widely used global sustainability reporting standard.
This year’s report is a further evolution and is our first integrated report. Integrated reporting
considers the creation of value over the short, medium and long term, thinking holistically
about the resources and relationships the organisation uses or affects, and the dependencies
and trade-offs between them as value is created.
The report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and the GRI Core
Option. We have not sought external assurance for the non-financial information in this report.
This report covers the activities of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries. The report is
for the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020. This report is dated 26 August 2020 and is signed
on behalf of the Board of Spark New Zealand Limited by Justine Smyth, Chair and Charles
Sitch, Chair, Audit and Risk Management Committee.

Diversity and inclusion
Spark’s Māori Strategy
Our Māori Strategy is about cultural
transformation, finding the shared space
between Te Ao Māori and the corporate
world. It aims to build deeper more authentic
partnerships with our communities, our
customers and our people. More information
is included in our community section on
page 39.
Blue Heart programme
Our Blue Heart programme supports Spark’s
focus on a ‘heart-led’ approach to diversity
and inclusion. It has evolved to be an icon for
our wider approach to an inclusive and
heart-led culture and our move to an Agile
way of operating has helped us accelerate
this shift. This approach has been
instrumental in bringing together multi-
functional squads across diverse cultural,
ethnic and professional backgrounds.
Spark Pride
As a Rainbow Tick accredited company,
we are incredibly proud of our ongoing                    New Christchurch office
commitment to the Rainbow community.
We continued our support of the Rainbow
community over the year, signing up as a
major partner of Auckland Pride 2020 and
launching the Pride & Spark Empowerment
Initiative. The Initiative helped connect and
resource Auckland’s diverse rainbow
communities by supporting those producing
events for the festival. Support includes
workshops, access to mentors and funding.
We also continued our ongoing support of
OUTLine NZ, a national charity that offers a
free support line for members of the
LGBTQIA+ community and their friends and
family. As part of the partnership we launched
a new film focusing on recruitment of those
within the LGBTQIA+ whānau. The film is a
reminder for employers that individuality is a
strength that should be welcomed, and that

reach out to play a role in building healthy,

is how we create value and build social and

We know that the impact of COVID-19 will be
felt across New Zealand and that some
communities will be more impacted than
others. The role of digital technology in
New Zealand’s recovery and transformation
brings the issue of digital equity into the
spotlight. We want a positive digital future in
which every Kiwi has the opportunity to thrive.

to address barriers to digital equity. The

Cost optimisation while maintaining
operational standards
While executing net cost reduction is a
strength for Spark, it needs to be done safely
so that operational delivery standards for
customers are maintained. Inherent risks
include unintended consequences from
initiatives, brand reputation damage and
accelerated regulatory intervention. To
mitigate this risk, the Leadership Squad has
established a formal delivery structure. This
structure includes strong governance and all
initiatives using road-tested execution
methodologies. Trajectory toward targets is
measured, which in turn enables intervention
and course corrections when required.

  1.3 Significant transactions and events in the financial year (continued)

 Impact of COVID-19
 On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organisation declared a global pandemic due to the outbreak of COVID-19. On 25 March 2020
 New Zealand entered Government-directed Alert-Level 4 lockdown resulting in the shut down in all but essential services until 27 April
 2020. The supply of telecommunications and digital services is considered an essential service therefore Spark was able to continue
 trading throughout all alert levels, with restrictions around retail stores.
 The table below provides an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on Spark’s statement of financial position.

 ITEM                                   COVID-19 ASSESSMENT                                                                                NOTE
 Cash                                   No impact to the carrying value held.
 Receivables and                        Spark has recognised an additional $6 million expected credit loss provision primarily driven by   3.1
 prepayments                            the additional risk arising from forecasts in future economic conditions. Contract assets have
                                        been reviewed for impairment in respect of contracts that may become onerous as a result of
                                        COVID-19 and none have been identified.
 Inventories                            Content rights in relation to events postponed due to COVID-19 and goods held for resale are       3.2
                                        not considered to be impaired at balance date.
 Long-term investments                  Where investments are accounted for at fair value the carrying value reflects the share price at   3.3
                                        balance date. All remaining investments are equity accounted for. No investments are
                                        considered impaired as a result of COVID-19.
 Property, plant and                    Spark’s assets are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. Spark has not identified any        3.6
 equipment                              indicators that these assets are impaired as a result of COVID-19.
 Intangible assets                      Spark has performed an impairment assessment of goodwill using a COVID-19 adjusted                 3.7
                                        forecast. No impairment was recognised following this assessment.
 Lease liabilities                      As a result of COVID-19 Spark received a number of rent concessions. Spark has elected, as a       4.2
                                        practical expedient under NZ IFRS 16, not to assess whether particular rent concessions
                                        occurring as a direct consequence of COVID-19 are lease modifications and instead accounted
                                        for those rent concessions directly in the statement of profit or loss.
 Debt                                   Debt is held at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging       4.3
                                        relationship, adjustments for fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged. Interest
                                        rates and foreign exchange rates have been impacted by COVID-19 and reflected in the
                                        carrying value at balance date.
 Derivative financial                   COVID-19 has impacted interest rates, foreign exchange rates and electricity prices. Derivatives   5.1
 instruments                            are recorded at fair value; the carrying value reflects these changes at balance date.

Section 2 Financial performance information

2.1 Segment information

The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how Spark reviews its performance.
Spark’s segments are measured based on product margin, which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs.
The segment result excludes other gains, labour, operating expenses, depreciation and amortisation, net investment income, finance
income and expense and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall Group level by the Chief Executive.

Comparative segment results                                                                                                                      2
Spark has reclassified the comparative segment results to reflect minor changes in the management of videoconferencing and other
collaboration services from voice to managed data, networks and services. There is no change to the overall Spark reported result because
of these changes.

 Notes to the financial statements: Financial performance information


 2.2 Operating revenues and other gains

 The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

 Contracts with customers
 Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
 1. Identify the contract with a customer;
 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
 3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer;
 4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling
    prices; and
 5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
 Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
 service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
 service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
 resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price
 and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
 Where contracts require the customer to commit to a minimum level of service or a minimum monthly payment amount that cannot be
 decreased without terminating the contract, revenue is allocated to performance obligations using the minimum enforceable rights and
 obligations and any excess amount is recognised as revenue as it is earned.
 Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
 control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. These services are typically provided, and thus
 recognised, on a monthly basis. Control of products is typically transferred when the customer has physical possession of the goods. The
 nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

 PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS                                                 TIMING OF SATISFACTION

 Usage, other optional or non-subscription services, and pay-per-        As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid on a

 Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods                  When control is passed to the customer, generally when the
                                                                         customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in
                                                                         packages or on interest-free terms, customers usually pay in equal
                                                                         instalments over 6 to 36 months.
 Installation or set-up services (where distinct)                        As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid following the
                                                                         provision of the service.

 Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service
 management contracts. Contracts with significant payment terms include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-free
 payment terms of greater than 12 months.

 Notes to the financial statements: Financial performance information


 2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)


       Key estimates and assumptions
       Determining the transaction price
       Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
       entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
       is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.
       We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within that
       product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value of
       money. The expected value or most likely amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount where
       it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction price. In
       making this determination, consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as well as
       factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience with similar
       types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations, as well
       as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives,
       penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.

       Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
       Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
       performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative
       stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the
       observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar
       customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into account
       reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of customer. In
       determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum
       enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as
       revenue as they are earned.

       Distinct goods and services
       We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
       individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
       items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products
       and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.

       Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
       We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the
       methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Revenue for performance
       obligations satisfied over time is recognised using the resources consumed by customers method or the time-elapsed method,
       as these best depict the transfer of goods or services to customers. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in
       time is recognised when control of the good or service is transferred to the customer, which is typically when the customer takes
       possession of the good.

2.5 Non-GAAP measures

Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’). Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in
the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate
performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they
should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not
uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the telecommunications industry.
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
expenses and impairments) greater than $25 million. There are no adjusting items for the years ended 30 June 2020 or 30 June 2019.
                                                                                                                                                        2
Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment
income (EBITDAI)
Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back depreciation and amortisation, finance expense and income tax expense and subtracting finance
income and net investment income (which includes dividend income and Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint
ventures) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with,
those presented in these financial statements.

Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure is the additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill, acquisitions and other
non-cash additions that may be required by NZ IFRS, such as decommissioning costs) and additions to capacity right-of-use assets where
such additions are paid up front.

  Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
  receivables is estimated to be $163 million (30 June 2019: $255 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
  amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value because of the short term to maturity.

 Contract assets
 Contract assets primarily relate to Spark’s rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting date.
 Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. The following summarises significant changes in
 those balances:

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

Contract costs
Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract (such as commission costs) and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be
recovered and are therefore initially deferred and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is consistent
with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises significant changes in
those balances:

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the costs we incur to obtain or fulfil a contract that meet the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires us to make
     significant judgements. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise
     the costs within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer
     tenure for consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.

 3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

 Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
 loss provision for trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and other receivables. The
 calculation of the allowance provision incorporates forward-looking information, such as forecasted economic conditions.
 The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                                     CURRENT      ≤ 1 MONTH     > 1 MONTH            TOTAL

  The expected credit loss provision prior to assessing the impacts of COVID-19 reduced by $5 million to $25 million due to lower
  receivable balances which in turn reduced the provision level required. At 30 June 2020 an additional $6 million expected credit loss
  provision was recognised primarily due to forecasted changes in unemployment rates and gross domestic product in New Zealand
  resulting from COVID-19. As a result, the expected credit loss provision increased by a net $1 million during the year to $31 million.

  The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of
  recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could
  generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be
  subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.


       Key estimates and assumptions
       The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
       rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
       impairment calculation based on Spark’s past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates
       at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
       unemployment rates and gross domestic product in New Zealand.

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

Finance lease receivables
Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in
Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore
shown as a net finance lease receivable on the statement of financial position.
In addition, Spark sub-leases a number of office building floors. Where sub-leases are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable term
of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.
The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

The leases with Chorus have multiple rights of renewal and the full lease terms have been used in the calculation of the net financial lease
receivable, as it is likely that due to the specialised nature of the buildings, the leases will be renewed to the maximum terms.

Content rights inventory
Spark enters into contracts for the right to stream digital content for sport and previously to subscribers of Lightbox. Content rights are
stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less accumulated amortisation and includes prepaid content that is not yet available
for broadcast.
The amortisation of content rights is recognised within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their licence periods or, for live
sports content, over its broadcast period. The content rights amortisation charge for the year ended 30 June 2020 was $40 million (30 June
2019: $24 million).

3.4 Right-of-use assets

Spark is a lessee for a large number of leases, including:
• Property – Spark leases a number of office buildings and retail stores. These leases generally have rights of renewal that are reasonably
  certain to be exercised and therefore may have long effective lease terms;
• Capacity arrangements – Spark enters into a number of indefeasible right of use capacity arrangements for cable capacity;
• Mobile sites – Spark has entered into a number of agreements to allow the operation of mobile network infrastructure throughout
  New Zealand;
• Motor vehicles – Spark leases motor vehicles for use in sales, field operations and maintenance of infrastructure equipment; and
• Other – Spark leases equipment that is held at Spark premises and used to provide services to customers.

Spark New Zealand Annual Report 2020 Notes to the financial statements




 Notes to the financial statements: Assets


 3.4 Right-of-use assets (continued)


       Key estimates and assumptions
       At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the
       contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess
       whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
       • The contract involves the use of an identified asset;
       • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
       • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset.
       At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
       to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
       commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
       adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate
       of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any
       lease incentives received.
       The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
       the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are
       determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for
       impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.



 3.5 Leased customer equipment assets

 Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of back-to-back lease arrangements for customer premises
 equipment. Such arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a
 genuine sale if control of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that
 a sale does not occur as control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor.
 Spark as the seller-lessee continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset, which is initially measured at cost. The asset is
 subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term. Movements in leased customer equipment
 assets are summarised below:

                                                                                                                                2020              2019

Spark New Zealand Annual Report 2020 Notes to the financial statements




 Notes to the financial statements: Assets


 3.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

 Joint arrangement
 Spark has entered into a joint arrangement in relation to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic submarine
 cable between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2020 the carrying value of Spark’s share of property, plant and equipment and
 intangible assets in the joint operation was $31 million (30 June 2019: $33 million).


       Key estimates and assumptions
       Spark’s property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets’
       estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires management
       judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
       obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
       The estimated useful lives of Spark’s property, plant and equipment is as follows:
       Telecommunications equipment and plant
       Junctions and trunk transmission systems                          10 – 50 years
       Switching equipment	  5 – 12 years
       Customer premises equipment	  3 – 5 years
       Airconditioning equipment                                         10 – 20 years
       Network management systems	  2 – 5 years
       Batteries	  5 – 15 years
       Power and building equipment                                      10 – 25 years
       Buildings	  9 – 50 years
       Other assets
       Motor vehicles	  6 years
       Furniture and fittings	  2 – 25 years
       Computer equipment	  3 – 5 years
       The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
       conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
       flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
       include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
       for valuing future cash flows.

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment
     annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement, including assessing the
     expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark ceasing
     to use it.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark intangible assets is as follows:
     Software	  2 – 8 years
     Spectrum licences                                                  17 – 20 years
     Other intangible assets
     Customer contracts and brands	  5 – 10 years
     Other intangible assets	  5 – 80 years

 During the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of goodwill. Headroom
 currently exists in each CGU and, based on sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions, including
 anticipated COVID-19 impact, would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.


       Key estimates and assumptions
       Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment by estimating the future cash flows, based on Board-approved business plans,
       which reflect the anticipated impact of COVID-19, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital expenditure for each
       CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU performance. The
       major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include revenue forecasts,
       operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future technology paths.
       Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 8.8% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2020 (30
       June 2019: 10.1%).

4.2 Lease liabilities (continued)


     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
     the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
     rate cannot be readily determined, Spark’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as
     the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
     Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
     • Fixed payments, including in–substance fixed payments;
     • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
       commencement date;
     • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee;
     • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise; and
     • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.
     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
     future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark’s estimate of the amount expected to
     be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or
     extension option.
     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right–of–use
     asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right–of–use asset has been reduced to zero.
     Spark has elected not to recognise right–of–use assets and lease liabilities for short–term leases that have lease terms of 12
     months or less and leases of low–value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within operating
     expenses on a straight–line basis over their lease terms.

 4.3 Debt

 Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and measured
 at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes attributable to
 the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in the statement of
 profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

 None of Spark’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark’s debt,
 however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default
 over Spark’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019.
 The fair value of long–term debt, including long-term debt due within one year, (calculated based on the present value of future
 principal and interest cash flows, discounted at market interest rates at balance date) was $1,254 million compared to a carrying value
 of $1,244 million as at 30 June 2020 (30 June 2019: fair value of $1,258 million compared to a carrying value of $1,245 million).

4.4 Capital risk management

Spark manages its capital considering shareholders’ interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board
continues to be committed to the Company maintaining a single ‘A Band’ credit rating and its capital management policies are designed
to ensure this objective is met. As part of this commitment Spark manages its debt levels to ensure that the ratio of net debt at hedged
rates (being inclusive of associated derivatives) to EBITDAI does not materially exceed 1.4 times on a long–run basis, which, for credit rating
agency purposes, Spark estimates equates approximately to adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.7 times. The difference between these two
ratios is primarily due to the credit rating agency making adjustments for leases and captive finance operations.
As at 30 June 2020 the Company’s Standard & Poor’s credit ratings for long–term and short–term debt was A– and A–2 respectively, with
outlook stable (30 June 2019: same).

Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long–term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due
to arise on maturity, plus short–term debt, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non–cash impact of fair value hedge
adjustments and any unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non–GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.

1 Net debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity and includes adjustment to state principal of foreign currency medium term notes at the hedged
  currency rate.
2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have
  no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
The dividend reinvestment plan has been reinstated for the H2 FY20 dividend after being suspended in 2015. Shares issued under the
dividend reinvestment plan will be issued at a 2% discount to the prevailing market price around the time of issue. The last date for
shareholders to elect to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan for the H2 FY20 dividend is 21 September 2020.
If shareholders previously participated in the dividend reinvestment plan they will need to re-elect to participate. Previous elections have
not been retained.

  Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and foreign
  exchange and electricity prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other
  than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 no
  derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting
  of any derivative financial instruments is $39 million (30 June 2019: was deemed immaterial).

 Hedge accounting
 Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
 the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
 Derivatives are designated:
 • Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt;
 • Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions; and
 • Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in
   cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
 At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
 instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an
 economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective
 cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the
 derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the
 hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
 Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
 ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the
 change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
 Cash flow hedges
 Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
 exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
 interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
 Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate debt
 and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency fixed-rate debt into variable rate debt.
 Electricity hedge contracts are designated in cash flow hedges to reduce electricity price risk from price fluctuations. These hedge
 contracts establish the price at which future specified quantities of electricity are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be
 paid or received is recognised as a component of electricity costs through the term of the contracts.
 Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
 12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

Other amounts deferred in equity will be transferred to the statement of profit or loss over the next five years (30 June 2019: six years).
As at 30 June 2020 the cost of hedging reserve was $2 million (30 June 2019: $1 million). The movement in the hedge reserves includes
$49 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $14 million associated deferred tax.
Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
year ended 30 June 2020 there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2019: no material
ineffectiveness).
Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian Krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark’s risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are
excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
of the debt.
The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRS is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to profit
or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.                                                                                        5

 Sensitivity to foreign currency movements                               2019: less than $3 million).
 As at 30 June 2020 a movement of 10% in the New Zealand dollar
 would (after hedging) impact the statement of profit or loss by less
 than $3 million (30 June 2019: less than $1 million) and the
 statement of changes in equity by less than $19 million (30 June
 2019: less than $16 million). This analysis assumes a movement in
 the New Zealand dollar across all currencies and only includes the
 effect of foreign exchange movements on monetary financial
 instruments.

Spark manages its exposure using a credit policy that includes
limits on exposures with significant counterparties that have been
set and approved by the Board and are monitored on a regular
basis. Spark places its cash and derivative financial instruments with                                                                                5
high-credit quality financial institutions and does not have
significant concentration of risk with any single party. Concentration
of credit risk for trade and other receivables is limited due to
Spark’s large customer base.
Spark has certain derivative and debt arrangements that are subject
to bilateral credit support agreements that require Spark or its
counterparties to post collateral funds to support the value of
certain derivatives subject to certain agreed threshold amounts.
As at 30 June 2020 no collateral was posted (30 June 2019: nil).
Letters of credit and guarantees may also be held over some
receivable amounts. The carrying amounts of financial assets
represent the maximum credit exposure.
At balance date there has been no material deterioration in Spark’s
or counterparty’s credit risk resulting from COVID-19, however,
within the market there have been minor changes in the outlook for
some banks, further deterioration could impact Spark in FY21.

Tax depreciation on buildings
On 25 March 2020 the Government enacted legislation to reintroduce tax depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings, effective
from 1 July 2020. This increases the tax base of building assets because depreciation can be claimed from FY21 onwards (previously the
tax base for building assets was zero). As deferred tax is calculated on the difference between the carrying amount of an asset and its tax
base, the increase in tax base has reduced Spark’s deferred tax liability by $10 million. This also results in a one-off decrease in tax expense
of $10 million.                                                                                                                                        6

  Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AUD$461 million at
  30 June 2020 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2019: AUD$461 million). These losses and temporary
  differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the
  production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority
  requirements.
  Spark has a nil imputation credit account as at 30 June 2020 (30 June 2019: $21 million negative balance). The imputation credit account
  had a positive balance as at 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019.


 6.2 Employee share schemes

 Spark operates share-based compensation plans that are equity settled as outlined below.

 Restricted share schemes (RSS)
 A restricted share scheme was initially introduced for selected employees in September 2001. For new allocations after August 2015 these
 were replaced by two new restricted share schemes:
 • Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme; and
 • Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long-Term Incentive Scheme.
 The Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme is for the Leadership Squad and senior leaders and delivers one scheme with the
 same set of rules under one long-term incentive, with a performance hurdle in place. The Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long-
 Term Incentive Scheme related to the previous Managing Director, Simon Moutter.
 Under these restricted share schemes ordinary shares in the Company are issued to Spark Trustee Limited. Participants purchase shares
 from Spark Trustee Limited with funds lent to them by the Company and which are held on their behalf by Spark Trustee Limited. If the
 individual is still employed by Spark at the end of the vesting period (generally three years) and applicable performance hurdles are met,
 the employee is provided a cash bonus, which must be used to repay the loan and the shares are then transferred to the individual. The
 target for this hurdle is the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually.




                                                                                                                                               94
6.2 Employee share schemes (continued)
Share option scheme
In September 2019 members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders were granted options under the
new Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Scheme. Under the scheme participants were granted options at the start of the three-year vesting
period. The number of options granted equalled the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark New Zealand
shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment, at vesting
each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark employment)
then the options simply lapse.
Vesting of the September 2019 LTI grant is contingent on: participants’ continued employment with Spark through to September 2022;
and the Company achieving a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance hurdle. TSR is a measure of share price appreciation and
dividends paid over the three-year period of the grant. The target for this hurdle is the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding
annually. Options with an intrinsic value of $5 million remain outstanding at year end and have a weighed average remaining life of
2.2 years.
Information regarding shares and options awarded under these schemes is as follows:

Closing balance as at 30 June                                                            998,125      1,086,461              –   1,755,862

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments is recognised as an expense, with a
corresponding entry in equity. The total charge recognised for these schemes for the year ended 30 June 2020 was $1.8 million (30 June
2019: $2.0 million) and the expense relating to the restricted shares schemes was $1.4 million (30 June 2019: $2.0 million). As at 30 June
2020, $2.1 million of share scheme awards remain unvested and not expensed (30 June 2019: $2.9 million). This expense, measured at its
fair value based on a valuation model, will be recognised over the remaining vesting period of the awards.
Spark Share, an employee share purchase scheme, does not have a material impact on these financial statements.

                                             Basis for opinion
                             We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). We
                             believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
                             We are independent of the group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of
                             Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (Including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the
                             New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
                             Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
                             Standards) (‘IESBA Code’), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
                             requirements and the IESBA Code.
                             Our responsibilities under ISAs (NZ) are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
                             consolidated financial statements section of our report.
                             Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to regulatory audit, other assurance-related
                             services (such as trustee reporting) and taxation consulting services. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and
                             employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities
                             of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as auditor of the group. The firm
                             has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.

                             Materiality
               The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Materiality helped us to determine the
               nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
               and on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The materiality for the consolidated financial
               statements as a whole was set at $26 million determined with reference to a benchmark of group earnings
               before income tax. We chose the benchmark because, in our view, this is a key measure of the group's
               performance.



                             Key audit matters
               Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
               of the consolidated financial statements in the current period. We summarise below those matters and our key
               audit procedures to address those matters in order that the shareholders as a body may better understand the
               process by which we arrived at our audit opinion. Our procedures were undertaken in the context of and solely
               for the purpose of our statutory audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole and we do not
               express discrete opinions on separate elements of the consolidated financial statements.

               Key changes in the assessment of audit risks
               COVID-19
               The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional risks across a number of areas of the business, particularly the
               recoverability of receivables. All forward-looking assumptions are inherently more uncertain during these
               unprecedented times. While the key audit matter "Revenue recognition" detailed below, is unchanged from last
               year, the underlying audit risk has increased which impacted the extent and nature of audit evidence that we had
               to gather. We also draw attention to Note 1.3 of the consolidated financial statements which describes the
               impact of the COVID-19 on the business.

               The key audit matter                                     How the matter was addressed in our audit

                        Other information
          The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for the other information included in the entity’s Annual

          assurance conclusion thereon.
          In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
          information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
          consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears materially
          misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
          other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

          This independent auditor’s report is made solely to the shareholders as a body. Our audit work has been
          undertaken so that we might state to the shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in the

                                  Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial
                                  statements
                    The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for:
                    — the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
                         accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
                         Reporting Standards) and International Financial Reporting Standards;
                    — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a set of consolidated financial
                         statements that is fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
                    — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related
                         to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
                         cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.



                                  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
                                  statements
                    Our objective is:
                    — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
                         from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
                    — to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
                    Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
                    with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
                    Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
                    they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
                    consolidated financial statements.
                    A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of these consolidated financial statements is located at

1 The figures shown are gross amounts and exclude GST (where applicable) and are rounded to the nearest dollar.
2 This table excludes contributions towards medical and life insurance of a total of $7,090. Spark meets costs incurred by directors that are incidental to the performance of their duties.
  This includes providing New Zealand-based directors with mobile phones and $120 per month home phone account credits and overseas-based directors with $400 per month
  phone allowances. Spark also meets the costs of directors’ Spark-related travel. As these costs are incurred by Spark to enable directors to perform their duties, no value is attributable
  to them as benefits to directors for the purposes of the above table.

 shares are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019.

 All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or, in
 the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive
 director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as at
 the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased within a
 three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, within a three-year period from that
 date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the aggregate sale price for all
 shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

Stakeholder engagement
Spark engages with a broad range of stakeholders as detailed in the table below. We have also engaged a small number of stakeholders

 Material issues
 To prioritise Spark’s reporting on sustainability topics we have followed GRI’s materiality principle (set out in GRI 101) to identify and prioritise
 topics which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social or economic
 impact.
 Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of stakeholder feedback, review of industry peers and interviews with external stakeholders.
 Internally we consult with a range of employees, including members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk, legal and HR
 teams, to determine Spark’s view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria.
 In FY20 we have reviewed and updated our list of material impacts, taking into account new and emerging issues particularly related to the
 impact of COVID-19. This has prioritised our role to support economic recovery, and highlighted the importance of investment in resilient and
 adaptable infrastructure. We have also followed the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR> Framework,
 considering whether a matter could substantively affect Spark’s ability to create value in the short, medium or long term.
