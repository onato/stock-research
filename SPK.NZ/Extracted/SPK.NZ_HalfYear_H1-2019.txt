NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with                            material changes on adoption of NZ IFRS 15 by
customers (NZ IFRS 15) replaces NZ IAS 18                         Spark are summarised by revenue type below.
Revenue and related interpretations and is                        i) Mobile revenue
effective from the current financial year, being
the year ending 30 June 2019. Spark has                           The majority of Spark’s consumer pay-monthly
elected to transition to NZ IFRS 15 using the full                mobile contracts are ‘open-term’, however some
retrospective method which applies the                            customers have contracts with a fixed contract
standard retrospectively to prior reporting                       term, such as 24 months. These contracts
periods, subject to the permitted and following                   generally include device subsidies, which can

1. in respect of completed contracts, Spark has                   NZ IAS 18, Spark recognised revenue from
   not restated contracts that: (i) begin and end                 arrangements with multiple elements in a
   within the same annual reporting period; or                    manner that is similar to the requirements of
   (ii) were completed contracts at the                           NZ IFRS 15, based on previous industry
   beginning of the earliest period presented;                    guidance for the telecommunications sector
2. in respect of completed contracts that have                    available for these transactions. There has
   variable consideration, Spark used the                         therefore not been a material acceleration of
   transaction price at the date the contract was                 device revenue on adoption of NZ IFRS 15 and
   completed rather than estimating variable                      this may differ to other telecommunications

   periods;                                                       is allocated with reference to the stand-alone
3. for contracts that were modified before the                    selling prices and the allocation of revenue to
   beginning of the earliest period presented,                    distinct goods or services (performance
   Spark has not retrospectively restated the                     obligations) varies from the previous allocation
   contract for those modifications. Instead,                     which was based on relative fair value.
   Spark has reflected the aggregate effect of                    Spark provides customers the ability to obtain
   all of the modifications that occur before the                 devices on an ‘interest free’ device repayment

                          Basis for conclusion
          A review of interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 Review of Financial
          Statements Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“NZ SRE 2410”) is a limited assurance
          engagement. The auditor performs procedures, consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
          for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
          As the auditor of Spark New Zealand Limited, NZ SRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical
          requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial statements.
          Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to regulatory audit, other assurance related
          services (such as trustee reporting) and compliance services. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and
          employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading
          activities of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as reviewer of the
          group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.



                          Use of this Independent Review Report
          This report is made solely to the shareholders as a body. Our review work has been undertaken so that we
          might state to the shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in the Independent Review
          Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
          responsibility to anyone other than the shareholders as a body for our review work, this report, or any of the
          opinions we have formed.

                 Responsibilities of the Directors for the interim consolidated financial
          statements
          The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for:
          — the preparation and fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ
              IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting;
          — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of interim consolidated financial
              statements that are fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
          — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related
              to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
              cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.



                  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the review of the interim consolidated
          financial statements
          Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements based on our
          review. We conducted our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410. NZ SRE 2410 requires us to conclude
          whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim consolidated financial
          statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
          The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in
          accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Accordingly we do not express an audit
          opinion on these interim financial statements.
