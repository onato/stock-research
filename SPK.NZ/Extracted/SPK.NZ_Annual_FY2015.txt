Total capital expenditure from continuing operations for FY15 was $576 million, an increase of $117 million, or 25.5%, on FY14. This was
primarily due to a $158 million investment in 700 MHz spectrum and a $9 million increase in major programmes, partly offset by lower
spend in other areas due to increased capital efficiency.

Working capital and net tangible assets

Working capital
Spark New Zealand defines its working capital as the difference between current assets and current liabilities, excluding assets and
liabilities classified as held for sale. Spark New Zealand’s working capital position is shown in the table below. As at 30 June 2015 current
liabilities exceeded current assets, however, positive operating cash flows enable working capital to be managed to meet short-term
liabilities as they fall due. As at 30 June 2014 there was a surplus in working capital, with current assets exceeding current liabilities.

                                                                                       2015                    2014

Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards) and International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due
to fraud or error.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the group’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, as well as evaluating the presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to regulatory audit and other assurance related services.
Subject to certain restrictions, partners and employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the
ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as
auditor of the group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.

Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 46 to 81 comply with generally accepted accounting practice
in New Zealand and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Spark New Zealand Limited
as at 30 June 2015 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.

NOTE 3 Significant transactions and events
for the current year
The following significant and one-off transactions and events
affected the financial performance and financial position of the
Group for the year ended 30 June 2015:
• A 1 December 2014 change to the Telecommunications Act
  2001 resulted in unbundled bitstream access (UBA) becoming
  the primary service purchased from Chorus, resulting in
  Chorus now charging the Group’s Spark Wholesale customers
  directly for layer 1 copper access, where it bundles the voice
  service sold by Spark Wholesale with a broadband service to
  its customers. The Group therefore no longer recognises the
  revenue or costs associated with access charges for these
  Wholesale customers. This resulted in a $52 million reduction
  in access revenue and a corresponding decrease in payments
  to telecommunications operators for the seven months from
  1 December 2014 to 30 June 2015;
• The Group sold its international voice business, TCNZ Cook
  Islands Limited (which held the Group’s 60% share of Telecom
  Cook Islands Limited) and Telecom Rentals Limited, resulting
  in total gains on sale of $32 million. The sale of Telecom
  Rentals Limited resulted in the derecognition of significant
  finance lease receivable balances which totalled $121 million
  as at 30 June 2014;
• The Group acquired Appserv Limited for cash consideration
  of $17 million on 1 July 2014. The acquisition has revenue,
  cost and capital synergies that allow the Group to gain
  cost-efficient and effective access to additional specialised
  Cloud capabilities. Goodwill recognised on acquisition
  was $9 million;

NOTE 5 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to the Group’s key operating revenues and other gains are outlined below.
• For services billed on a monthly basis, unbilled revenue from the billing cycle date to the end of each month is recognised as
  revenue during the month the service is provided and is deferred in respect of the portion of fixed monthly charges that have
  been billed in advance.
• Revenue from the sale of prepaid mobile credit is initially deferred, with recognition occurring when the prepaid credit is used
  by the customer.
• Where multiple products or services are bundled together on sale, revenue is allocated to each element in proportion to its fair
  value and recognised as appropriate for that element. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is not contingent on the
  provision or delivery of a future service.
• Revenue from contractual arrangements, including contracts to design and build ICT solutions, is recognised by reference to
  the stage of completion method when the outcome of the arrangement can be estimated reliably. The Group uses appropriate
  measures of the stage of completion, such as services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed or the
  proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. When the outcome of a transaction, or
  achievement of milestones, cannot be estimated reliably and it is not probable that the costs incurred will be recovered, revenue
  is not recognised and the costs incurred are recognised as an expense.
• Revenue from interconnect fees is recognised at the time the services are performed. In the course of its normal business
  operations, the Group interconnects its networks with other telecommunications operators. In some instances management may
  be required to estimate levels of traffic flows between networks to determine amounts receivable or payable for interconnection.

The Group has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to A$465 million
at 30 June 2015 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of the applicable tax jurisdiction (30 June 2014: A$461 million). These
losses and temporary differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation
is contingent on the relevant subsidiaries producing taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance
with the relevant taxation authority requirements.

Imputation credits available for use in subsequent reporting periods are $30 million (30 June 2014: $46 million).


NOTE 8 Property, plant and equipment
The value of property, plant and equipment purchased from the Government was determined using deemed cost as at 1 April 1987.
Subsequent additions are recognised at cost. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write down the cost of property,
plant and equipment to its estimated residual value over its estimated useful life, which is outlined in the table below.

NOTE 9­ Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business
combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. The cost of acquiring an intangible asset with a finite life is amortised from
the date the underlying asset is ready for use, on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is outlined in the table below.

1 Goodwill of $9 million was recognised on acquisition of Appserv Limited on 1 July 2014. See note 26.

An impairment loss is recorded if the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of
each CGU was calculated on the basis of value in use using a discounted cash flow model. Future cash flows were projected for one
year, based on Board-approved business plans, with key assumptions being earnings and capital expenditure for the CGU based on
forecasts of expected future performance. The forecasted financial information is based on both past experience and future
expectations of CGU performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require
judgement include revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth
rates and future technology paths.
Nil terminal growth was applied and a pre-tax discount rate of 12% (30 June 2014: 12%) was utilised. The growth rate applied does
not exceed the observed long-term historical average growth rate for relevant markets/sectors.
During the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 no impairment arose as a result of the review of goodwill. Headroom
currently exists in each CGU and, based on sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would
cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.

NOTE 10 Long-term investments (continued)
All investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method. None are considered to be individually
material. The Group’s share of profit or loss is presented within the income statement, with the exception of Pacific Carriage Holdings
Limited and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited. For these entities the Group has stopped recognising its share of the
associates’ losses, as their carrying value has been reduced to nil and the Group has no obligation to fund their deficits or repay
dividends. As at 30 June 2015 the Group has recognised cumulative dividend income of $799 million (30 June 2014: $746 million)
from these associates and the share of the cumulative deficits was $630 million (30 June 2014: $493 million). The Group’s share of
profits not recognised for the year was $52 million (30 June 2014: $27 million).
Changes in the aggregate carrying amount of the Group’s investment in associates and joint ventures is as follows:

Trade receivables, finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables are financial instruments and held at amortised cost.
The fair value of finance lease receivables is estimated to be $60 million (30 June 2014: $231 million) using a discount rate based
on the relevant swap rate, given the tenure of the lease and adding a credit margin that reflects the credit quality of the receivables.
The carrying amount of all other receivables are approximately equivalent to their fair value because of the short term to maturity.
The Group has $61 million (30 June 2014: $60 million) of financial assets that are overdue but not impaired. Trade receivables are
aged as follows:

Notes to the financial statements
NOTE 11 Receivables and prepayments (continued)
The Group maintains a provision for estimated losses expected to arise from customers being unable to make required payments.
This provision takes into account known commercial factors impacting specific customer accounts, as well as the overall profile of the
Group’s receivables portfolio. In assessing the provision, factors such as past collection history, the age of receivable balances, the
level of activity in customer accounts, as well as general macro-economic trends, are taken into account. Significant changes in these
factors would likely necessitate changes in the doubtful debts provision.
Movements in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows:

                                                                                                                       2015         2014

Bad debt expenses are reported as other operating expenses in the income statement and written off against the provision for
doubtful debts in the period in which it is determined that the debts are uncollectable. If those debts are subsequently collected
then a gain is recognised in the income statement.

General inventory
General inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after consideration for excess and obsolete items. The cost is
determined on a weighted average cost basis and amounts are removed from inventory on this basis. The cost of inventories includes
the transfer from equity of any foreign exchange gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges related to inventories.
The allowance for general inventory obsolescence as at 30 June 2015 was $7 million (30 June 2014: $6 million) with $1 million
charged to the income statement during the period (30 June 2014: $1 million).

Content rights inventory
The Group enters into contracts for the rights to stream digital content to subscribers of its Lightbox service. Content is licensed for
a fixed fee for the term of the licence agreement and this may span more than one year. The non-current portion of content rights
inventory is $12 million. Content rights are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less accumulated amortisation.
The amortisation of content rights is recognised within operating expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over its
licence period. The content rights amortisation charge for the year ended 30 June 2015 was $14 million (30 June 2014: nil).
Payments made for content rights before the commencement of the related licence period are classified within prepaid content rights.

None of the Group’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over the Group’s
debt, however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no
events of default over the Group’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014.
The fair value of long-term debt (calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at
market interest rates at balance date) was $724 million compared to a carrying value of $692 million (30 June 2014: fair value of
$663 million compared to a carrying value of $651 million).

Euro Medium Term Notes
Euro Medium Term Notes of $92 million have been issued with maturity dates of 14 May 2018 and 6 April 2020, with coupon rates
of 5.6% and 5.8% respectively before hedging. Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps have been entered into
to hedge the related currency and interest rate risk.

TeleBonds
The Group has issued bonds (TeleBonds) to institutional and retail investors. These have been issued as compounding, income or
zero coupon bonds. TeleBonds have effective interest rates ranging from 7.0% to 7.8% and maturity dates between March 2016 and
April 2016. During the year ended 30 June 2015, $73 million of TeleBonds matured and were repaid (30 June 2014: $3 million).

Domestic notes
As at 30 June 2015 the Group had $350 million of notes issued in New Zealand with maturity dates of 25 October 2019 and
25 March 2022 (30 June 2014: $250 million with a maturity date of 25 October 2019). The notes are unsecured and pay coupon
rates of 5.25% and 4.50% respectively.

Bank funding
The Group has a $100 million unsecured variable bank facility with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd, maturing in March 2018.
The facility was fully drawn at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014.

NOTE 19 Derivatives
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date they are entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated
as a hedging instrument and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair values of derivatives are as follows:

                                                                                                                                 2015    2014

As at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 no derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement
of financial position. The potential for offsetting of any derivative financial instruments is immaterial.
The Group’s derivatives are classified as being within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of interest rate swaps is
calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. The fair value of forward foreign
exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back
to present value.

Notes to the financial statements
NOTE 19 Derivatives (continued)

Cash flow hedges
During the period all hedged forecast transactions occurred as expected and qualified for hedge accounting.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps used to manage interest and foreign exchange risk on debt are jointly
designated as cash flow hedges of the forecast interest and principal cash flows of the debt. The changes in the fair values of interest
rate derivatives accumulated in equity are expected to be reclassified to finance expense as interest payments occur over the
remaining term of the derivatives. As at 30 June 2015 the fair value component of interest rate derivatives deferred in equity, by
maturity, is $1 million two to three years, $4 million four to five years and $(9) million over five years (30 June 2014: $7 million three
to four years and $4 million over five years).
The Group also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency purchases. The majority of the purchases are
forecast to be made within 12 months of 30 June 2015 (30 June 2014: within12 months of 30 June 2014). When in a hedging
relationship, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts will be included in the income statement at the same time as the
underlying purchase impacts the determination of income. If the purchase relates to an operating expense, the fair value will be
recognised when the underlying expense is recognised. If the purchase relates to an item of property, plant and equipment or
intangible assets, the fair value will be recognised in the income statement as the asset depreciates or is amortised. If the purchase
relates to an inventory item, the fair value will be recognised in the income statement when the underlying inventory is expensed.
Other amounts deferred in equity will be transferred to the income statement over the next seven years (30 June 2014: six years).
A reconciliation of movements in the cash flow hedge reserve follows:

Fair value hedges
As at 30 June 2015 the Group had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. The gain or loss from remeasuring both the
hedging instrument and the hedged items at fair value is recognised in the income statement.
During the year ended 30 June 2015 the Group recognised an immaterial gain on fair value hedges (30 June 2014: nil) and an
immaterial loss on hedged exposures (30 June 2014: nil). There has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging
relationships during the year.


NOTE 20 Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk) liquidity risk and credit
risk. The Group manages its treasury activities through a Board-approved treasury constitution consisting of treasury governance
and policy frameworks.

Financial market risk
The Group is exposed to financial market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group employs risk management strategies, including the use of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, forward exchange
contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps, to manage these exposures.
                                                                                                                                 Page 71




NOTE 20 Financial risk management (continued)
The Group monitors the use of derivative financial instruments through the use of well-defined market and credit risk limits and
timely reports to senior management. All contracts have been entered into with major creditworthy financial institutions. The risk
associated with these transactions is that the fair value or cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market
rates, coupled with the cost of replacing these agreements at the current market rates in the event of default by the counterparty.
The Group is also subject to equity price risk in relation to long-term investments in listed companies.

a) Currency risk
The Group’s primary objective in managing foreign currency risk is to protect against the risk that the eventual New Zealand dollar
net cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To do this the Group enters into forward
exchange contracts to reduce its foreign currency exposures.
Capital and operational expenditure in foreign currencies that are highly probable may be hedged. Exposures with amounts and
timing that are less than certain may be proportionately hedged, based on certain benchmarks.
A portion of the Group’s long-term debt has been issued in foreign currency under its Euro Medium Term Note programme. The
Group enters into cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the foreign currency borrowings into a floating rate New Zealand
dollar exposure. All debt not denominated in New Zealand dollars is hedged. Debt denominated in foreign currencies is translated
to New Zealand dollars, with currency translation recognised in the income statement. These movements are offset by the translation
of the principal value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Group’s exposure to monetary foreign currency financial instruments is outlined below:

dollar across all currencies and only includes the effect of foreign exchange movements on monetary financial instruments.

Notes to the financial statements
NOTE 20 Financial risk management (continued)
b) Interest rate risk
The Group employs the use of derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency borrowings into floating-rate New Zealand
dollar positions.
Interest rate swaps are used to convert certain floating-rate positions into fixed-rate positions and vice versa. As a consequence, the
Group’s interest rate positions are limited to New Zealand yield curves. The Group’s objective in relation to interest rate risk
management is to minimise the cost of net borrowings and to minimise the impact of interest rate movements on the Group’s interest
expense and net earnings within policies approved by the Board.
As at 30 June 2015 a movement in interest rates of 100 basis points would impact the income statement and statement of changes in
equity (after hedging) by less than $14 million (30 June 2014: $8 million).

c) Equity price risk
The Group’s exposure to equity price risk as at 30 June 2015 from its investment in the listed company Hutchison was $114 million
(30 June 2014: $99 million). The Group manages its exposure to equity price risk through regular reviews of the investee’s current
and projected performance. As at 30 June 2015 a 10% movement in the quoted price of shares in Hutchison would increase or
decrease the Group’s equity by $11 million (30 June 2014: $10 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the Group’s ability to meet its contractual obligations as they fall due. The Group evaluates its liquidity
requirements on an ongoing basis. In general, the Group generates sufficient cash flows from its operating activities to meet its
financial liabilities.
In the event of any shortfalls, the Group has two short-term financing programmes in place; a $500 million Note Facility and a
US$1 billion European Commercial Paper Programme.
In addition to the short-term financing programmes at 30 June 2015, the Group had the following:
• An undrawn committed standby facility of $200 million (30 June 2014: $300 million) with a number of creditworthy banks; and
• Committed bank overdraft facilities of $15 million with New Zealand banks (30 June 2014: $15 million).
There are no compensating balance requirements associated with these facilities.
The Group’s liquidity policy is to maintain unutilised committed facilities of at least 110% of the next 12 months’ forecast peak net
funding requirements. The policy also requires that the maximum amount of long-term debt maturing in any 12-month period is not
to exceed $400 million. As at 30 June 2015 management considered that it was in compliance with its liquidity policy, as reported to
the Board.

Notes to the financial statements
NOTE 20 Financial risk management (continued)

Credit risk
Credit risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business on cash, trade receivables, other receivables, finance lease receivables
and derivative financial instruments if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group has a credit policy that is
used to manage this exposure, which includes limits on exposures with significant counterparties that have been set and approved
by the Board and are monitored on a regular basis. The Group places its cash and derivative financial instruments with high credit
quality financial institutions and sovereign bodies. The Group’s financial instruments do not have significant concentration of risk
with any single party.
The Group has certain derivative and debt agreements that are subject to bilateral credit support agreements that require the Group
or the counterparty to post collateral funds to support the value of certain derivatives. As at 30 June 2015 no collateral was posted
(30 June 2014: nil). In the event of a downgrade of the Company’s credit rating to BBB+ (Standard & Poor’s) no collateral would be
required to be posted (30 June 2014: US$12 million).
Of the Group’s assets, $764 million are subject to credit risk (30 June 2014: $972 million). The Group holds various letters of credit
and guarantees over some of these amounts. The Group does not hold any collateral over these amounts.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital considering shareholders’ interests, the value of the Group’s assets and the Company’s credit ratings.
The following table summarises the Group’s capital:

The Board continues to be committed to the Company maintaining an ‘A Band’ credit rating and its capital management policies are
designed to ensure this objective is met. As part of this commitment, the Group manages its debt levels to ensure that the ratio of
net interest-bearing debt (inclusive of associated derivatives) to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation does not
materially exceed 1.1 times on a long-run basis, which for credit ratings agency purposes equates approximately to debt to earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 1.5 times. The difference between these two ratios is primarily due to the
capitalisation of operating leases by credit ratings agencies.
As at 30 June 2015 the Company’s Standard & Poor’s credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt is A- and A-2 respectively,
with outlook stable (30 June 2014: same).
Net debt includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash.
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.
The following table reconciles long-term debt at hedged rates to long-term debt at spot rates as reported under NZ IFRS:

Notes to the financial statements
NOTE 21 Leases (continued)

Finance leases with Chorus
On demerger, the Group entered into a number of leases with Chorus for space in exchange buildings. Under these leases the
Group is:
• a lessor for space in the Group’s exchanges; and
• a lessee for space in Chorus exchanges.
These leases are generally accounted for as finance leases and include a legal right of offset, as the Group and Chorus settle the
payments on a net basis. As such the finance lease payable and finance lease receivable are shown as a net finance lease receivable
on the statement of financial position. There are no contingent rents on the leases with Chorus. The profile of lease net receipts is set
out below:

The remaining term of the leases when the Group is the lessor is for seven years, with multiple rights of renewal for a further 24
years. The term of the leases when the Group is the lessee is less than one year, with rights of renewal for a further five years. The full
term has been used in the calculation of the finance leases payable and receivable, as it is likely that due to the specialised nature of
the buildings, the leases will be renewed to the maximum term.

Commitments principally relate to telecommunications network equipment, the Tasman Global Access cable and cable capacity.
As at 30 June 2014, $158 million related to 700 MHz radio spectrum.

Other commitments
As at 30 June 2015 the Group had other supplier commitments of $584 million (30 June 2014: $330 million) with $384 million due
in the year ending 30 June 2016 (30 June 2014: $316 million due in the year ended 30 June 2015). Operating lease commitments
are detailed in note 21.


NOTE 23 Contingencies

Effect of outstanding claims
The Group has ongoing claims, investigations and inquiries, none of which it currently believes are expected to have significant
effect on the financial position or profitability of the Group. However, the Group cannot reasonably estimate the adverse effect
(if any) on the Group if any of the foregoing outstanding claims or inquiries are ultimately resolved against the Group’s interests.
There can be no assurance that such cases will not have a significant effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, position,
results of operations or profitability.

Unbundled Copper Local Loop and Unbundled Bitstream Access price review
The Commerce Commission is currently undertaking Final Pricing Principle (FPP) reviews of the costs for the regulated Unbundled
Copper Local Loop (UCLL) and Unbundled Bitstream Access (UBA) services. On 2 July 2015 it released its latest draft determinations
for each service, with draft costs of $26.74 for UCLL and $11.15 for UBA. These compare with the Commission’s Initial Pricing
Principle costs for these services of $23.46 (for UCLL) and $10.92 (for UBA) and earlier draft FPP determinations of $28.22 for UCLL
and $10.17 for UBA released on 2 December 2014. The Commission has indicated it expects to issue final determinations for these
costs, following a consultation process, in December 2015. Its preliminary view is that the costs set in the final determination will take
effect from the date of the final determination. This differs from the Commission’s earlier view that these prices would take effect on
1 December 2014. The Group has provided for its commitment to pass the value of retail price increases related to the Commission’s
earlier view back to customers in a fair and transparent way if the decision on backdating is confirmed. Any increase in costs or their
effective date when the final determinations are announced may have a material impact on the Group.

1 The figures shown are gross amounts and exclude GST (where applicable). In addition to these amounts, Spark New Zealand meets costs incurred by directors that are incidental
  to the performance of their duties. This includes providing directors with telephone concessions and paying the costs of directors’ travel. As these costs are incurred by Spark
  New Zealand to enable directors to perform their duties, no value is attributable to them as benefits to directors for the purposes of the above table.

Diversity
Spark New Zealand believes that our success is intrinsically linked to our people and that in an increasingly global world, the diversity of
our people – the unique insights, perspectives and ideas that people from diverse backgrounds bring – will be critical to the future
performance of our business.
Our approach to diversity is based on strategy-first: the tangible actions we take to enhance the diversity of our workforce are designed
to align with, and support, our strategy. It is our aim to have a workforce that is reflective of the emerging make-up of New Zealand
– those that are our customers today and who will be our customers in the future.
Over the past year we have made targeted investments in programmes in support of these aims:
>> continued sponsorship of current and emerging senior women leaders on the Global Women Breakthrough Leadership Programme
   of which we are a major partner;
>> initiated internal forums to engage on diversity and inclusion, including external speakers and special interest groups;
>> actively engaged and supported industry groups, such as Women in Technology and Global Telco Forum;
>> sponsored emerging female talent onto targeted development programmes, such as the Global Women Activation series;
>> partnered with the First Foundation to sponsor scholarships and provide work experience for talented young New Zealanders who
   lack the financial means to a tertiary education;
>> sponsored leaders and high potential employees of Pasifika descent on the BEST Pasifika Leadership Programme; and
>> engaged in the ‘Champions for Change’ initiative.
