Working on Refreshed Strategic Plan

•   Solid results but market changes and learnings from last three years of
    execution require a strategic response

•   Customers strongly preferring wireless connectivity and digital self service

•   Growing portion of the market is buying primarily on price

•   If approved, merger of Vodafone and SkyTV will change the industry structure
    and competitive playing field; decision expected February 2017

•   New leadership team now working on next evolution of market strategy to
    respond to current trends and future risks; expanding the Skinny brand into
    broadband is our first significant move

•   Will share a refreshed strategic plan at an investor day before the end of this
    financial year
