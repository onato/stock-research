                                                           Covid-19 has accelerated new ways of

    $23 million, or 5.5%, was driven largely by strong growth in
    annuity revenues and service management revenues.
•   Voice revenues declined due to a combination of continued
    connection losses as voice becomes a smaller part of the
    business, lower voice usage of existing customers, and
    non-recurring refunds of $16 million for historic wire
    maintenance charges.
•   Other gains of $28 million, down $7 million from FY20, were
    mainly generated from the sale of mobile network
    equipment and gains on lease modifications as we
    renegotiated property leases.

•   Investing cash outflows were $23 million lower than the prior
    year due to fewer contributions to long-term investments.
•   Financing cash outflows decreased by $42 million as a result
    of lower payments for dividends due to uptake of the
    dividend reinvestment plan, partially offset by net
    repayments of debt, compared to net proceeds in the
    prior year.

Diversity and inclusion
We aspire for diversity and inclusion to be
“how things are done at Spark” – embedded
into our day-to-day activities, standards, and
business practices. We have maintained our
focus on gender and ethnic representation
as well as addressing our median pay gap
over the last year. In the year ahead we have
several new initiatives to drive further
improvements in representation and
reductions in the pay gap, while also
focussing on more opportunities to address
enhanced accessibility.

In FY21 Spark Foundation established two
new partnerships to support the growth of
Skinny Jump in the community.
At the start of the school year, a half-a-million-
dollar fund was launched in partnership with
Spark network supplier, Ciena, to provide
Jump free to eligible students in decile 1 and
2 high schools across New Zealand. The
‘Ciena Jump for Students Fund’ gives eligible
students a free Skinny Jump wireless modem
and broadband connection – including
150GB of free data per month, until the end
of the school year.
In June, Spark Foundation announced the
‘Awhi Matihiko: Red Cross Digital Settlement
Package’ – a collaboration with New Zealand
Red Cross, Internet NZ, and Digital Inclusion
Alliance Aotearoa to empower new refugees
with digital access. The package includes a
Skinny Jump connection with data paid for

Strategic role of the Board
Spark’s Board plays a critical role in helping to
guide and test company strategy, by
engaging in an ongoing conversation with
the Leadership Squad around key strategic
decisions. These decisions are in relation to
the long-term strategic planning and
direction of the business, including non-
financial performance and our ability to create
value in the medium and long term. This
includes customer experience, environmental,
social and governance measures.
As the body elected by shareholders to
protect and enhance the value of Spark’s
assets, the Board has oversight of Spark’s
financials and the annual and three-year
planning processes. Board members engage
in robust discussions with management
around the strategic direction of the business
to test and ensure investment is going
towards the things that will deliver the best
outcomes for the company and shareholders.
This flows through to Spark’s remuneration
policies where there is Board involvement in
setting targets and hurdles for short-term and
long-term incentives.

 Notes to the financial statements: Financial performance information

 Section 2 Financial performance information

 2.1 Segment information

 The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how Spark reviews its performance.
 Spark’s segments are measured based on product margin, which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs. The
 segment result excludes other gains, labour, operating expenses, depreciation and amortisation, net investment income, finance income
 and expense and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall Group level by the Chief Executive.

 Comparative segment results
 Spark has reclassified the comparative segment results to reflect changes in the classification of CCL solutions and cloud-based telephony
 products and also a reclassification of some voice revenues to managed data, networks and services. Therefore, managed data, network
 and services revenues have increased by $29 million due to a reclassification from cloud, security and services management of $23 million,
 voice of $5 million, and procurement and partners of $1 million. There is no change to the overall Spark reported result because of these
 changes.

2.2 Operating revenues and other gains

The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues are outlined below:

Contracts with customers
Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
1. Identify the contract with a customer;
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer;
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling prices;          2
   and
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price
and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over
time is recognised using the resources consumed by customers method or the time-elapsed method, as these best depict the transfer of
goods or services to customers.
Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service
management contracts. Contracts with significant payment terms include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-free
payment terms of greater than 12 months.
The nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)


     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the transaction price
     Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
     entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
     is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.
     We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within that
     product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value of            2
     money. The expected value or most likely amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount where
     it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction price. In
     making this determination consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as well as
     factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience with similar
     types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations, as well
     as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives,
     penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.

     Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
     Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
     performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative
     stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the
     observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar
     customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into account
     reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of customer. In
     determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum
     enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as
     revenue as they are earned.

     Distinct goods and services
     We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
     individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
     items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products
     and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.

     Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
     We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the
     methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Refer to page 69 for Spark’s
     accounting policy on timing of satisfaction of performance obligations.

 2.5 Non-GAAP measures

 Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
 Reporting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’). Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in
 the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate
 performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they
 should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not
 uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the telecommunications industry.
 Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
 expenses and impairments) individually greater than $25 million. There are no adjusting items for the years ended 30 June 2021 or
 30 June 2020.

 Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment
 income (EBITDAI)
 Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back depreciation and amortisation, finance expense and income tax expense and subtracting finance
 income and net investment income (which includes dividend income and Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates and joint
 ventures) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with,
 those presented in these financial statements.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease
receivables is estimated to be $213 million (30 June 2020: $163 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value because of the short term to maturity.

Contract assets
Contract assets primarily relate to Spark’s rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting date.
Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. The following summarises significant changes in
those balances:

 3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

 Contract costs
 Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract (such as commission costs) and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be
 recovered and are therefore initially deferred and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is consistent with
 the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises significant changes in those
 balances:

      Key estimates and assumptions
      Determining the costs we incur to obtain or fulfil a contract that meets the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires us to make
      significant judgements. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise
      the costs within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer
      tenure for consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.



 Expected credit loss allowance provision
 Movements in the loss allowance provision are as follows:

 1 The total expected loss provision reduced $14 million in FY21, of which $8 million reflected the release of additional provisions taken in FY20 primarily as a result of
   Covid-19.

3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
loss provision for trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and other receivables. The
calculation of the allowance provision incorporates forward-looking information, such as forecasted economic conditions.
The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:
                                                                                                   CURRENT      ≤ 1 MONTH     > 1 MONTH            TOTAL

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be
subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.


     Key estimates and assumptions
     The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
     rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
     impairment calculation based on Spark’s past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates
     at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
     unemployment rates and gross domestic product in New Zealand.

 3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

 Finance lease receivables
 Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in
 Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore
 shown as a net finance lease receivable on the statement of financial position.
 In addition, Spark sub-leases a number of office building floors. Where sub-leases are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable term
 of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.
 The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

 1 Included within the discounted balance for 30 June 2021 is a $1 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease receivable.

 The lease with Chorus, where Spark is the lessor, has multiple rights of renewals and the full lease term has been used in the calculation of
 the financial lease receivable at lease inception, as it was likely that because of the specialised nature of the buildings, the lease would be
 renewed to the maximum term.

Spark holds a 10% interest in Hutchison Telecommunications Australia Limited (Hutchison) which is quoted on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX) and its fair value is measured using the observable bid share price as quoted on the ASX, classified as being within Level 1

Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited (together
‘Southern Cross’) as their carrying values were reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross’ deficits or repay dividends.
For the year ended 30 June 2021 Spark’s share of Southern Cross profits was not recognised because of the existence of historic
cumulative Southern Cross deficits. In the current year Southern Cross’ profit was $39 million (30 June 2020: $51 million).

 Notes to the financial statements: Assets

 3.4 Right-of-use assets

 Spark is a lessee for a large number of leases, including:
 • Property – Spark leases a number of office buildings and retail stores. These leases generally have rights of renewal that are reasonably
   certain to be exercised and therefore may have long effective lease terms;
 • Capacity arrangements – Spark enters into a number of indefeasible right-of-use capacity arrangements for cable capacity;
 • Mobile sites – Spark has entered into a number of agreements to allow the operation of mobile network infrastructure throughout
   New Zealand;
 • Motor vehicles – Spark leases motor vehicles for use in sales, field operations and maintenance of infrastructure equipment; and
 • Other – Spark leases equipment that is held at Spark premises and used to provide services to customers.
 Movements in right-of-use assets are summarised below:

 1 Remeasurements to property primarily relate to modifications and changes of assumptions for leases, including market rent reviews and reductions in lease terms for
   corporate property leases. The reduction in property right-of-use assets is substantially offset by a reduction in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).

 All capacity additions for the year ended 30 June 2021 were fully paid on control being obtained and therefore deemed capital
 expenditure as reconciled in note 2.5 (30 June 2020: all fully paid and deemed capital expenditure).
 Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets for the year ended 30 June 2021 was $1 million (30 June 2020: $1 million).

3.4 Right-of-use assets (continued)


     Key estimates and assumptions
     At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the
     contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess
     whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
     • The contract involves the use of an identified asset;
     • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
     • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset.
     At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
     to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
     commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
     adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate
     of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any
     lease incentives received.
     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
     the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are               3
     determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for
     impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.



3.5 Leased customer equipment assets

Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of lease arrangements for customer premises equipment. Such
arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a genuine sale if control
of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that a sale does not occur as
control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor.
Spark as the seller-lessee continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset, which is initially measured at cost. The asset is
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term. Movements in leased customer equipment
assets are summarised below:

intangible assets in the joint operation was $30 million (30 June 2020: $31 million).


     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark’s property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets’
     estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires management
     judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
     obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark’s property, plant and equipment is as follows:
     Telecommunications equipment
     Links and cables                                  10 – 50 years
     Network transport                                 3 – 15 years
     Mobile radio access network                       5 – 18 years                                                                          3
     Customer premises equipment                       3 – 5 years
     International cable and satellite                 10 – 15 years
     Buildings
     Buildings                                         15 – 53 years
     Furniture and fittings                            3 – 15 years
     Air conditioning                                  8 – 20 years
     Power systems                                     3 – 25 years
     Batteries                                         5 – 15 years
     Other
     Motor vehicles                                    3 – 10 years
     Computer equipment                                2 – 8 years
     Internal IT system assets                         3 – 15 years

     The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
     conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
     flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
     include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
     for valuing future cash flows.

      Key estimates and assumptions
      Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment annually.
      Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement, including assessing the expected
      period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it.
      The estimated useful lives of Spark intangible assets is as follows:
      Spectrum licences                                                   2 – 21 years
      Software                                                            2 – 12 years
      Customer contracts and brands                                       5 – 10 years
      Other intangible assets                                             2 – 100 years

During the years ended 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of the carrying value of
goodwill. Headroom currently exists in each CGU and, based on sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.

                                                                                                                                                        3
     Key estimates and assumptions
     Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment using a value-in-use model, which estimates the future cash flows, based on the
     FY22 Board-approved business plan, applied to the next three years, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital
     expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU
     performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include
     revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future
     technology paths.
     Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2021
     (30 June 2020: 8.8%).

1 Remeasurements to property primarily relate to modifications and changes of assumptions for leases, including market rent reviews and reductions in lease terms for
  corporate property leases. The reduction in lease liabilities is substantially offset by a reduction in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4).
2 Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark’s
  option.

 4.2 Lease liabilities (continued)


      Key estimates and assumptions
      Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
      the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
      rate cannot be readily determined, Spark’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as
      the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
      Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
      • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
      • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement
        date;
      • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee;
      • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise; and
      • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.
      The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
      future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark’s estimate of the amount expected to
      be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or
      extension option.
      When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
      asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
      Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12
      months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within operating
      expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

4.3 Debt

Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and measured
at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes attributable to
the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in the statement of

 Notes to the financial statements: Liabilities and equity

 4.3 Debt (continued)

 None of Spark’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark’s debt,
 however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default
 over Spark’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020.
 The fair value of long-term debt, including long-term debt due within one year, based on market observable prices, was $1,270 million
 compared to a carrying value of $1,245 million as at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: fair value of $1,254 million compared to a carrying value
 of $1,244 million).

 4.4 Capital risk management

 Spark manages its capital considering shareholders’ interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board
 continues to be committed to the Company maintaining a single ‘A Band’ credit rating and its capital management policies are designed
 to ensure this objective is met. As part of this commitment Spark manages its debt levels to ensure that the ratio of net debt at hedged
 rates (being inclusive of associated derivatives) to EBITDAI does not materially exceed 1.4 times on a long-run basis, which, for credit rating
 agency purposes, Spark estimates equates approximately to adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.7 times. The difference between these two
 ratios is primarily due to the credit rating agency making adjustments for leases and captive finance operations.
 As at 30 June 2021 the Company’s Standard & Poor’s credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt were A- and A-2 respectively,
 with outlook stable (30 June 2020: same).

 Net debt
 Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to
 arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge
 adjustments and any unamortised discount.
 Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management. A
 reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt at carrying value is provided below:

 1 Net debt at hedged rates is the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity and includes an adjustment to state the principal of foreign currency medium term
   notes at the hedged currency rate.
 2 Fair value hedge adjustments arise on domestic notes in fair value hedges and foreign currency medium term notes in dual fair value and cash flow hedges. These have
   no impact on the cash flows to arise on maturity.

      Dividend Reinvestment Plan
      The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders can elect to receive dividends in additional shares.

than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020 no
derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting
of any derivative financial instruments is $20 million (30 June 2020: $39 million).

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
Derivatives are designated:
• Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt;
• Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions; and
• Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in
  cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective
cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the                    5
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate debt
and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency fixed-rate debt into variable rate debt.
Electricity hedge contracts are designated in cash flow hedges to reduce electricity price risk from price fluctuations. These hedge
contracts establish the price at which future specified quantities of electricity are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be
paid or received is recognised as a component of electricity costs through the term of the contracts.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

  Other amounts deferred in equity will be transferred to the statement of profit or loss over the next four years (30 June 2020: five years).
  Included within the closing balance at 30 June 2021 is $3 million relating to the cost of hedging reserve (30 June 2020: $2 million). The
  movement in the hedge reserves includes $68 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $19 million associated deferred
  tax, $6 million in relation to electricity derivatives and $2 million for forward foreign exchange contracts (30 June 2020: $49 million in the
  change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $14 million associated deferred tax).
  Fair value hedges
  Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
  the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
  year ended 30 June 2021 there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2020: no material
  ineffectiveness).
  Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
  Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian Krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark’s risk management policy, cross-
  currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
  convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
  CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are
  excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
  For fair value hedges the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
  and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
  Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
  of the debt.
  The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRS is recognised in other
  comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to profit
  or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AUD$461 million at 30
June 2021 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2020: AUD$461 million). These losses and temporary
differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the
production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority
requirements.
Spark has a negative $18 million imputation credit account balance as at 30 June 2021 due to the timing of dividend and tax payments
(30 June 2020: nil). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.

6.2 Employee share schemes

Spark operates share-based compensation plans that are equity settled as outlined below.

Restricted share schemes (RSS)
A restricted share scheme was initially introduced for selected employees in September 2001. For new allocations after August 2015 these
were replaced by two new restricted share schemes:
• Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme; and
• Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long-Term Incentive Scheme.                                                                                   6
The Spark New Zealand Long-Term Incentive Scheme is for the Leadership Squad and senior leaders and delivers one scheme with the
same set of rules under one long-term incentive, with a performance hurdle in place. The Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long-
Term Incentive Scheme related to the previous Managing Director, Simon Moutter.
Under these restricted share schemes ordinary shares in the Company are issued to Spark Trustee Limited. Participants purchase shares
from Spark Trustee Limited with funds lent to them by the Company and which are held on their behalf by Spark Trustee Limited. If the
individual is still employed by Spark at the end of the vesting period (generally three years) and applicable performance hurdles are met,
the employee is provided a cash bonus, which must be used to repay the loan and the shares are then transferred to the individual. The
target for this hurdle is the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. The last year when RSS shares were granted was
FY19 therefore FY22 will be the last year where RSS shares vest.

 6.2 Employee share schemes (continued)

 Share option scheme
 From September 2019 members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders have been granted options
 under the new Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme. Under the scheme participants are granted options at the start of the three-year
 vesting period. The number of options granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark New
 Zealand shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment, at
 vesting each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark
 employment) then the options simply lapse, with exceptions for redundancy, death and disablement. Spark enables participants to meet
 tax obligations through PAYE by authorising the sale of a sufficient number of shares on their behalf.
 Vesting of the LTI grants are contingent on: participants’ continued employment with Spark for three years from grant date (subject to
 exceptions); and the Company achieving a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance hurdle. TSR is a measure of share price
 appreciation and dividends paid over the three-year period of the grant. The target for this hurdle is set annually and for grants issued in
 2019 and 2020 this was the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually. Options with an intrinsic value of $9 million (30 June
 2020: $5 million) remain outstanding at 30 June 2021 and have a weighted average remaining life of 1.7 years (30 June 2020: 2.2 years).
 Information regarding shares and options awarded under these schemes is as follows:

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited
Opinion                                We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries (the
                                       ‘Group’), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2021, and the
                                       consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity
                                       and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
                                       including a summary of significant accounting policies.
                                       In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 62 to 104, present fairly, in all
                                       material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2021, and its consolidated
                                       financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to
                                       International Financial Reporting Standards (‘NZ IFRS’) and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’).


Basis for opinion                      We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (‘ISAs’) and International
                                       Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). Our responsibilities under those standards are further
                                       described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our
                                       report.
                                       We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
                                       opinion.
                                       We are independent of the Company in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International
                                       Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand)

                                       Independence Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
                                       requirements.
                                       Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to regulatory audit, other

                                       advisory services and non-assurance services provided to the Corporate Taxpayers Group. These services have
                                       not impaired our independence as auditor of the Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a
                                       sister and brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the provision
                                       of any services to the Group and its subsidiaries and this matter has not impacted our independence. Also,
                                       partners and employees of our firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading
                                       activities of the business of the Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in the Group.


Audit materiality                      We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements of the
                                       Group that in our judgment would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
                                       knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the ‘quantitative’ materiality). In addition, we also
                                       assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgment change or
                                       influence the decisions of such a person (the ‘qualitative’ materiality). We use materiality both in planning the
                                       scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
                                       We determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be $26 million.


Key audit matters                      Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of
                                       the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
                                       our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
                                       not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

 consolidated financial                includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
 statements                            conducted in accordance with ISAs and ISAs (NZ) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
                                       Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
                                       they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these

2. This table excludes contributions towards medical and life insurance of a total of $9,898. Spark meets costs incurred by directors that are incidental to the performance of their duties.
   This includes providing New Zealand-based directors with mobile phones and $120 per month home phone account credits and overseas-based directors with $400 per month
   phone allowances. Spark also meets the costs of directors’ Spark-related travel. As these costs are incurred by Spark to enable directors to perform their duties, no value is attributable
   to them as benefits to directors for the purposes of the above table.

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary but ideally would increase
this shareholding to 100% of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any long-term incentive schemes. To fulfil this expectation shares
are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019. As at 30 June 2021 the CEO holds 142,214 ordinary shares which fulfils this
expectation to hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary, which based on the share price as at 30 June
2021 equates to approximately 57% of the CEO’s base salary as at 30 June 2021.

Mr Richard Quince received a directors fee of NZ$10,000 (excluding GST) for acting as a director of Teleco Insurance (NZ) Limited. Ocorian
Services (Bermuda) Limited received directors fees of US$2,900 in relation to Ms Carol Feathers acting as a director of Teleco Insurance Limited.

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or, in
the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive
director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as at
the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased within a
three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, within a three-year period from that
date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the aggregate sale price for all
shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) content index
To prioritise Spark’s reporting on sustainability topics we have followed GRI’s materiality principle (set out in GRI 101) to identify and prioritise
topics which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social, or economic
impact.
Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of stakeholder feedback, review of industry peers and interviews with external stakeholders.
Internally we consult with a range of employees, including members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk, legal and HR
teams, to determine Spark’s view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria.
In FY21 we have reviewed and updated our list of material impacts, taking into account new and emerging issues particularly related to the
recovery after Covid-19. This has prioritised our role to support economic recovery and highlighted the importance of investment in resilient
and adaptable infrastructure. We have also followed the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR> Framework,
considering whether a matter could substantively affect Spark’s ability to create value in the short, medium or long term.

The ‘Kora Aotearoa’ logo on the front cover of
our report sits alongside the ‘Spark
New Zealand’ logo, symbolising our
partnership with Māori and our commitment
to Te Korowai Tupu (our Māori Strategy).
The literal translation of Spark New Zealand is
Kora Aotearoa as ‘Spark’ in te reo Māori is
‘Kora’ and ‘Aotearoa’ is the Māori name for
‘New Zealand’.
Ngā Hau e Whā - The four koru forms
represent ‘Ngā Hau e Whā’ or ‘coming from
the four winds’ and this symbol has been used
to signify our embracing all nationalities as
part of our Spark whanau.
External star - The external star draws a
connection with the Spark logo and
represents the revealed world that we know.
Internal star - The star at the centre of the logo
symbolises enlightenment – it is our central
point of understanding.
As a whole the Kora Aotearoa logo expresses
the revealed world of enlightenment. The
‘DAWN OF LIGHT’. By location Aotearoa is the
first to see the light of dawn. Echoing the
‘DAWN OF LIGHT’ approach.
