Spark holds a 10% interest in Hutchison Telecommunications Australia Limited (Hutchison) which is
quoted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and measures its fair value using its observable
market share price as quoted on the ASX, classified as being within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
As at 31 December 2019 the quoted price of Hutchison’s shares on the ASX was A$0.120 (30 June
2019: A$0.110). The change in fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Subsequent to balance date, on 13 February 2020, the Federal Court of Australia ruled to allow the
proposed merger between Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited and TPG Telecom Limited. The
quoted price of Spark’s investment in Hutchison (a shareholder of Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty
Limited) increased materially following this announcement and on 17 February 2020 was A$0.152.
The fair value of Spark’s investment in Hutchison based on this price would be $215 million, an
increase of $46 million from 31 December 2019.

Investment in associates and joint ventures
Spark’s investment in associates and joint ventures at 31 December 2019 consists of the following:

NOTE 6 Debt (continued)


Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt
at the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash.
Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge adjustments and any
unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS
but is a measure used by management. A reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt
at carrying value is provided below:

          financial statements
          Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements based on our
          review. We conducted our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410. NZ SRE 2410 requires us to conclude
          whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim consolidated financial
          statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
          The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in
          accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Accordingly we do not express an audit
          opinion on these interim consolidated financial statements.
          This description forms part of our Independent Review Report.
