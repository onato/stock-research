    • Following the announcement in August 2017 of the intention
      for Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited and TPG Telecom
      Limited to merge, the quoted price of Spark’s investment in
      Hutchison Telecommunications Australia Limited (a shareholder
      of Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited) increased
      materially. In May 2019 the Australian Competition and
      Consumer Commission announced it opposed the merger and
      court proceedings were subsequently lodged by Vodafone
      Hutchison Australia to challenge this decision. As at 30 June
      2019, the fair value of Spark’s investment was $156 million and
      the increase of $87 million during the year has been recognised
      within other comprehensive income.
    • Spark’s net earnings for the year includes $1 million from our
      share of the net losses of associates and joint ventures.

    Notes to the financial statements: General information


    1.4 Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 15 and NZ IFRS 16 (continued)

    Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 15
    The impact of the adoption of NZ IFRS 15 on the statement of profit or loss primarily relates to:
    • The impact of revised guidance in the new standard in relation to the existence of a significant financing component in a contract. The
      inherent financing component of Spark’s interest-free device offers to customers was previously assessed using Spark’s incremental
      borrowing rate, however, NZ IFRS 15 requires the use of an interest rate that would be used in a separate financing transaction
      between Spark and the customer that reflects their credit characteristics. The application of this rate to the sale of devices sold on
      repayment plans has resulted in a reduction in device revenue and an increase in interest income recognised over the repayment term.
    • The impact of revised guidance in the new standard for determining whether an entity is a principal or agent when delivering goods or
      services to customers. Spark has assessed that we are an agent in relation to third-party services, such as Spotify and Netflix, and also
      certain cloud, security and service management contracts, which may incorporate services provided by third parties. This has resulted
      in a reduction in reported operating revenue and operating expenses but no impact on net earnings.

    Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 16
    The adoption of NZ IFRS 16 has had a significant impact on the statement of profit or loss of Spark. The fully retrospective application of
    NZ IFRS 16 results in the combined depreciation and interest expense for any lease in the early years of its term being higher than the
    operating expense previously recognised. Spark’s long-term corporate property leases (which account for a significant portion of the
    adjustments under NZ IFRS 16) are generally in the early years of their lease terms and both net earnings before tax and retained
    earnings therefore decrease following adoption of NZ IFRS 16. The difference over the lives of the leases will be nil and there is no impact
    on cash flows.

    Long-term investments change in disclosure
    Spark's long-term investments, as detailed in note 3.3, includes holdings in associate and joint venture companies which are equity
    accounted and other investments including shares in Hutchison which are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
    Net investment income from long-term investments comprises dividend income (primarily from Southern Cross) and Spark's share of
    associate and joint venture net profits or losses.
    The disclosure of Spark’s net investment income from long-term investments has changed from being reported within earnings before
    finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to now being recognised in a new ‘net investment
    income’ category, reported outside of earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net
    investment income (EBITDAI). This is to better align Spark’s disclosure of operating revenue with revenue from contracts with customers,
    as defined by NZ IFRS 15, and to apply more appropriate focus on the financial performance of the operational activities of the business.




                                                                                                                                       48

Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 15
The adoption of NZ IFRS 15 has no impact on Spark’s net cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities or the overall net
cash flows for the current or restated periods.
The application of an interest rate that would be used in a separate financing transaction between Spark and the customer that reflects
their credit characteristics for our ‘interest-free’ device offer has resulted in a reclassification between cash received from customers and
interest receipts.

Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 16
The adoption of NZ IFRS 16 has had no net impact on Spark’s statement of cash flows, however it has resulted in the reclassification of
cash flows from lease arrangements. Payments for operating leases under NZ IAS 17 were included within ‘payments to suppliers and
employees’ in operating cash flows. Payments for leases are now split between payments for interest, included in operating cash flows,
and payments that reduce the principal balance of a lease liability, included in financing cash flows.

Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 15
The primary changes from adoption of NZ IFRS 15 to Spark’s balance sheet are as a result of new guidance for the treatment of contract
costs, including costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract.
Prior to adoption of NZ IFRS 15, Spark deferred and recognised certain external commission costs over their contract term within
operating expense. Such costs generally continue to meet the costs to obtain a contract criterion under NZ IFRS 15, however, we have
identified further commission costs that are required to be deferred under the new standard.

Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 16
The adoption of NZ IFRS 16 has had a significant impact on the statement of financial position of Spark. For the opening restated balance
sheet as at 1 July 2017, this includes an increase in total assets by $384 million and total liabilities by $440 million, with a $56 million
reduction in retained earnings. The decrease in retained earnings is as a result of the acceleration of lease interest expense in the early
years of leases.
There has also been a change in the treatment of equipment leases where Spark acts as the intermediate party (i.e. back-to-back leases)
and which also includes an initial sale and leaseback transaction. In combination with new guidance provided by NZ IFRS 15, Spark has
assessed that generally the initial sale of the equipment does not result in control being passed to the customer. As a result the
equipment is not derecognised following the initial sale and remains as leased customer equipment assets on the statement of financial
position. The leaseback is accounted as a financial liability in accordance with NZ IFRS 9 and the sub-lease as either an outwards
operating lease or finance lease, depending on its terms.
On adoption of NZ IFRS 16, Spark has also reclassified assets associated with capacity arrangements that were previously recognised
within intangible assets to right-of-use assets. For the opening balance sheet as at 1 July 2017, this resulted in a net book value
reclassification of $255 million. Capacity arrangements are generally in the form of an indefeasible right-of-use asset and meet the
definition of a lease under NZ IFRS 16. Payments for such arrangements are usually made in whole up front and there is therefore
generally no associated lease liability.

    2.1 Segment information
    The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Managing Director and are how Spark reviews its performance.
    Spark’s segments changed following the change in organisational operating model in conjunction with the adoption of agile ways of
    working, which eliminated the previous business unit structure. Spark’s segment results are now measured based on product margin,
    which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs. The segment result excludes other gains, labour, operating
    expenses, depreciation and amortisation, net investment income, finance income and expense and income tax expense, as these are
    assessed at an overall Spark Group level by the Managing Director.

    Comparative segment results
    Spark has restated the comparative segment results in line with the change in organisational operating model and the adoption of NZ
    IFRS 15 and NZ IFRS 16.

2.2 Operating revenues and other gains
The accounting policies specific to Spark’s operating revenues, which have changed in the current year as a result of the adoption of NZ
IFRS 15, are outlined below:

Contracts with customers
Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:
1. Identify the contract with a customer;
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer;
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling             2
   prices; and
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband
service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or
service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price
and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.
Where contracts require the customer to commit to a minimum level of service or a minimum monthly payment amount that cannot be
decreased without terminating the contract, revenue is allocated to performance obligations using the minimum enforceable rights and
obligations and any excess amount is recognised as revenue as it is earned.
Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services,
control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. These services are typically provided, and thus
recognised, on a monthly basis. Control of products is typically transferred when the customer has physical possession of the goods. The
nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

 PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS                                                TIMING OF SATISFACTION
 FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS                                          OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND PAYMENT
 Mobile services, broadband services, media services, cloud,            As the service is provided (usually monthly). Generally billed and
 security and service management services, managed data                 paid on a monthly basis.
 services and rental of equipment
 Usage, other optional or non-subscription services, and pay-per-       As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid on a monthly
 use services                                                           basis.
 Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods                 When control is passed to the customer, generally when the
                                                                        customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in
                                                                        packages or on interest-free terms, customers usually pay in equal
                                                                        instalments over 6 to 36 months.
 Installation or set-up services (where distinct)                       As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid following the
                                                                        provision of the service.

Performance obligations where Spark acts as an agent include some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service
management contracts. Contracts with significant payment terms include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-free
payment terms of greater than 12 months.

     Key estimates and assumptions
     Determining the transaction price
     Determining the transaction price of Spark’s contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be
     entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that
     is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer.
     We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within
     that product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value
     of money. The expected value or most likely amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount
                                                                                                                                                 2
     where it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction
     price. In making this determination, consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as
     well as factors outside of Spark’s influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark’s experience
     with similar types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money
     calculations, as well as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price
     concessions, incentives, penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.

     Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price
     Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between
     performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the
     relative stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling
     price is the observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances
     and to similar customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price
     taking into account reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of
     customer. In determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on
     expected minimum enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are
     recognised as revenue as they are earned.

     Distinct goods and services
     We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for
     individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other
     items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate
     products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.

     Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
     We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time as well as the
     methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Revenue for performance
     obligations satisfied over time is recognised using the resources consumed by customers method or the time-elapsed method,
     as these best depict the transfer of goods or services to customers. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in
     time is recognised when control of the good or service is transferred to the customer, which is typically when the customer takes
     possession of the good.

2.5 Non-GAAP measures
Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS). Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in
the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate
performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they
should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not
uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the telecommunications industry.
Spark’s policy is to present ‘adjusted EBITDAI’ and ‘adjusted net earnings’ when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains,
expenses and impairments) greater than $25 million. There are no adjusting items for the year ended 30 June 2019. In the year ended 30
June 2018 costs of change of $49 million associated with the Quantum programme were deemed an adjusting item.

    2.5 Non-GAAP measures (continued)

    Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment income (EBITDAI) and
    adjusted EBITDAI
    Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back depreciation and amortisation, finance expense and income tax expense and subtracting
    finance income and net investment income (which includes dividend income and Spark’s share of net profits or losses from associates
    and joint ventures) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark’s EBITDAI and adjusted EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts
    taken from, and consistent with, those presented in these financial statements.

Amounts are stated at their carrying value, net of expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease receivables is
estimated to be $255 million (30 June 2018 Restated: $223 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at
amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value because of the short term to maturity.

Contract assets
Contract assets primarily relate to Spark’s rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting
date. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. The following summarises significant changes
in those balances:

    Contract costs
    Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract (such as commission costs) and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to
    be recovered and are therefore initially deferred and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is consistent
    with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises significant changes in
    those balances:

         Key estimates and assumptions
         Determining whether costs we incur to obtain or fulfil a contract meet the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires us to make
         significant judgments. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise
         the costs within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer
         tenure for consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.



    Expected credit loss allowance provision
    Movements in the loss allowance provision are as follows:

    Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected
    loss provision for trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and other receivables. The
    calculation of the allowance provision incorporates forward-looking information, such as forecasted economic conditions.

     Key estimates and assumptions
     The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss
     rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
     impairment calculation based on Spark’s past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates
     at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates,
     unemployment rates and gross domestic product in New Zealand.

    3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

    Finance lease receivables
    Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space
    in Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are
    therefore shown as a net finance lease receivable on the statement of financial position.
    In addition, Spark sub-leases a number of office building floors. Where sub-leases are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable
    term of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.
    The profile of finance lease net receipts is set out below:

    The leases with Chorus have multiple rights of renewal and the full lease terms have been used in the calculation of the net financial lease
    receivable, as it is likely that due to the specialised nature of the buildings, the leases will be renewed to the maximum terms.

    • Mobile sites – Spark has entered into a number of agreements to allow the operation of mobile network infrastructure throughout
      New Zealand; and

3.4 Right-of-use assets (continued)


     Key estimates and assumptions
     At inception of a contract, Spark uses judgement in assessing whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
     contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
     consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:
     • The contract involves the use of an identified asset;
     • Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use;
       and
     • Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset.
     At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract
     to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease
     commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
     adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
     estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is
     located, less any lease incentives received.
     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier
     of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets
                                                                                                                                                      3
     are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically
     assessed for impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.




3.5 Leased customer equipment assets
Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of back-to-back lease arrangements for customer premises
equipment. Such arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a
genuine sale if control of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark’s back-to-back lease arrangements, we have assessed that a
sale does not occur as control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor.
Spark as the seller-lessee continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset, which is initially measured at cost. The asset is
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term. Movements in leased customer equipment
assets are summarised below:

Joint arrangement
Spark has entered into a joint arrangement in relation to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic
submarine cable between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2019 the carrying value of Spark’s share of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in the joint operation was $33 million (30 June 2018: $36 million).


     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark’s property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets’
     estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires management
     judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset
     obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.
     The estimated useful lives of Spark’s property, plant and equipment is as follows:
     Telecommunications equipment and plant
        Junctions and trunk transmission systems                  10 – 50 years
        Switching equipment                                        5 – 12 years
        Customer premises equipment
        Other network equipment
                                                                   3 – 5 years
                                                                   2 – 25 years
                                                                                                                                            3
        Buildings                                                  9 – 50 years
     Other assets
        Motor vehicles	  6 years
        Furniture and fittings	  2 – 25 years
        Computer equipment	  3 – 5 years
     The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
     conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash
     flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements
     include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate
     for valuing future cash flows.

         Key estimates and assumptions
         Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment
         annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires management judgement, including its
         expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark
         ceasing to use it.
         The estimated useful lives of Spark intangible assets is as follows:
         Software	  2 – 8 years
         Spectrum licences                                             17 – 20 years
         Other intangible assets
            Customer contracts and brands	  5 – 10 years
            Other intangible assets	  5 – 80 years

During the years ended 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of goodwill. Headroom
currently exists in each CGU and, based on sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would
cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Spark changed its cash-generating units from 1 July 2018 following the change in organisational operating model in conjunction with the
adoption of agile ways of working, which eliminated the previous business unit structure. The revised cash-generating units are consistent
                                                                                                                                                  3
with the changes to Spark’s segment reporting as outlined in note 2.1.


     Key estimates and assumptions
     Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment by estimating the future cash flows based on Board-approved business plans, with
     key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on
     both past experience and future expectations of CGU performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an
     impairment assessment that require judgement include revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and
     customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future technology paths.
     Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1% was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2019
     (30 June 2018: 10.1%).

1 Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark’s option.




     Key estimates and assumptions
     Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of
     the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
     that rate cannot be readily determined, Spark’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate
     as the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.
     Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
     • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
     • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate initially measured using the index or rate as at the
       commencement date;
     • Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee;
     • The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise; and
     • Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.
     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
     future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark’s estimate of the amount expected
     to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or
     extension option.
     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-
     use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
     Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12
     months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within
     operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

    4.3 Debt
    Debt is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and
    measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes
    attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in
    the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

    None of Spark’s debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark’s debt,
    however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of
    default over Spark’s debt in the years ended 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018.
    The fair value of long-term debt, including amounts due within one year, (calculated based on the present value of future principal and
    interest cash flows, discounted at market interest rates at balance date) was $1,258 million compared to a carrying value of $1,245 million
    as at 30 June 2019 (30 June 2018: fair value of $1,072 million compared to a carrying value of $1,048 million).

4.4 Capital risk management
Spark manages its capital considering shareholders’ interests, the value of Spark’s assets and the Company’s credit rating. The Board
continues to be committed to the Company maintaining a single ‘A Band’ credit rating and its capital management policies are designed
to ensure this objective is met. As part of this commitment Spark manages its debt levels to ensure that the ratio of net debt at hedged
rates (being inclusive of associated derivatives) to EBITDAI does not materially exceed 1.4 times on a long-run basis, which, for credit
ratings agency purposes, Spark estimates equates approximately to adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.5 times. The difference between these
two ratios is primarily due to the credit rating agency making adjustments for leases and captive finance operations.
As at 30 June 2019 the Company’s Standard & Poor’s credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was A- and A-2 respectively, with
outlook stable (30 June 2018: same).

Net debt
Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due
to arise on maturity, plus short-term debt, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge
adjustments and any unamortised discount.
Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management.

    Spark’s derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and
    foreign exchange and electricity prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being
    inputs other than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2019 and 30 June
    2018 no derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for
    offsetting of any derivative financial instruments is immaterial.

    Hedge accounting
    Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and
    the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised.
    Derivatives are designated:
    • Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt;
    • Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions; and
    • Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in
      cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
    At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge
    instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an
    economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective
    cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether
    the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows
    of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
    Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of
    ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the
    change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign
exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as
interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate
debt and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency fixed rate debt into variable rate debt.
Electricity hedge contracts are designated in cash flow hedges to reduce electricity price risk from price fluctuations. These hedge
contracts establish the price at which future specified quantities of electricity are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be
paid or received is recognised as a component of electricity costs through the term of the contracts.
Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within
12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.
A reconciliation of movements in the cash flow hedge reserve, net of tax, is outlined below:

Other amounts deferred in equity will be transferred to the statement of profit or loss over the next six years (30 June 2018: seven years).
As at 30 June 2019 the cost of hedging reserve was $1 million (30 June 2018: nil).
Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring
the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the
year ended 30 June 2019 there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2018: No material
ineffectiveness).


                                                                                                                                                     5
Dual fair value and cash flow hedges
Spark has Australian dollar (AUD) and Norwegian Krone (NOK) denominated debt. As part of Spark’s risk management policy, cross-
currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and
convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the
CCIRS were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRS are
excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRS and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to
Spark’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term
of the debt.
The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRS is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to
profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

Concentration of credit risk for trade and other receivables is
limited due to Spark’s large customer base.
Spark has certain derivative and debt agreements that are subject
to bilateral credit support agreements that require Spark or the
counterparty to post collateral funds to support the value of certain
derivatives. As at 30 June 2019 no collateral was posted (30 June
2018: nil). Letters of credit and guarantees may also be held over
some receivable amounts. The carrying amounts of financial assets
represent the maximum credit exposure.

    Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AUD$461 million at
    30 June 2019 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2018: AUD$461 million). These losses and temporary
    differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the
    production of taxable profits over a significant period and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority requirements.
    Spark has a negative imputation credit account balance of $21 million as at 30 June 2019 due to the timing of dividend and tax
    payments (30 June 2018: $45 million negative balance). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2019 and
    31 March 2018.

6.2 Employee share schemes
Spark operates share-based compensation plans that are equity settled as outlined below.

Restricted share schemes
A restricted share scheme was initially introduced for selected employees in September 2001. For new allocations after August 2015
these were replaced by two new restricted share schemes:
• Spark New Zealand Long Term Incentive Scheme; and
• Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long Term Incentive Scheme.
The Spark New Zealand Long Term Incentive Scheme is for the Leadership Squad and senior leaders and delivers one scheme with the
same set of rules under one long-term incentive, with a performance hurdle in place. The Spark New Zealand Managing Director Long
Term Incentive Scheme replaced the Managing Director performance rights scheme.
Under these restricted share schemes ordinary shares in the Company are issued to Spark Trustee Limited. Participants purchase shares
from Spark Trustee Limited with funds lent to them by the Company and which are held on their behalf by Spark Trustee Limited. If the
individual is still employed by Spark at the end of the vesting period (generally three years) and applicable performance hurdles are met,
the employee is provided a cash bonus, which must be used to repay the loan and the shares are then transferred to the individual. The
target for this hurdle is the Company’s cost of equity plus 1% compounding annually.
Information regarding shares and options awarded under these schemes is as follows:
                                                                                                                      NUMBER OF SHARES

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments is recognised as an expense, with a
corresponding entry in equity. The total charge recognised for these schemes for the year ended 30 June 2019 was $2 million (30 June
2018: $2 million). As at 30 June 2019, $3 million of share scheme awards remain unvested and not expensed (30 June 2018: $3 million).
This expense, measured at its fair value based on a valuation model, will be recognised over the remaining vesting period of the awards.
Spark Share, an employee share purchase programme, does not have a material impact on these financial statements.

                                             Basis for opinion
                             We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). We
                             believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
                             We are independent of the group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised) Code of Ethics
                             for Assurance Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the
                             International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code),
                             and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.
                             Our responsibilities under ISAs (NZ) are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
                             consolidated financial statements section of our report.
                             Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to regulatory audit, other assurance-related
                             services (such as trustee reporting) and compliance services. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and
                             employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities
                             of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as auditor of the group. The firm
                             has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.




                                             Materiality
                             The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Materiality helped us to determine the
                             nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
                             and on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The materiality for the consolidated financial statements
                             as a whole was set at $26 million determined with reference to a benchmark of group earnings before income
                             tax. We chose the benchmark because, in our view, this is a key measure of the group’s performance.

               Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
               the consolidated financial statements in the current period. We summarise below those matters and our key audit
               procedures to address those matters in order that the shareholders as a body may better understand the process
               by which we arrived at our audit opinion. Our procedures were undertaken in the context of and solely for the
               purpose of our statutory audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole and we do not express

                                   Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial
                                   statements
                    The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for:
                    — the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
                          accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
                          Reporting Standards) and International Financial Reporting Standards;
                    — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a consolidated set of financial statements
                          that is fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
                    — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
                          going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
                          cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.



                                   Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
                                   statements
                    Our objective is:
                    — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
                          material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
                    — to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
                    Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
                    with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
                    Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
                    could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
                    consolidated financial statements.
                    A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of these consolidated financial statements is located at

2 FY20 anticipated target STI Scheme will be earned in FY20 and paid in FY21.

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to 25% of the CEO’s base salary but ideally would
increase this shareholding to 100% of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any Long-Term Incentive schemes. To fulfil this
expectation shares are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019.

Ratio of female to male pay
Spark reports on pay ratio by comparing female and male in like-for-like roles. These can be broken down into four distinct categories:
1. Leadership;
2. People assessed on Contribution Models, as described on page 21 of this annual report;
3. Customer Channels: People primarily assessed on the Accreditation Model, as described on page 21 of this annual report, employed
   within our Contact Centres and Retail Operations; and
4. Subsidiaries and other.

The following table sets out the ratio of female to male pay as at 30 June 2019.

1 Pay Ratio = (Average female salary – average male salary) divided by average male salary.


Sparks overall pay ratio of average female to average male pay for all 5,377 employees is -18%. A major contributor to this differential is the
make-up of New Zealand’s technology sector having a significantly higher proportion of males compared to females. Spark has sought to
reduce this ratio over time with initiatives such as Women in Technology scholarships and partnering with external technology educators,
designed to proactively build a New Zealand-wide pipeline of female technology qualified employees.

Parental Leave
Spark provides a parental leave policy for eligible employees, regardless of gender, sexuality, age or whether the employee is giving birth or
adopting a child. If an employee has been employed by Spark for a minimum of 12 months then Spark will top up the Government’s
parental leave payments so the employee receives 80% of their salary for up to 22 weeks. As a guaranteed minimum to the policy Spark
ensures that the total amount someone receives, less any Government paid primary carer’s payments, will not be less than the equivalent of
six weeks of ordinary salary.
Eligibility for parental leave is in accordance with Government legislation.

                                                                                                                                                    FEMALE                 MALE1

1 Each percentage stated has been rounded to the nearest 1/1,000th of a percent.
2 Includes 1,827,395 ordinary shares, 191,016 redeemable ordinary shares, 518,539 restricted ordinary shares and 4,169 ordinary shares held in custody for the M J Taylor Family Trust.
3 Relevant interest in beneficial ownership of 350,201 ordinary shares held by Miksha Trust.


All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or,
in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-
executive director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base
member fee as at the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be
purchased within a three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, within a
three-year period from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less
the aggregate sale price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

Materiality assessment
To prioritise Spark’s reporting on sustainability topics we have followed GRI’s materiality principle, set out in GRI 101 to identify and prioritise
topics which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social or economic
impact. Our assessment of material topics included an analysis of stakeholder feedback, a review of industry peers, external expert opinion
and Spark’s view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria. Our identification and assessment of material topics is presented in
the matrix below.

Spark New Zealand Annual Report 2019 Bringing the future faster   Stakeholder engagement




Stakeholder engagement
Over the year Spark has engaged with a broad range of stakeholders, as detailed in the table below. We also engaged with some
stakeholders specifically for the purposes of seeking feedback on this report. In selecting the stakeholders we engaged with, we are guided
by the definition set out in GRI 101: “entities or individuals that can reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by the organisation’s
activities, products, or services; or whose actions can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of the organisation to implement its
strategies or achieve its objectives”.

                                              • The Annual meeting, which allows shareholders a chance to ask questions directly of the Spark Board

Customers                                     We seek regular feedback from customers on their experiences with us and their views of Spark as a
                                              business through our Net Promoter Score methodology and through our Voice of the Customer

                                              We sought specific feedback from industry leaders in the process of preparing this report.
