 there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
 asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable                            Cost
 amount of an individual asset, management estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset                                            Balance as at 1 July 2012                                  5,782            62          490            578           60      6,972

 Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the

 The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield
 curves. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date,
 with the resulting value discounted back to present value. Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to
 determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
