          Investments progressing against three classes of infrastructure assets identified in FY21.


                               Critical network investments that will support future growth in mobile, WBB, and cloud:
                               •   Accelerated 5G rollout: progressing to plan, with ~50% sites to be upgraded by end 2022
                               •   Takanini Datacentre capacity expansion: up to 8MW now contracted and new data hall construction underway
                               •   Mayoral Drive Exchange upgrade: commenced to create a strategically valuable point of interconnect and
                                   develop multi-access edge compute capability



                               Investing in international capacity to keep NZ connected to the world:

          Spark TowerCo – Strategic review update


           STRATEGIC REVIEW UPDATE
           • Spark plans to transfer its passive mobile tower assets into a separate subsidiary, Spark TowerCo
           • Spark’s active mobile assets drive competitiveness – including the core network and radio equipment. Passive mobile assets include
             the physical towers that support this active equipment, and are generally not a source of differentiation in the market
           • Separating these assets into a subsidiary model will improve this utilisation through increased tenancy, while delivering cost
             efficiencies as Spark expands coverage across Aotearoa
           • There will be no change for our customers, and we will continue to invest in modernising our mobile network and improving
             coverage for Aotearoa


           EXPLORING THE INTRODUCTION OF THIRD PARTY CAPITAL
           • Spark intends to commence a process in H2 FY22 to explore the introduction of third party capital into Spark TowerCo
           • If third party capital is introduced, Spark intends to retain a shareholding and will be a key anchor tenant, with appropriate
             agreements in place on arms-length terms for operations and services
           • No decision has been made to introduce third party capital and there is no certainty that a transaction will proceed. The process is
             expected to take a number of months and we will update the market at the conclusion of this process

          (1) Spark’s internal capital management policy is to ensure that on a long-run basis reported net debt to EBITDAI does not exceed 1.4x; which Spark estimates is approximately equivalent to S&P’s 1.7x adjusted net debt to EBITDA threshold Spark’s

          internal threshold of 1.4x excludes S&P’s adjustments in relation to IFRS16, and captive finance operations

          Cloud Accounting Standards Changes
          Implementation of the IFRS interpretations Committee (IFRIC) agenda decision
          During the six months ended 31 December 2021, Spark revised its accounting policy in relation to configuration and customisation costs incurred in
          implementing Software-as-a-Service (‘SaaS’) cloud computing arrangements. This was in response to the IFRIC agenda decision, issued in April 2021, clarifying
          its interpretation of how current accounting standards apply to these types of arrangements. The IFRIC decision clarified that because SaaS arrangements are
          service contracts that provide Spark with the right to access the cloud provider’s application software over the contract period, costs to configure or customise
          this software should be recognised as operating expenses when the services are received.

          Spark had previously recorded these configuration and customisation costs as part of the cost of an intangible asset and amortised these costs over the useful
          life of the software assets. A summary of the impact of the change in accounting policy on Spark’s historical statement of profit or losses provided below.
          Further detail is provided in note 3 of the interim financial statements.
