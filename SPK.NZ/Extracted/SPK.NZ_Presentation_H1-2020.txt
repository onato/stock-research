• Stand-out performance in mobile, securing 5.5% growth in high-margin mobile service revenue. Market share of mobile
  service revenue now at 40.1%, up 1.2pp on prior year(1) - its highest level since 2012;
• Continued growth in cloud, security and service management revenue, up $24m or 12.3% on prior year;
• Entry into sports media via Spark Sport; and
• Moderation in the rate of legacy voice declines as this becomes a smaller part of the Spark business.
