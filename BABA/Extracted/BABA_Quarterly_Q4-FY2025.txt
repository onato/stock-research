We remain committed to advancing multi-modal AI technology and expanding our open-source
initiatives. In April, we launched the Qwen3 series, a new generation of hybrid reasoning models
that combine the capabilities of fast, simple responses and deeper chain-of-thought reasoning
into a single model. The Qwen3 series covers a full range of model sizes, including two MoE
(Mixture-of-Experts) models and six dense models. The flagship MoE model, Qwen3-235B-A22B,
with 235 billion parameters but only 22 billion activated parameters, delivers efficiency and
world-leading performance in key benchmarks such as code generation, mathematics, and
general reasoning. The smaller models, including the dense models and the lightweight MoE
model Qwen3-30B-A3B, are designed for ease of adoption by developers and enterprises, while
delivering strong performance at lower costs. All Qwen3 models have been fully open-sourced on
ModelScope, Hugging Face, and other platforms. We believe the full open-sourcing of Qwen3 will
drive innovation and new applications by developers, start-ups and enterprises.                                                                                                                       9
