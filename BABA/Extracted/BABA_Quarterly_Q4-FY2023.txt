BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES

Starting from the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we have implemented a new organizational and governance
structure, under which we are a holding company of six major business groups and various other businesses,
with each business operating with a high degree of independence (the “Reorganization”). The six major
business groups are:

   •   Taobao and Tmall Group, which includes Taobao, Tmall, Xianyu, 1688.com and other businesses;

   •   Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, which includes Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol,
       Alibaba.com and other businesses;

   •   Local Services Group, which mainly includes the “To-Home” business of Ele.me and the “To-
       Destination” business of Amap;

   •   Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited;

   •   Cloud Intelligence Group, which includes Alibaba Cloud, DingTalk and other businesses; and

   •   Digital Media and Entertainment Group, which includes Youku, Damai and Alibaba Pictures.

Our other businesses include Sun Art, Freshippo, Alibaba Health, Lingxi Games, Intime, Intelligent
Information Platform (which mainly consists of UCWeb and Quark businesses), Fliggy and other
businesses. Accordingly, our segment reporting has been updated to reflect how our chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”) reviews information under this new structure.

Taobao and Tmall Group

Our Taobao and Tmall Group’s strategy is to put users first, build a prosperous ecosystem and realize
technology-driven innovation. Taobao app is at the core of this strategy as we build mindshare as a one-stop
destination for consumption and daily life needs serving the largest number of users. In fiscal year 2024, we
remain focused on improving the customer value proposition of the Taobao app by (i) increasing media
content that strengthens consumer engagement, (ii) enhancing price competitiveness through effective
targeting and introduction of new marketing features and (iii) catering to consumers’ time-sensitive needs
for high-frequency everyday necessities through our neighborhood businesses.

For the month ended June 30, 2023, Taobao app grew average daily active users (DAU) by 6.5% year-over-
year, resulting from effective user acquisition programs and improving retention of Taobao app users during
the quarter. Importantly, the improvements in user acquisition and retention supported a successful 6.18
Shopping Festival that generated solid growth in order volume and average order value. The 6.18 Shopping
Festival enjoyed increasing purchasing demands from a broader range of consumers, including 88VIP
members. During the festival, spending by 88VIP members grew double digits, while the number of paying
subscribers also recorded strong growth. The 6.18 Shopping Festival also gained strong support from
existing and new merchants offering rich assortment of price competitive products as well as creators
introducing new interactive content.

Xianyu (闲鱼), a fun community and marketplace, continues to grow strongly with DAU up 18% year-over-
year during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Through Xianyu, users can find a rich variety of secondhand,
recycled, for-rent and vintage products as well as interest-based content.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (“AIDC”) operates various retail and wholesale platforms to
empower brands, merchants and SMEs to serve global buyers and consumers through wide product selection

                                                      2
and differentiated customer experiences. During the June quarter, the combined order growth of AIDC’s
retail businesses was around 25% year-over-year, driven by solid performance from all major retail
platforms.

AliExpress delivered robust order growth driven by growth of transacting users and enhanced consumer
experience. During the quarter, AliExpress’ Choice continued to upgrade consumer experience with price
competitiveness and improved service standards, through supply chain optimization and parcel consolidation
in key strategic countries. These convenient services enhanced consumer experience and significantly
improved AliExpress’ user retention rate and purchase frequency.

Lazada recorded double-digit order growth year-over-year during the quarter. Lazada continued to improve
monetization rate by offering more value-added services to merchants. As a result of improving
monetization and operating efficiency, Lazada’s unit economics continued to improve compared to the same
period last year.

Trendyol continued to deliver strong order growth driven by growth in both its e-commerce and local
consumer services businesses. Through robust revenue growth and continuing improvement in operating
efficiency, for the first time, Trendyol achieved positive operating results during the quarter.

Local Services Group
For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, revenue from Local Services Group grew 30% year-over-year to
RMB14,450 million (US$1,993 million), driven by strong revenue growth in both Ele.me and Amap
businesses. During this quarter, order growth of Local Services Group exceeded 35% year-over-year.
Annual active consumers of Local Services Group for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 continued to
grow quarter over quarter, due to more efficient acquisition and retention of consumers as well as increasing
user demand. For this quarter, its losses continued to narrow driven by improving overall business scale and
efficiency.

To-Home
During this quarter, Ele.me experienced GMV growth year-over-year, primarily due to strong order growth
that benefited from improving consumer demand, increasing number of active merchants and improving
delivery capacity. Ele.me continues to focus on diversifying the availability of quality items from non-
restaurant categories. During this quarter, Ele.me increased its supply of consumer electronics by
onboarding authorized Apple franchise stores and Suning.com offline stores. For the quarter ended June 30,
2023, Ele.me’s unit economics per order continued to be positive and order density continued to improve.
As a result, Ele.me’s losses continued to narrow year-over-year.

To-Destination
For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, order growth of Amap increased rapidly year-over-year, due to its new
position and additional capabilities as a comprehensive “To-Destination” service platform, as well as due to
the strong recovery in commuting and travel demand. During the Labor Day holiday in May 2023, Amap
achieved over 200 million peak daily active users, the highest number of daily active users compared to
Labor Day holidays in previous years, as the Chinese economy experienced strong recovery in travel
demand.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited

For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, revenue from Cainiao grew 34% year-over-year to RMB23,164 million
(US$3,194 million), primarily driven by the increase of revenue from international fulfillment solution
services as well as domestic consumer logistics services. Contribution to revenue growth came from external
customers as well as Alibaba-consolidated businesses.



                                                      3
Cainiao has a global end-to-end logistics network at scale that uses its proprietary technology to optimize
efficiencies across first-mile pick-up, line haul, overseas distribution, and last-mile delivery. During the
quarter, Cainiao supported merchants on AliExpress’ Choice by offering services with lower costs and faster
delivery, including the recently-launched flagship service of “5-Day Global Delivery.” In June 2023,
Cainiao commenced operation of three new international sorting centers, bringing the number of overseas
sorting centers in operation to 18.

In China, Cainiao continues to expand its value-added services to enhance consumer experience. During the
quarter, Cainiao prioritized the development of fulfillment services, offering “Half-Day Delivery” and
“Next-Day Delivery” in key strategic cities. Consumers can enjoy time-guaranteed doorstep delivery
services.

Cloud Intelligence Group
For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, total revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group, which consists of
revenue from customers within and beyond our ecosystem, was RMB25,123 million (US$3,465 million), a
growth of 4% year-over-year.

Alibaba Cloud

During this quarter, from a product perspective, the year-over-year revenue growth of Alibaba Cloud
excluding revenue from Alibaba-consolidated businesses was driven by storage, networks and AI computing
related products, partly offset by the normalization of CDN demand compared to the same period last year.
From a customer base perspective, the growth was driven by revenue from the financial services, education,
electric power, and automobile industries, partly offset by our proactive efforts to manage revenue from
project-based cloud services.

Alibaba Cloud has been committed to the research and development of core technologies of cloud
computing, big data and AI, as well as promoting customer adoption of cloud computing and AI services.
With rapid development in AI-generated content, we made the following progress in building a model
community, research and development in our large language models and supporting industry development
during this quarter:

•   AI Community: ModelScope (魔搭), our open-source platform providing a large number of machine-
    learning and deep learning models, tools and services, hosted over 1,000 AI models and received in
    aggregate over 45 million downloads as of July 2023. The platform is one of China’s leading online
    community for open-source model resources and allows developers to train and experiment with the
    models by leveraging Alibaba Cloud's AI computing capabilities.
•   Generative AI: Alibaba Cloud announced a series of new features for our generative AI model. Since
    unveiling Tongyi Qianwen (通义千问) in April 2023, Alibaba Cloud upgraded its audio transcription
    platform Tingwu (听悟) with AI-powered meeting analysis capability. In July, Alibaba Cloud launched
    its generative AI text-to-image model Tongyi Wanxiang (通义万相).
•   AI for Science: During this quarter, Fudan University and Alibaba Cloud jointly launched one of the
    largest cloud-based scientific research and intelligent computing platforms for universities in China.
    Leveraging our AI infrastructure and services, Alibaba Cloud supports scientific research to improve
    efficiency and reduce cost, and promotes the development and adoption of large language models in
    scientific research.
Additionally, in June 2023, Forrester released its report “The Forrester Wave™: Functions-As-A-Service
Platforms, Q2 2023.” Alibaba Cloud received the highest score possible in 26 out of 40 criteria with its
product capabilities of Function Compute, and was placed in the Leaders category for service providers
globally.



                                                     4
DingTalk

DingTalk, our intelligent collaboration workplace and application development platform, offers new ways of
working, sharing and collaboration for modern enterprises and organizations. During this quarter, DingTalk
integrated the capabilities of Tongyi Qianwen and offered beta testing access to enterprise customers.
DingTalk will further help customers and ecosystem partners to unlock the potential of AI capabilities.

Digital Media and Entertainment Group
During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, revenue of Digital Media and Entertainment Group was RMB5,381
million (US$742 million), reflecting growth in our online entertainment business and strong recovery of
offline entertainment business.

During the quarter, Youku’s total subscription revenue grew 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by
increasing ARPU as well as benefiting from high-quality original content. Till the End of the Moon (长月烬
明), exclusive in China on Youku, ranked No. 1 in terms of viewership among all TV series broadcasted on
online video platforms in China during the quarter.

Damai, a leading online ticketing platform for live events in China, saw strong revenue recovery, driven by
increasing demand for offline entertainment events, which grew rapidly compared to the same period last
year.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, revenue from Alibaba Pictures’ movie and online platform business
grew strongly year-over-year due to the launch of several blockbusters and robust China box office
demands. Lost in the Stars (消失的她), a movie for which Alibaba Pictures is a co-producer and the leading
promoter and distributor, was the top performer in terms of box office in China during the quarter.

Updates on ESG Initiatives
In July, we published our 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance Report. The report provides updates
on our seven key ESG strategic dimensions, including progress and performance in key initiatives such as
our carbon neutrality pledges. The full version of the report is available on our official website.

In fiscal year 2023, we achieved solid reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2)
and value chain emission intensity (Scope 3). We also made significant progress in driving a total of 22.907
million MtCO2e of emission reduction across our business ecosystem, roughly equivalent to the total annual
greenhouse gas emissions of one million average households in China. Our Low-carbon Friendly Program
brings together 1.91 million products from 409 brands. Through our Carbon88 ledger platform, 187 million
consumers have participated in our Scope 3+ emission reduction efforts.

Share Repurchases
During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 35.6 million ADSs (the equivalent of 284.4 million
ordinary shares) for US$3.1 billion under our share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2023, we had 20.4
billion ordinary shares (the equivalent of 2.5 billion ADSs) outstanding, a reduction of 136.8 million
ordinary shares (the equivalent of 17.1 million ADSs) from last quarter, and US$16.3 billion remained under
the current share buyback program authorized by the Board, which is effective through March 2025.

Other Updates
Ant Group Share Repurchase

In July 2023, the Company received notice from Ant Group of a shareholder meeting to approve, among
other things, a proposal to repurchase from all of its shareholders up to 7.6% of Ant Group’s equity interest,
with a repurchase price that implies the equity value of Ant Group at RMB567.1 billion. The shares


                                                      5
repurchased will be allocated to employee incentive plans of Ant Group. Given Ant Group continues to be
an important strategic partner to our various businesses, we have decided and announced on July 23, 2023 to
not sell any shares to Ant Group under its proposed share repurchase. As of the date of this results
announcement, the completion of these transactions is still pending.

Appointment of Independent Auditor

With the approval of our audit committee and board of directors, we have appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers as our auditors for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2024 for U.S. financial reporting and Hong Kong financial reporting purposes,
respectively. Previously, our auditor for both U.S. financial reporting and Hong Kong financial reporting
purposes was PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 Taobao and Tmall Group

 (i)       Segment revenue

       •   China Commerce Retail Business

           Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was
           RMB109,828 million (US$15,146 million), an increase of 13% compared to RMB97,423 million in
           the same quarter of 2022.

           Customer management revenue increased by 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in
           merchant’s willingness to invest in advertising and increase in online physical goods GMV generated
           on Taobao and Tmall, excluding unpaid order. The growth also reflected a successful 6.18 Shopping
           Festival that generated solid growth in order volume and average order value.

           Direct sales and others revenue under China commerce retail business in the quarter ended June 30,
           2023 was RMB30,167 million (US$4,160 million), an increase of 21% compared to RMB24,998
           million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to strong sales driven by the consumer electronics
           category.

                                                                9
       •   China Commerce Wholesale Business

           Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was
           RMB5,125 million (US$707 million), an increase of 1% compared to RMB5,094 million in the same
           quarter of 2022.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Taobao and Tmall Group adjusted EBITA increased by 9% to RMB49,319 million (US$6,801
           million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to RMB45,219 million in the same quarter of
           2022. The increase was primarily due to the increase in profit from customer management service
           and narrowing losses in certain businesses.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group

(i)        Segment revenue

       •   International Commerce Retail Business

           Revenue from our International commerce retail business in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was
           RMB17,138 million (US$2,364 million), an increase of 60% compared to RMB10,742 million in the
           same quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to strong combined order growth of retail
           businesses driven by solid performance of all major retail platforms, and improvements in
           monetization. Because certain of our international businesses generate revenue in local currencies
           while our reporting currency is Renminbi, AIDC’s revenue is affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

       •   International Commerce Wholesale Business

           Revenue from our International commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended June 30, 2023
           was RMB4,985 million (US$687 million), which remained stable compared to RMB4,979 million in
           the same quarter of 2022.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB420 million
           (US$58 million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB1,380 million in the
           same quarter of 2022. Losses significantly narrowed year-over-year primarily because of improved
           margins of Trendyol and Lazada, partly offset by the increase in investments in new business, such
           as Miravia, and AliExpress. Trendyol continued to deliver strong order growth in both of its e-
           commerce and local consumer services businesses. Through robust revenue growth and continuing
           improvement in operating efficiency, for the first time, Trendyol achieved positive operating results
           during the quarter. The reduced loss from Lazada is primarily due to improvement in monetization.

Local Services Group

(i)        Segment revenue

           Revenue from Local Services Group was RMB14,450 million (US$1,993 million) in the quarter
           ended June 30, 2023, an increase of 30% compared to RMB11,131 million in the same quarter of
           2022, primarily due to robust GMV growth of Ele.me and the rapid order growth of Amap.

       quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB2,834 million in the same quarter of 2022,
       reflecting the continued narrowing of losses driven by Ele.me’s order growth and positive unit
       economics per order, as well as rapid order growth of Amap driven by market demand.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited

(i)    Segment revenue

       Revenue from Cainiao Smart Network Logistics Limited was RMB23,164 million (US$3,194
       million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, increased by 34% compared to RMB17,292 million in
       the same quarter of 2022, primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from international
       fulfillment solution services and domestic consumer logistics services.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited adjusted EBITA was a profit of RMB877 million
       (US$121 million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB185 million in the

       ended June 30, 2023, increased by 4% compared to RMB24,127 million in the same quarter of 2022.
       Year-over-year revenue growth was mainly driven by Alibaba-consolidated businesses and
       customers within financial services, education, electric power, and automobile industries, partly
       offset by our proactive efforts to manage revenue from project-based cloud services.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Cloud Intelligence Group adjusted EBITA increased by 106% to RMB387 million (US$53 million)
       in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to RMB188 million in the same quarter of 2022,
       primarily due to reduced colocation and bandwidth costs of DingTalk as a result of normalization of
       usage as compared to the same quarter last year.

Digital Media and Entertainment Group

(i)    Segment revenue

       Revenue from Digital Media and Entertainment Group was RMB5,381 million (US$742 million) in
       the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of 36% compared to RMB3,966 million in the same
       quarter of 2022, primarily driven by growth in our online entertainment business and strong recovery
       of offline entertainment business.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Pictures and Damai.

(i)    Segment revenue

       Revenue from all others segment was RMB45,541 million (US$6,280 million) in the quarter ended
       June 30, 2023, which increased slightly by 1% compared to RMB45,152 million in the same quarter
       of 2022, primarily due to the revenue growth contributed by Alibaba Health, Fliggy, Freshippo and
       Intelligent Information Platform, partly offset by the decrease in revenue from Sun Art due to
       decrease in ticket size resulted from the decrease in consumer stockpiling behavior compared to the
       same quarter last year.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Adjusted EBITA from all others segment in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was a loss of
       RMB1,204 million (US$166 million), compared to a loss of RMB2,275 million in the same quarter

(US$19,631 million), or 61% of revenue, compared to RMB129,657 million, or 63% of revenue, in the same
quarter of 2022. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a percentage of

revenue, in the same quarter of 2022. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have remained stable at 4% in the
quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2022.

Share-based compensation expense – Total share-based compensation expense included in the cost and
expense items above in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was a net reversal of RMB1,629 million (US$225

The following table sets forth our analysis of share-based compensation expense for the quarters indicated
by type of share-based awards:

 By type of awards:
 Alibaba Group share-based
    awards(1)                             5,615          2%          4,267        588          2%          (24)%

 (1) This represents Alibaba Group share-based awards granted to our employees.
 (2) This represents Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, which is subject to mark-to-market
     accounting treatment.
 (3) This represents share-based awards of our subsidiaries.

Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards decreased in the quarter
ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the general
decrease in the average fair market value of the awards granted.

Share-based compensation expense related to Ant Group reflected a reversal of share-based compensation
expense of RMB6,901 million (US$952 million) for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This is the result of a
mark-to-market adjustment during the quarter relating to Ant Group share-based awards granted to our
employees because of a decrease in the value of Ant Group.

We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair
value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.




                                                              14
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended June 30, 2023
was RMB2,479 million (US$342 million), a decrease of 10% from RMB2,751 million in the same quarter of
2022.

Impairment of goodwill – Impairment of goodwill of RMB2,031 million (US$280 million) was recorded in
the quarter ended June 30, 2023 because the carrying value of a reporting unit within all others segment
exceeded its fair value.

Income from operations and operating margin

Income from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB42,490 million (US$5,860 million), or
18% of revenue, an increase of 70% compared to RMB24,943 million, or 12% of revenue, in the same
quarter of 2022, primarily contributed by revenue growth, increase in operating efficiency and the reversal
of share-based compensation expense of RMB6,901 million (US$952 million) related to the mark-to-market
adjustment during the quarter relating to Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees. We
excluded share-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measurements. Excluding the reversal of
share-based compensation expense, our income from operations would have increased by 43% year-over-
year, from RMB24,943 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2022 to RMB35,589 million (US$4,908
million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA

Adjusted EBITDA increased 27% year-over-year to RMB52,052 million (US$7,178 million) in the quarter
ended June 30, 2023, compared to RMB41,114 million in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITA
increased 32% year-over-year to RMB45,371 million (US$6,257 million) in the quarter ended June 30,
2023, compared to RMB34,419 million in the same quarter of 2022. The year-over-year increase was
primarily contributed by revenue growth and increase in operating efficiency. A reconciliation of net income
to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is included at the end of this results announcement.

Adjusted EBITA by segments

Adjusted EBITA by segments as well as a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted EBITA are
set forth in the section entitled “June Quarter Segment Results” above.

Interest and investment income, net

Interest and investment income, net in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was a loss of RMB5,898 million
(US$814 million), compared to a gain of RMB5,369 million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to
net losses arising from decreases in market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies,
compared to net gains from these investments in the same quarter last year.

The above-mentioned gains and losses were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.

Other income, net

Other income, net in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB1,364 million (US$188 million), compared
to RMB109 million in the same quarter of 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the
decrease in net exchange losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation between Renminbi and U.S. dollar.

Income tax expenses

Income tax expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 were RMB6,022 million (US$830 million),
compared to RMB5,399 million in the same quarter of 2022.



                                                     15
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments,
impairment of goodwill and investments, as well as the deferred tax effects on basis differences arising from
our equity method investees, our effective tax rate would have been 17% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

Share of results of equity method investees

Share of results of equity method investees in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was a profit of RMB2,850
million (US$393 million), compared to a loss of RMB3,480 million in the same quarter of 2022. The
following table sets forth a breakdown of share of results of equity method investees for the periods

(1) “Others” mainly include basis differences arising from equity method investees, share-based compensation expense related to share-based
    awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or loss arising from the deemed disposal of the equity method
    investees.

We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The decrease in share of
net losses of other equity method investees was mainly due to the overall improvement in financial
performance of certain of our equity method investees. In July 2023, PRC regulators announced a RMB7.07
billion fine on Ant Group, which was not reflected in our share of results of Ant Group for the quarter ended
June 30, 2023 and will be reflected in our share of results of Ant Group in the quarter which Ant Group
reports to us its results reflecting the fine.

Net income and Non-GAAP net income

Our net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB33,000 million (US$4,551 million), an increase
of 63% compared to RMB20,298 million in the same quarter of 2022. The year-over-year increase was
primarily attributable to the increase in income from operations and the increase in share of results of equity
method investees, partly offset by the net losses arising from the decreases in market prices of our equity
investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to net gains from these investments in the same quarter
last year.

Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments,
impairment of goodwill and investments and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended
June 30, 2023 was RMB44,922 million (US$6,195 million), an increase of 48% compared to RMB30,252
million in the same quarter of 2022. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income is included at
the end of this results announcement.

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB34,332
million (US$4,735 million), an increase of 51% compared to RMB22,739 million in the same quarter of
2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to increase in net income as mentioned above.




                                                                     16
Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share

Diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB13.30 (US$1.83), compared to
RMB8.51 in the same quarter in 2022. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and
disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and investments and certain other items, non-
GAAP diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB17.37 (US$2.40), an increase
of 48% compared to RMB11.73 in the same quarter of 2022.

Diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB1.66 (US$0.23 or HK$1.80),

revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and investments and certain
other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB2.17
(US$0.30 or HK$2.35), an increase of 48% compared to RMB1.47 in the same quarter of 2022.

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share is
included at the end of this results announcement. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments

As of June 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, were RMB584,695
million (US$80,633 million), compared to RMB560,314 million as of March 31, 2023. Other treasury
investments mainly comprise of investments in fixed deposits and certificates of deposits with original
maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and other treasury investments during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to free
cash flow generated from operations of RMB39,089 million (US$5,391 million), and effect of exchange rate
changes of RMB12,148 million (US$1,675 million) mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
Renminbi, partly offset by cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB22,151 million (US$3,055
million) and repayment of unsecured senior notes of US$700 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow

Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was RMB45,306 million
(US$6,248 million), an increase of 34% compared to RMB33,869 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free
cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB39,089 million (US$5,391 million) in the
quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of 76% compared to RMB22,173 million in the same quarter of
2022. The year-over-year increase reflected an increase in profitability and a decrease in capital expenditure.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this
results announcement.

Net cash provided by investing activities

During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities of RMB12,595 million
(US$1,737 million) primarily reflected a decrease in short-term investments by RMB49,393 million
(US$6,812 million) and cash inflow of RMB5,363 million (US$739 million) from disposal of investments.
These cash inflows were partly offset by (i) an increase in other treasury investments by RMB32,597 million
(US$4,495 million), (ii) capital expenditures of RMB6,927 million (US$955 million) and (iii) cash outflow
of RMB2,707 million (US$373 million) for investment and acquisition activities.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to
the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by
the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted
earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our
core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and
operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA,


                                                     20
adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency
to investors about our operating results.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate
transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS
and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from
operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or
as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not
have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures
differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees (ii) certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of
goodwill, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land
use rights, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods
presented.

Adjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and impairment
of goodwill, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods
presented.

Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization of
intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and investments, gain or loss on deemed
disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments and others, as adjusted for the tax effects.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash
flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and
construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through
acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer
protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from
investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating
business operations. We exclude “acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to
office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and
are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection
fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of
compensating buyers for claims against merchants.

The table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP
Measures” in this results announcement have more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are
most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these
financial measures.
