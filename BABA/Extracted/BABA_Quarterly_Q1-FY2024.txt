                  Alibaba Group Announces June Quarter 2024 Results
Hangzhou, China, August 15, 2024 – Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988
(HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced its financial
results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

“Our results this quarter demonstrated our strategy at work. Our focus on enhancing user experience by
offering quality products at attractive prices with great service led to stabilizing market share of Taobao and
Tmall Group as we returned the business on the growth trajectory. The cloud business achieved positive
revenue growth momentum, driven by public cloud and AI-related product adoption as we continue to invest
to maintain our market leadership,” said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.

“In this quarter, we continue to invest for growth in our core businesses while reducing losses in other
business units through operating efficiency. We maintained the integrity of our margins and delivered
consistent adjusted EBITA. We also returned significant value to shareholders at a pace higher than past
quarters, as we made US$5.8 billion of share repurchases that included a concurrent repurchase of shares in
connection with our convertible notes offering. This transaction underscores our confidence in our business
outlook,” said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.


BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

In the quarter ended June 30, 2024:

       •   Revenue was RMB243,236 million (US$33,470 million), an increase of 4% year-over-year.

       •   Income from operations was RMB35,989 million (US$4,952 million), a decrease of 15% or
           RMB6,501 million year-over-year, primarily due to a reversal of share-based compensation
           expense of RMB6,901 million during the same quarter in the prior year, as discussed in “June
           Quarter Other Financial Results” below. We excluded non-cash share-based compensation
           expense from our non-GAAP measurements. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement,
           decreased 1% year-over-year to RMB45,035 million (US$6,197 million).

       •   Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB24,269 million (US$3,340
           million). Net income was RMB24,022 million (US$3,306 million), a decrease of 27% year-over-
           year, primarily due to a decrease in income from operations and the increase in impairment of
           our investments, partly offset by the mark-to-market changes from our equity investments. Non-
           GAAP net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB40,691 million (US$5,599
           million), a decrease of 9% compared to RMB44,922 million in the same quarter of 2023.

       •   Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB9.89 (US$1.36). Diluted earnings per share was
           RMB1.24 (US$0.17 or HK$1.36). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB16.44
           (US$2.26), a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was
           RMB2.05 (US$0.28 or HK$2.25), a decrease of 5% year-over-year.

       •   Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB33,636 million (US$4,628 million), a
           decrease of 26% compared to RMB45,306 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free cash flow, a
           non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB17,372 million (US$2,390 million), a decrease of
           56% compared to RMB39,089 million in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease in free cash
           flow mainly reflected the increase in expenditure related to our investments in Alibaba Cloud

                                                       1
           infrastructure and other working capital changes related to factors including our planned
           reduction of direct sales businesses.

Reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures presented above are included at the end of this
results announcement.

BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES

Taobao and Tmall Group

We increased investment in strategic initiatives such as price-competitive products, customer service,
membership program benefits and technology, with the aim to enhance user experience. These efforts led to
better consumer retention, increased purchase frequency, and positive feedback regarding the overall
shopping experience.

We improved matching of products with user needs and conversion of user traffic to purchases through
investments in technology such as recommendation and matching algorithms, as well as increasing price-
competitive offerings through diversification of suppliers. In April, we launched our new AI-powered
platform-wide marketing tool, Quanzhantui, which features automated bidding, optimized targeting and
performance dashboard visualization. This new product aims at increasing merchants’ marketing spending
and improving their marketing efficiency, and we have observed steady increase in merchant adoption.

During the quarter, we achieved high-single-digit online GMV growth and double-digit order growth year-
over-year, driven by increase in the number of purchasers and purchase frequency. In particular, we had a
successful 6.18 Shopping Festival, which delivered strong online GMV growth year-over-year, as we
implemented user-friendly promotion mechanisms and increased mindshare for being a comprehensive and
price-competitive shopping destination.

The number of 88VIP members continued to increase by double-digits year-over-year, surpassing 42 million
during the quarter. We aim to enlarge our pool of premium shoppers by continuing increasing the
subscription of 88VIP membership and enhancing their purchase willingness through improved benefits and
services.

Cloud Intelligence Group

For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB26,549 million
(US$3,653 million), a growth of 6% year-over-year.

During this quarter, overall revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated subsidiaries grew over 6% year-over-
year, driven by double-digit public cloud growth and increasing adoption of AI-related products. AI-related
product revenue continued to grow at triple-digits year-over-year. We will continue to invest in customers
and technology, particularly in AI infrastructure, to increase cloud adoption for AI and maintain our market
leadership.

Alibaba Cloud has gained notable recognition as the cloud service provider of choice in China for AI
training and applications. According to the recently released 2024 Gartner® “Magic Quadrant™ for Data
Science and Machine Learning Platforms” report, Alibaba Cloud has been mentioned as the only Asia-based
cloud service provider among global players.

Our ongoing commitment to open-source development has led to widespread recognition of our Qwen 2.0
series of large language models among global developers. Qwen 2.0 demonstrates substantial performance
improvements across areas such as reasoning, code generation and mathematics, while enhancing safety
features and expanding to support 27 languages. The number of paying users using Alibaba Cloud’s AI
platform (百炼) increased by over 200% quarter-over-quarter.


                                                      2
During the Paris 2024 Olympics, Alibaba Cloud’s technology, which enables remote video production and
transmission through cloud infrastructure, overtook satellite as the primary means of broadcast for the first
time in Olympics history. Two-thirds of national broadcasters used live signals transmitted by Alibaba
Cloud in real-time around the world, reaching billions of viewers. Alibaba Cloud also hosted more than
11,000 hours of Olympic Broadcasting Services-produced games related video content used by the
broadcasters. Additionally, this is the first Olympic Games to extensively use AI, with Alibaba Cloud’s AI
technology deployed in 14 Olympic venues to generate high-fidelity 360-degree replays in real-time.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (“AIDC”)

For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revenue from AIDC grew 32% year-over-year to RMB29,293 million
(US$4,031 million). The strong performance was driven by growth of cross-border businesses, in particular
the Choice business on AliExpress. During this quarter, our AliExpress and Trendyol platforms stepped up
investments in initiatives to increase mindshare in select markets in Europe and the Gulf region. In addition,
we continued our efforts to improve efficiency of our operations and investment.

The AliExpress platform expanded its supplier base and now includes local merchants to enrich its product
offerings and better meet the needs of local consumers. During the quarter, AliExpress and Magazine Luiza
(“Magalu”), a leading retailer in Brazil, entered into a partnership in which Magalu will open and operate a
storefront on AliExpress and vice versa. In addition, during this quarter, the unit economics of the Choice
business improved significantly on a sequential basis.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited (“Cainiao”)

For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 16% year-over-year to RMB26,811 million
(US$3,689 million), primarily driven by increase in revenue from cross-border fulfillment solutions.

We continue to drive synergies between Cainiao and our cross-border e-commerce business, as Cainiao
executes its strategy to strengthen its end-to-end capabilities through developing a highly-digitalized global
logistics network.

Local Services Group

For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revenue from Local Services Group grew by 12% year-over-year to
RMB16,229 million (US$2,233 million), driven by order growth of both Amap and Ele.me, as well as
revenue growth from marketing services. For this quarter, Local Services Group’s losses narrowed
significantly on a year-over-year basis due to improving operating efficiency and increasing scale.

Digital Media and Entertainment Group

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revenue of Digital Media and Entertainment Group was RMB5,581
million (US$768 million), an increase of 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by GMV and revenue growth
of its online ticketing platform for live events.

ESG Updates

In July, we published our 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance Report. The report provides updates
on our key ESG strategic dimensions, including progress and performance in key initiatives such as our
carbon neutrality pledges. The full version of the report is available on our official website.

Share Repurchases

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 613 million ordinary shares (equivalent to
77 million ADSs) for a total of US$5.8 billion, including the repurchase of approximately US$1.2 billion of


                                                       3
ADSs through privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the issuance of our convertible notes on
May 23, 2024.

As of June 30, 2024, we had 19,024 million ordinary shares (equivalent to 2,378 million ADSs) outstanding,
a net decrease of 445 million ordinary shares compared to March 31, 2024, or a 2.3% net reduction in our
outstanding shares after accounting for shares issued under our ESOP.

(2) The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a reversal of share-based compensation expense of RMB6,901 million during
    the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as discussed in “June Quarter Other Financial Results” below.
(3) The year-over-year decreases were primarily attributable to the increase in investments in our e-commerce businesses, partly
    offset by improved operating efficiency.
(4) The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to a decrease in income from operations and the increase in impairment of
    our investments, partly offset by the mark-to-market changes from our equity investments, while net income attributable to
    ordinary shareholders and earnings per share/ADS would further take into account the net loss attributable to noncontrolling
    interests. We excluded non-cash share-based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and
    intangible assets, and certain other items from our non-GAAP measurements.
(5) Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.
(6) The year-over-year percentages as stated are calculated based on the exact amount and there may be minor differences from
    the year-over-year percentages calculated based on the RMB amounts after rounding.

    segment performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.

(1) Starting from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we reclassified the results of our DingTalk business, which was previously
    reported under Cloud Intelligence Group, to All others, the purpose of which was to provide DingTalk with greater autonomy
    to promote innovation and enhance competitiveness. Our CODM started to review information under this new reporting
    structure and segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change as well as the way we manage and monitor segment
    performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.
(2) All others include Sun Art, Freshippo, Alibaba Health, Lingxi Games, Intime, Intelligent Information Platform (which mainly
    consists of UCWeb and Quark businesses), Fliggy, DingTalk (previously reported under Cloud Intelligence Group segment)
    and other businesses.
(3) Unallocated primarily relates to certain costs incurred by corporate functions and other miscellaneous items that are not
    allocated to individual segments.
(4) For a more intuitive presentation, widening of loss in YoY% is shown in terms of negative growth rate, and narrowing of loss
    in YoY% is shown in terms of positive growth rate.
Taobao and Tmall Group

(i) Segment revenue

    •   China Commerce Retail Business

        Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was
        RMB107,421 million (US$14,782 million), a decrease of 2% compared to RMB109,828 million in
        the same quarter of 2023 due to the 9% decrease in direct sales revenue described below.

        Customer management revenue increased by 1% year-over-year, primarily due to a high-single-digit
        year-over-year growth in online GMV, partly offset by a decline in take rate. The year-over-year
        decrease in take rate was primarily due to increasing proportion of GMV generated from new models
        that currently have lower monetization rates.

        Direct sales and others revenue under China commerce retail business in the quarter ended June 30,
        2024 was RMB27,306 million (US$3,758 million), a decrease of 9% compared to RMB30,167
        million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to the decline in sales of consumer



                                                                 7
       electronics and appliances due to our planned reduction of certain direct sales businesses, partly
       offset by the increase in sales of groceries.

   •   China Commerce Wholesale Business

       Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was
       RMB5,952 million (US$819 million), an increase of 16% compared to RMB5,125 million in the
       same quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in revenue from value-added services provided to
       paying members.

(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA

       Taobao and Tmall Group adjusted EBITA decreased by 1% to RMB48,810 million (US$6,716
       million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB49,319 million in the same quarter of
       2023, primarily due to the increase in investments in user experience (which resulted in enhanced
       consumer retention and increased purchase frequency) and technology infrastructure, partly offset by
       the narrowing losses in certain businesses.

Cloud Intelligence Group

(i) Segment revenue

       Revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB26,549 million (US$3,653 million) in the quarter
       ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 6% compared to RMB25,065 million in the same quarter of
       2023. Overall revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated subsidiaries increased by 6% year-over-year,
       mainly driven by the double-digit revenue growth of public cloud products including AI-related
       products, partly offset by the decrease in non-public cloud revenue as we transition away from the
       low-margin project-based revenues to focus on high-quality revenues.

(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA

       Cloud Intelligence Group adjusted EBITA increased by 155% to RMB2,337 million (US$322
       million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB916 million in the same quarter of
       2023, primarily due to improving product mix through our focus on public cloud adoption and
       operating efficiency, partly offset by the increasing investments in customers and technology.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group

(i) Segment revenue

   •   International Commerce Retail Business

       Revenue from our International commerce retail business in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was
       RMB23,691 million (US$3,260 million), an increase of 38% compared to RMB17,138 million in the
       same quarter of 2023, primarily driven by order growth from AliExpress’ Choice, as well as
       improvements in monetization. As certain of our international businesses generate revenue in local
       currencies while our reporting currency is Renminbi, AIDC’s revenue is affected by exchange rate
       fluctuations.

   •   International Commerce Wholesale Business

       Revenue from our International commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended June 30, 2024
       was RMB5,602 million (US$771 million), an increase of 12% compared to RMB4,985 million in the
       same quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by cross-border-related
       value-added services.

      (US$510 million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a loss of RMB420 million in the
      same quarter of 2023, primarily due to the increase in investments in AliExpress and Trendyol’s
      cross-border businesses, partly offset by Lazada’s significant reduction in operating loss from
      improvements in its monetization and operating efficiency.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited

(i) Segment revenue

      Revenue from Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited was RMB26,811 million (US$3,689
      million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 16% compared to RMB23,164 million in

      solutions.

(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA

      Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited adjusted EBITA decreased by 30% to RMB618 million
      (US$85 million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB877 million in the same
      quarter of 2023, primarily due to increased investments in cross-border fulfillment solutions, partly
      offset by improved operating efficiency.

Local Services Group

      ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 12% compared to RMB14,450 million in the same quarter of

Cost of revenue – Cost of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB146,106 million
(US$20,105 million), or 60.1% of revenue, compared to RMB142,347 million, or 60.8% of revenue, in the
same quarter of 2023. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a
percentage of revenue would have decreased from 60.9% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 to 59.8% in the
quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Product development expenses – Product development expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were
RMB13,373 million (US$1,840 million), or 5.5% of revenue, compared to RMB10,465 million, or 4.5% of
revenue, in the same quarter of 2023. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product
development expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 4.6% in the quarter ended
June 30, 2023 to 4.8% in the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Sales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were
RMB32,696 million (US$4,499 million), or 13.4% of revenue, compared to RMB27,047 million, or 11.6%
of revenue, in the same quarter of 2023. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, sales and

marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 11.6% in the quarter ended June
30, 2023 to 13.3% in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to our increased investments in e-
commerce businesses.

General and administrative expenses – General and administrative expenses in the quarter ended June 30,
2024 were RMB13,280 million (US$1,827 million), or 5.5% of revenue, compared to RMB7,297 million, or
3.1% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2023. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 3.5% in the
quarter ended June 30, 2023 to 4.9% in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to a one-time
provision for the previously disclosed shareholder class action lawsuits of RMB3,145 million (US$433
million) during the quarter.

Share-based compensation expense – Total share-based compensation expense included in the cost and
expense items above in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB4,131 million (US$568 million),
compared to a net reversal of RMB1,629 million in the same quarter of 2023.

(1) This represents Alibaba Group share-based awards granted to our employees.
(2) This represents Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, which is subject to mark-to-market accounting
    treatment.
(3) This represents share-based awards of our subsidiaries.


Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards decreased in the quarter
ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the general
decrease in the average fair market value and number of the awards granted.

Share-based compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based awards was a net reversal for the
quarter ended June 30, 2023 because we made a mark-to-market adjustment during the quarter relating to
Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, reflecting a decrease in the value of Ant Group.

We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair
value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.

Amortization and impairment of intangible assets – Amortization and impairment of intangible assets in
the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB1,792 million (US$247 million), a decrease of 28% from
RMB2,479 million in the same quarter of 2023.

Impairment of goodwill – Impairment of goodwill of RMB2,031 million was recorded in the quarter ended
June 30, 2023 because the carrying value of a reporting unit within All others segment exceeded its fair
value.



                                                              12
Income from operations and operating margin

Income from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB35,989 million (US$4,952 million), or
15% of revenue, a decrease of 15% compared to RMB42,490 million, or 18% of revenue, in the same
quarter of 2023, primarily due to the reversal of share-based compensation expense of RMB6,901 million
during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 in relation to the mark-to-market adjustment of Ant Group share-
based awards granted to our employees.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA

Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% year-over-year to RMB51,161 million (US$7,040 million) in the quarter
ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB52,052 million in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITA
decreased 1% year-over-year to RMB45,035 million (US$6,197 million) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024,
compared to RMB45,371 million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to the increase in
investments in our e-commerce businesses, partly offset by improved operating efficiency. A reconciliation
of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is included at the end of this results announcement.

Adjusted EBITA by segment

Adjusted EBITA by segment as well as a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted EBITA are
set forth in the section entitled “June Quarter Segment Results” above.

Interest and investment income, net

Interest and investment income, net in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was a loss of RMB1,478 million
(US$203 million), compared to a loss of RMB5,898 million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily due to a
decrease in net loss from our investments in publicly-traded companies as a result of mark-to-market
changes.

The above-mentioned investment gains and losses were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.

Other income, net

Other income, net in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB257 million (US$35 million), a decrease of
81% compared to RMB1,364 million in the same quarter of 2023.

Income tax expenses

compared to RMB6,022 million in the same quarter of 2023.

Share of results of equity method investees

Share of results of equity method investees in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB1,505 million
(US$207 million), a decrease of 47% compared to RMB2,850 million in the same quarter of 2023. The
following table sets forth a breakdown of share of results of equity method investees for the periods

    share-based awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or loss arising from the deemed
    disposal of the equity method investees.
We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. We recorded an
impairment loss of RMB2,157 million (US$297 million) in this quarter with respect to equity method
investees, primarily due to a prolonged decline in the public market value of an equity method investee
against its carrying value.

Net income and Non-GAAP net income

Our net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB24,022 million (US$3,306 million), compared
to RMB33,000 million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in income from operations,
and the increase in impairment of our investments, partly offset by the mark-to-market changes from our
equity investments.

Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets, and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was
RMB40,691 million (US$5,599 million), a decrease of 9% compared to RMB44,922 million in the same
quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this
results announcement.

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB24,269
million (US$3,340 million), compared to RMB34,332 million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily due to
a decrease in income from operations, and the increase in impairment of our investments, partly offset by the
mark-to-market changes from our equity investments.

Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share

Diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB9.89 (US$1.36), compared to
RMB13.30 in the same quarter of 2023. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense,
gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and certain other items, non-
GAAP diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB16.44 (US$2.26), a decrease
of 5% compared to RMB17.37 in the same quarter of 2023.

Diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB1.24 (US$0.17 or HK$1.36),
compared to RMB1.66 in the same quarter of 2023. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense,
gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and certain other items, non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was RMB2.05 (US$0.28 or HK$2.25),
a decrease of 5% compared to RMB2.17 in the same quarter of 2023.

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share is
included at the end of this results announcement. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

                                                              14
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments

As of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, were RMB613,678
million (US$84,445 million), compared to RMB617,230 million as of March 31, 2024. Other treasury
investments consist of fixed deposits, certificate of deposits and marketable debt securities with original
maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and other treasury investments during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to
cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB42,695 million (US$5,875 million) and acquisition of
additional equity interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries of RMB8,337 million (US$1,147 million),
partly offset by free cash flow generated from operations of RMB17,372 million (US$2,390 million) and the
net proceeds from the issuance of convertible unsecured senior notes and the purchase of capped call of
RMB31,065 million (US$4,275 million).

Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was RMB33,636 million
(US$4,628 million), a decrease of 26% compared to RMB45,306 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free
cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB17,372 million (US$2,390 million), a decrease
of 56% compared to RMB39,089 million in the same quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease mainly
reflected the increase in expenditure related to our investments in Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and other
working capital changes related to factors including our planned reduction of direct sales businesses. A
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this
results announcement.

Net cash used in investing activities

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of RMB35,829 million
(US$4,930 million) primarily reflected (i) an increase in other treasury investments by RMB112,148 million
(US$15,432 million), (ii) capital expenditure of RMB12,094 million (US$1,664 million), and (iii) cash
outflow of RMB1,769 million (US$243 million) for investment and acquisition activities. These cash
outflows were partly offset by a decrease in short-term investments by RMB87,417 million (US$12,029
million) and cash inflow of RMB2,496 million (US$343 million) from disposal of investments.

Net cash used in financing activities

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of RMB19,582 million
(US$2,695 million) primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB42,695 million
(US$5,875 million) and acquisition of additional equity interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries of
RMB8,337 million (US$1,147 million), partly offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible
unsecured senior notes and the purchase of capped call of RMB31,065 million (US$4,275 million).

Employees

As of June 30, 2024, we had a total of 198,162 employees, compared to 204,891 as of March 31, 2024.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to
the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by
the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted
earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our
core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and
operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA,


                                                       17
adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency
to investors about our operating results.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate
transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS
and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from
operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or
as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not
have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures
differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses, share of results of equity method investees, certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible
assets, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease
cost relating to land use rights, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary
course of business), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the
periods presented.

Adjusted EBITA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other
income, net, income tax expenses, share of results of equity method investees, certain non-cash expenses,
consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets,
impairment of goodwill, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of
business), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods
presented.

Non-GAAP net income represents net income before non-cash share-based compensation expense,
amortization and impairment of intangible assets, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of
investments, impairment of goodwill and investments, and others (including provision in relation to matters
outside the ordinary course of business), and adjustments for the tax effects.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash
flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and
construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through
acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer
protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from
investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating
business operations. We exclude “acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to
office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and
are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection
fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of
compensating buyers for claims against merchants.

Measures” in this results announcement has more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most

measures.
