       Notes:
       (1) Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.
       (2) Diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, on a diluted basis. Diluted earnings per ADS is derived
             from the diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
       (3) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-GAAP diluted
             earnings per share, on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

    Notes:
    (1) Direct sales, logistics and others revenue under Alibaba China E-commerce Group primarily represents direct sales businesses of Tmall Supermarket, Tmall Global and other businesses, where revenue and cost
          of inventory are recorded on a gross basis within the business group, as well as revenue from logistics services and value-added services.
    (2) Quick commerce revenue represents quick commerce business revenue, including revenue generated through “Taobao Instant Commerce” and the Ele.me app. Quick commerce revenue is net of subsidies
          that are contra revenue.
    (3) All others include Freshippo, Cainiao, Alibaba Health, Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, Amap, Intelligent Information Platform (which mainly consists of UCWeb and Quark businesses), Lingxi
          Games, DingTalk and other businesses. The majority of revenue within All others consists of direct sales, where revenue and cost of inventory are recorded on a gross basis, and revenue from logistics services.
          The decrease was primarily due to the revenue decrease as a result of the disposal of Sun Art and Intime businesses, as well as the decrease in revenue from Cainiao, partly offset by the increase in revenue
          from Freshippo, Alibaba Health and Amap.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              12

Notes:
(1) Non-GAAP adjustments excluding the attributions to the noncontrolling interests. See the table above for items regarding the reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income (before excluding the attributions to the
      noncontrolling interests).
(2) Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.
(3) Diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, on a diluted basis. Diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the
      diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
(4) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-GAAP diluted earnings
      per share, on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
