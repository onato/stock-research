     Social responsibility is deeply embedded into Alibaba DNA. As a platform we innately facilitate social interactions,
     and the extensive cooperation amongst the many types of participants on our platform has not only brought
     about innovation and the emergence of new types of businesses, it has also created massive employment
     opportunities. Despite the tremendous uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and other reasons, we
     expect to have over 5,800 fresh college graduates joining Alibaba this year.(1) In 2021, alongside China’s historic
     achievement of comprehensive poverty alleviation, we upgraded the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund into a Rural
     Revitalization Fund. We supported rural revitalization through the three dimensions of industrial revitalization,
     talent revitalization and technology revitalization. We also put forth ten key initiatives in the latter half of last year.
     Through the mobilization of multiple businesses and long-term planning, we aim to implement our initiatives
     steadily and step-by-step taking into consideration both commercial value and social value. We will start in
     Zhejiang, focusing on technological innovation, economic development, job creation and care for vulnerable
     populations. Whether it is the flood in Henan or the pandemic in Shanghai, we have done everything we can to
     contribute to support the needs of people’s lives through the commercial infrastructure and capabilities that we
     have accumulated over the years.

      Starting from the quarter ended December 31, 2021, our CODM started to review information under a new reporting structure, and
      segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change, which also provides greater transparency in our business progress
      and financial performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.
      (1) Unallocated expenses primarily relate to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated
          to individual segments. The goodwill impairment is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information because our
          management does not consider this as part of the segment operating performance measure.

          non-GAAP diluted earnings per share divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on
          a diluted basis for computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the
          non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjustment to the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Hong Kong IPO, we established a branch register

      Report of Independent Registered Public
      Accounting Firm




      To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alibaba Group Holding Limited

      Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its
      subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated income statements,
      consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each
      of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as
      the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial
      reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
      issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
      flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
      respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
      Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

      Basis for Opinions
      The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
      effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
      over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      appearing under the section of “Controls and Procedures” in the Company’s annual report. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal
      control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
      Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect
      to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
      the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
      and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
      are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
      financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.




295   Alibaba Group Holding Limited
                        Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements
and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report    296
      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



      Impairment Assessment on Goodwill Relating to Reporting Units under the Digital Media and
      Entertainment Segment
      As described in Note 2(y) and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, as a result of the annual
      impairment test, the Company recognized goodwill impairment charges of RMB25,141 million relating to one
      listed and one unlisted reporting units under the Digital media and entertainment segment during the year
      ended March 31, 2022. The fair value of the unlisted reporting unit is determined using the income approach,
      which is based on the discounted cash flow analysis derived from management’s best estimate of the future
      growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the listed reporting unit is determined based
      on its market capitalization, adjusted for control premium.

      The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment
      assessment on goodwill relating to reporting units under the Digital media and entertainment segment is a
      critical audit matter are the significant judgment and estimation made by management when determining the
      fair values of these reporting units, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and
      effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the future growth rates, the weighted
      average cost of capital and the control premium. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals
      with specialized skill and knowledge.

      Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
      forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the
      effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessment on goodwill relating to reporting
      units under the Digital media and entertainment segment, including controls relating to fair value determination
      of these reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing the fair values of these reporting
      units as determined by management, which included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation
      methods; (ii) testing the completeness, mathematical accuracy and relevance of the key underlying data
      adopted in the valuation; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions. Evaluating
      management’s assumptions related to the future growth rates, the weighted average cost of capital and
      the control premium involved assessing whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable
      considering (i) the past performance of the reporting unit, and economic and industry forecasts; (ii) the
      weighted average cost of capital of comparable businesses; and (iii) the consistency with external market and
      industry data, and the specific facts and circumstances of the reporting unit, respectively. Professionals with
      specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods,
      and the reasonableness of the future growth rate for terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital and
      the control premium estimated by management.

      Fair Value Determination Related to Investments in Privately Held Companies Accounted for
      Using the Measurement Alternative
      As described in Note 2(t) and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s investments in
      privately held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative were RMB99,270 million as of March
      31, 2022. The Company recorded these investments at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for
      observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same
      issuer. The Company recorded fair value adjustments to a portion of these investments with observable price
      changes during the year ended March 31, 2022. The fair value of these investments is determined based on
      valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs
      including volatility, as well as rights and obligations of the securities.

                        Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value
determination related to investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement
alternative is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment and estimation made by management when
determining the fair value of the investments with observable price changes, which in turn led to a high degree
of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating
to management’s assessment of whether the observable transaction is orderly and whether the investment
involved is identical or similar to the Company’s investment of the same issuer and management’s determination
of the fair value adjustments. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill
and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the
effectiveness of controls relating to fair value determination of the investments in privately held companies
with observable price changes, including controls over management’s assessment of whether the observable
transaction is orderly and whether the investment involved is identical or similar to the Company’s investment
of the same issuer and controls over the determination of the fair value adjustments. These procedures also
included, among others, testing the fair value of these investments as determined by management, which
included (i) evaluating whether the observable transaction is orderly and whether the investment involved is
identical or similar to the Company’s investment of the same issuer, (ii) testing the completeness, mathematical
accuracy and relevance of key underlying data used in the valuation, and (iii) evaluating the unobservable
inputs, including volatility as well as rights and obligations of the securities, as used in the valuation. The
volatility was evaluated by considering the external market and industry data of comparable businesses. The
rights and obligations of the securities were evaluated by reading the investment agreements. Professionals
with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the volatility used
by management as well as the rights and obligations of the securities.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies

           (a) Basis of presentation
                The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
                principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

                Effective on July 30, 2019, the Company subdivided each of its issued and unissued ordinary shares
                into eight ordinary shares (the “Share Subdivision”). Following the Share Subdivision, the Company’s
                authorized share capital became United States Dollar (“US$”) 100,000 divided into 32,000,000,000
                ordinary shares of par value US$0.000003125 per share. The number of issued and unissued ordinary
                shares as disclosed elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements are presented on a basis
                after taking into account the effects of the Share Subdivision and have been retrospectively adjusted,
                where applicable.

                Simultaneously with the Share Subdivision, the change in ratio of the Company’s ADS to ordinary
                share (the “ADS Ratio Change”) also became effective. Following the ADS Ratio Change, each ADS now
                represents eight ordinary shares. Previously, each ADS represented one ordinary share. Given that
                the ADS Ratio Change was exactly proportionate to the Share Subdivision, no new ADSs were issued
                to any ADS holder and the total number of the Company’s outstanding ADSs remains unchanged
                immediately after the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change became effective.

                Translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement,
                consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows from
                RMB into the US$ as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022 are solely for the convenience of the
                readers and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB6.3393, representing the exchange rate set
                forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 31, 2022. No representation
                is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at
                this rate, or at any other rate.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (b) Use of estimates
         The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
         the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
         statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The
         Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
         believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
         carrying values of assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2022, the Company considered the economic
         implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its significant judgments and estimates. Given the impact
         and other unforeseen effects on the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates
         required increased judgment, and actual results could differ from these estimates.

     (c) Consolidation
         The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its
         subsidiaries, which include the PRC-registered entities directly or indirectly owned by the Company
         (“WFOEs”) and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) over which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
         All transactions and balances among the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon
         consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are recorded in the consolidated
         income statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as
         appropriate.

         A subsidiary is an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the
         voting power; or (ii) the Company has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members
         of the board of directors or to cast a majority of votes at the meetings of the board of directors or
         to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee pursuant to a statute or under an
         agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. A VIE is required to be consolidated by the
         primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity holders in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
         controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
         without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

         Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-added
         telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers, the Company
         operates its Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or
         prohibited in the PRC through various contractual arrangements with VIEs that are incorporated and
         owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by PRC citizens. Specifically, these
         representative PRC domestic companies are Zhejiang Taobao Network Co., Ltd., Zhejiang Tmall
         Network Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Alibaba Advertising Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Ali Venture Capital Co., Ltd.,
         Shanghai Rajax Information Technology Co., Ltd., Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd. and Alibaba Culture
         Entertainment Co., Ltd. The registered capital of these PRC domestic companies was funded by the
         Company through loans extended to the equity holders of these PRC domestic companies.

         The Company has entered into certain exclusive technical services agreements with these PRC
         domestic companies, which entitle it to receive a majority of their residual returns and make it
         obligatory for the Company to absorb a majority of the risk of losses from their activities. In addition,
         the Company has entered into certain agreements with the equity holders of these PRC domestic
         companies, including loan agreements that require them to contribute registered capital to those
         PRC domestic companies, exclusive call option agreements to acquire the equity interests in these
         companies when permitted by the PRC laws, rules and regulations, equity pledge agreements of
         the equity interests held by those equity holders, and proxy agreements that irrevocably authorize
         individuals designated by the Company to exercise the equity owner’s rights over these PRC domestic
         companies.



                                                                                       Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report       312

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (c) Consolidation (Continued)
                Details of the typical structure of the Company’s representative VIEs are set forth below:

                (i)   Contracts that give the Company effective control of VIEs
                      Loan agreements
                      Pursuant to the relevant loan agreements, the respective WFOEs have granted loans to the
                      equity holders of the VIEs, which may only be used for the purpose of its business operation
                      activities agreed by the WFOEs or the acquisition of the VIEs. The WFOEs may require acceleration
                      of repayment at their absolute discretion. When the equity holders of the VIEs make early
                      repayment of the outstanding amount, the WFOEs or a third-party designated by the WFOEs
                      may purchase the equity interests in the VIEs at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the
                      loan, subject to any applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. The equity holders of the VIEs
                      undertake not to enter into any prohibited transactions in relation to the VIEs, including the
                      transfer of any business, material assets or equity interests in the VIEs to any third party.

                      Exclusive call option agreements
                      The equity holders of the VIEs have granted the WFOEs exclusive call options to purchase their
                      equity interest in the VIEs at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered
                      capital in the VIEs; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each
                      relevant VIE has further granted the relevant WFOE an exclusive call option to purchase its assets
                      at an exercise price equal to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by
                      applicable PRC laws, whichever is higher. Certain VIEs and their equity holders will also jointly
                      grant the WFOEs (A) exclusive call options to request the VIEs to decrease their registered capital
                      at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the VIEs and (ii)
                      the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws (the “Capital Decrease Price”), and
                      (B) exclusive call options to subscribe for the increased capital of the VIEs at a price equal to
                      the Capital Decrease Price, or the sum of the Capital Decrease Price and the unpaid registered
                      capital, if applicable, as of the capital decrease. The WFOEs may nominate another entity or
                      individual to purchase the equity interest or assets, or to subscribe for the increased capital, if
                      applicable, under the call options. Execution of each call option shall not violate the applicable
                      PRC laws, rules and regulations. Each equity holder of the VIE has agreed that the following
                      amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed to the
                      VIE (after deduction of relevant tax expenses), belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs: (i)
                      proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIE, (ii) proceeds received in connection
                      with a capital decrease in the VIE, and (iii) distributions or liquidation residuals from the
                      disposal of its equity interests in the VIE upon termination or liquidation. Moreover, any profits,
                      distributions or dividends (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) received by the VIEs also
                      belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs. The exclusive call option agreements remain in effect
                      until the equity interest or assets that are the subject of these agreements are transferred to the
                      WFOEs.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         (i)    Contracts that give the Company effective control of VIEs (Continued)
                Proxy agreements
                Pursuant to the relevant proxy agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs irrevocably authorize
                any person designated by the WFOEs to exercise their rights of the equity holders of the VIEs,
                including without limitation the right to vote and appoint directors.

                Equity pledge agreements
                Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs have pledged
                all of their interests in the equity of the VIEs as a continuing first priority security interest in favor
                of the corresponding WFOEs to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant
                loan agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the VIEs
                and/or the equity holders under the other structure contracts. Each WFOE is entitled to exercise
                its right to dispose of the pledged interests in the equity of the VIE held by the equity holders
                and has priority in receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of
                the pledged interests, in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other
                structure contracts, if applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until the later
                of (i) the full performance of the contractual arrangements by the relevant parties, and (ii) the
                full repayment of the loans made to the equity holders of the VIEs.

         (ii)   Contracts that enable the Company to receive substantially all of the economic benefits
                from the VIEs
                Exclusive technology services agreements or exclusive services agreements
                Each relevant VIE has entered into an exclusive technology services agreement or an exclusive
                services agreement with the respective WFOE, pursuant to which the relevant WFOE provides
                exclusive services to the VIE. In exchange, the VIE pays a service fee to the WFOE, the amount of
                which shall be determined, to the extent permitted by applicable PRC laws as proposed by the
                WFOE, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits from the VIE to the WFOE.

                Other arrangements
                The exclusive call option agreements described above also entitle the WFOEs to all profits,
                distributions or dividends (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by the equity
                holder of the VIEs, and the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered
                capital that they contributed to the VIEs (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received
                by each equity holder of the VIEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIEs,
                (ii) proceeds received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIEs, and (iii) distributions
                or liquidation residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIEs upon termination or
                liquidation.

         Based on these contractual agreements, the Company believes that the PRC domestic companies as
         described above should be considered as VIEs because the equity holders do not have significant
         equity at risk nor do they have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Given that the
         Company is the primary beneficiary of these PRC domestic companies, the Company believes that
         these VIEs should be consolidated based on the structure as described above.

                (i) Revenue generated by the VIEs are primarily from cloud services, digital media and entertainment services and others.

                The VIEs did not have any material related party transactions except for the related party transactions
                which are disclosed in Note 22 or elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, and those
                transactions with other subsidiaries that are not VIEs, which were eliminated upon consolidation.

                Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of
                the VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company
                considers that there is no asset in any of the VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the
                VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all VIEs are incorporated as limited
                liability companies under the Company Law of the corresponding jurisdictions, creditors of the VIEs do
                not have recourse to the general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the VIEs.

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         Currently, there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional
         financial support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based on
         the licenses and approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to provide
         financial support to the VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs, as well as the
         Company’s own business objectives in the future.

         Unrecognized revenue-producing assets held by the VIEs include certain Internet content provision
         and other licenses, domain names and trademarks. The Internet content provision and other licenses
         are required under relevant PRC laws, rules and regulations for the operation of Internet businesses
         in the PRC, and therefore are integral to the Company’s operations. The Internet content provision
         licenses require that core PRC trademark registrations and domain names are held by the VIEs that
         provide the relevant services.

     (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests
         The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting
         in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” The cost of an acquisition is measured as the
         aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred to the sellers, liabilities incurred
         by the Company and equity instruments issued by the Company. Transaction costs directly attributable
         to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
         measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any
         noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling
         interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii)
         the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.
         If the cost of acquisition is less than the acquisition date amounts of the net assets of the subsidiary
         acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income statements. During the
         measurement period, which can be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may
         record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to
         goodwill. Subsequent to the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the
         values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any further adjustments are
         recorded in the consolidated income statements.

         In a business combination achieved in stages, the Company re-measures the previously held equity
         interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the
         re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated income statements.

         When there is a change in ownership interests or a change in contractual arrangements that results in
         a loss of control of a subsidiary, the Company deconsolidates the subsidiary from the date control is
         lost. Any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and is
         included in the calculation of the gain or loss upon deconsolidation of the subsidiary.

         For the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to
         reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. When the
         noncontrolling interest is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of a conditional event, which
         is not solely within the control of the Company, the noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine
         equity. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date that it
         becomes probable that the mezzanine equity will become redeemable to the earliest redemption date
         using the effective interest method. Consolidated net income in the consolidated income statements
         includes net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and mezzanine equity holders
         when applicable.



                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report      316

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests (Continued)
                 Net (loss) income attributable to mezzanine equity holders is included in net loss attributable
                 to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated income statements, while it is excluded from the
                 consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity. During the years ended March 31, 2020,
                 2021 and 2022, net (loss) income attributable to mezzanine equity holders amounted to RMB(124)
                 million, RMB140 million and RMB188 million, respectively. The cumulative results of operations
                 attributable to noncontrolling interests, along with adjustments for share-based compensation
                 expense arising from outstanding share-based awards relating to subsidiaries’ shares, are also
                 recorded as noncontrolling interests on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows
                 related to transactions with noncontrolling interests are presented under financing activities in the
                 consolidated statements of cash flows.

           (e) Segment reporting
                 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to
                 the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), which is comprised of certain members of the
                 Company’s management team. Prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company had
                 four operating and reportable segments, namely Core commerce, Cloud computing, Digital media
                 and entertainment, and Innovation initiatives and others segments. Starting from the quarter
                 ended December 31, 2021, the CODM started to review information under a new reporting structure,
                 and segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change, which also provides greater
                 transparency in the Company’s business progress and financial performance. Consequently, the
                 Company presents seven operating and reportable segments as set out in Notes 1 and 26 to reflect
                 the change.

           (f)   Foreign currency translation
                 The functional currency of the Company is US$. The Company’s subsidiaries with operations in
                 mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC (“Hong Kong” or “Hong
                 Kong S.A.R.”), the United States and other jurisdictions generally use their respective local currencies
                 as their functional currencies. When the Company determines that a subsidiary is operating in a highly
                 inflationary economy, the financial statements of this subsidiary shall be remeasured prospectively
                 as if the functional currency were the functional currency of its immediate parent company. The
                 reporting currency of the Company is RMB as the major operations of the Company are within the PRC.
                 The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than the subsidiaries with the functional
                 currency of RMB, are translated into RMB using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date for
                 assets and liabilities and the average daily exchange rate for each month for income and expense
                 items. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss
                 as a component of shareholders’ equity.

                 In the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than the
                 functional currency are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate
                 in effect at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
                 are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
                 currency using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising from foreign
                 currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated income statements during the year in which
                 they occur.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition
         Revenue is principally comprised of customer management services revenue, membership fees,
         logistics services revenue, cloud services revenue, sales of goods and other revenue. Revenue
         represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of promised
         goods or services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities and is recorded net of value-
         added tax (“VAT”). Consistent with the criteria of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”,
         the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control
         of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a
         point in time, the Company also considers the following indicators to assess whether control of
         a promised good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to payment, (ii) legal title, (iii)
         physical possession, (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership and (v) acceptance of the good or
         service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue over time
         by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.

         For revenue arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, each distinct performance
         obligation is separately accounted for and the total consideration is allocated to each performance
         obligation based on the relative standalone selling price at contract inception.

         The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction to determine whether revenue
         should be recorded on a gross or net basis. The Company is acting as the principal if it obtains control
         over the goods and services before they are transferred to customers. Generally, when the Company
         is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, or
         has several but not all of these indicators, the Company acts as the principal and revenue is recorded
         on a gross basis. Generally, when the Company is not primarily obligated in a transaction, does not
         bear the inventory risk and does not have the ability to establish the price, the Company acts as the
         agent and revenue is recorded on a net basis.

         When services are exchanged or swapped for other services, revenue is recognized based on the
         estimated standalone selling price of services promised to customer if the fair value of the services
         received cannot be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized for barter transactions
         was not material for each of the periods presented.

         Practical expedients and exemptions
         The Company applies the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
         obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts for
         which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services
         performed.

         The Company applies the practical expedient to not adjust any of the transaction price for the time
         value of money for contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services
         to the customer and payment by the customer is within one year.




                                                                                     Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report       318

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                Revenue recognition policies by type are as follows:

                (i)   Customer management services revenue
                      Within the Company’s China commerce and International commerce segments, the Company
                      provides the following customer management services to merchants on the Company’s retail
                      and wholesale marketplaces and certain third-party marketing affiliates’ websites:

                      Pay-for-performance (“P4P”) marketing services
                      P4P marketing services allow merchants to bid for keywords that match product or service
                      listings appearing in search results on the Company’s marketplaces. Merchants bid for keywords
                      through an online auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning
                      are determined through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a
                      market-based mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for P4P marketing services and the
                      related revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the
                      point of time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.

                      In-feed marketing services
                      In-feed marketing services allow merchants to bid to market to groups of consumers with similar
                      profiles that match product or service listings appearing in browser results on the Company’s
                      marketplaces. Merchants bid for groups of consumers with similar profiles through an online
                      auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning are determined
                      through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based
                      mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for in-feed marketing services and the related
                      revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the point of
                      time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.

                      Display marketing services
                      Display marketing services allow merchants to place advertisements on the Company’s
                      marketplaces, at fixed prices or prices established by a market-based bidding system and
                      in particular formats. In general, merchants need to prepay for display marketing which is
                      accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized either ratably over the period in
                      which the advertisement is displayed as the merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as
                      the advertisement is displayed or when an advertisement is viewed by users, depending on the
                      type of marketing services selected by the merchants.

                                                            For the Years Ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022




2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         (i)   Customer management services revenue (Continued)
               The Company also places P4P marketing services content and display marketing services
               content through the third-party marketing affiliate program. A substantial portion of customer
               management services revenue generated through the third-party marketing affiliate program
               represented P4P marketing services revenue. In delivery of these customer management
               services, the Company, through the third-party marketing affiliate program, places the P4P
               marketing services content of the participating merchants on third-party online resources in
               the forms of picture or text links through contextual relevance technology to match merchants’
               marketing content to the textual content of the third-party online resources and the users’
               attributes based on the Company’s systems and algorithms. When the links on third-party online
               resources are clicked, users are diverted to a landing page of the Company’s marketplaces
               where listings of the participating merchant as well as similar products or services of other
               merchants are presented. In limited cases, the Company may embed a search box for one of
               its marketplaces on the third-party online resources, and when a keyword is input into the
               search box, the user will be diverted to the Company’s marketplaces where search results are
               presented. Revenue is recognized when the users further click on the P4P marketing content
               on the landing pages. The Company places display marketing content on third-party online
               resources in a similar manner. In general, merchants need to prepay for display marketing which
               is accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized ratably over the period in
               which the advertisement is displayed as merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as the
               advertisement is displayed.

               P4P marketing services revenue, in-feed marketing services revenue, as well as display
               marketing services revenue generated on the Company’s marketplaces or through the third-
               party marketing affiliate program are recorded on a gross basis when the Company is the
               principal to the merchants in the arrangements. For third-party marketing affiliates with whom
               the Company has an arrangement to share the revenue, traffic acquisition cost is also recognized
               at the same time if the P4P marketing content on the landing page clicked by the users is from
               merchants participating in the third-party marketing affiliate program.

               Commissions on transactions
               The Company earns commissions from merchants when transactions are completed on
               Tmall and certain other retail marketplaces of the Company. The commissions are generally
               determined as a percentage based on the value of merchandise being sold by the merchants.
               The commission revenue includes merchant deposits that are expected to be non-refundable
               and is accounted for as variable consideration (Note 2(ac)), which is estimated at contract
               inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes
               available. Revenue related to commissions is recognized in the consolidated income statements
               based on the expected value when the performance obligation is satisfied. Adjustments to the
               estimated variable consideration related to prior reporting periods were not material for each of
               the periods presented.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                (i)    Customer management services revenue (Continued)
                       Taobaoke services
                       In addition, the Company offers the Taobaoke program which generates commissions from
                       merchants for transactions completed by consumers sourced from certain third-party marketing
                       affiliates’ websites and mobile apps. The commission rates on Taobaoke are set by the
                       merchants. The Company’s commission revenue is recognized at the time when the underlying
                       transaction is completed. The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction
                       to determine whether the commission revenue is recognized on a gross or net basis. When
                       the Company is the agent of the arrangement (such as arrangements where the Company
                       does not have latitude in establishing prices or does not have inventory risk), the commission
                       revenue is recorded on a net basis. When the Company is the principal of the arrangement
                       (such as arrangements where the Company is obligated to pay for website inventory costs in
                       fixed amounts to third-party marketing affiliates regardless of whether commission revenue
                       is generated from these marketing affiliates), the commission revenue is recorded on a gross
                       basis.

                (ii)   Membership fees
                       The Company earns membership fees revenue from wholesale sellers in respect of the sale of
                       membership packages and subscriptions that allow them to host premium storefronts on the
                       Company’s wholesale marketplaces, as well as the provision of other value-added services,
                       and from customers in respect of the sale of membership packages which allow them to access
                       premium content on Youku’s paid content platforms. These service fees are paid in advance
                       for a specific contracted service period. All these fees are initially deferred as deferred revenue
                       and customer advances when received and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
                       respective service contracts as the services are provided.

                (iii) Logistics services revenue
                       The Company earns logistics services revenue from domestic and international one-stop-shop
                       logistics services and the supply chain management solutions provided by Cainiao Network and
                       Lazada as well as on-demand delivery services provided by Ele.me. Revenue is recognized at
                       the time when the logistics services are provided.

                (iv) Cloud services revenue
                       The Company earns cloud services revenue from the provision of cloud services such as
                       proprietary servers, elastic computing, storage, network, security, database and big data, and
                       IoT services. Certain cloud services allow customers to use hosted software over the contract
                       period without taking possession of the software. These cloud services are mainly charged
                       on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services charged on
                       a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud
                       services charged on a consumption basis, such as the quantity of storage or elastic computing
                       services used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of the resources.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
           (iv) Cloud services revenue (Continued)
                 For the provision of hybrid cloud services, which include hardware, software licenses, software
                 installation services, application development and maintenance services, each distinct
                 performance obligation identified is separately accounted for and the total consideration is
                 allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices at
                 contract inception. Revenue for each performance obligation is recognized when the control of
                 the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer.

           (v)   Sales of goods
                 Revenue from the sales of goods is mainly generated from Sun Art, Tmall Supermarket and
                 Freshippo. Revenue from the sales of goods is recognized when the control over the promised
                 goods is transferred to customers. Receipts of fees in respect of all other incidental goods or
                 services provided by the Company that are distinct performance obligations are recognized
                 when the control of the underlying goods or services is transferred to the customers. The
                 amounts relating to these incidental services are not material to the Company’s total revenue for
                 each of the periods presented.

     (h) Cost of revenue
           Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of inventories, logistics costs, expenses associated with the
           operation of the Company’s mobile platforms and websites (such as depreciation and maintenance
           expenses for servers and computers, call centers and other equipment, and bandwidth and co-
           location fees), staff costs and share-based compensation expense, traffic acquisition costs, content
           costs, payment processing fees and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to
           the Company’s principal operations.

     (i)   Product development expenses
           Product development expenses consist primarily of staff costs and share-based compensation
           expense for research and development personnel and other expenses that are directly attributable to
           the development of new technologies and products for the businesses of the Company, such as the
           development of the Internet infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and
           networks.

           The Company expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and implementation
           phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance of the existing
           websites or the development of software and website content. Costs incurred in the development
           phase are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life. However, as the amount of costs
           qualified for capitalization has been insignificant, all website and software development costs have
           been expensed as incurred.

     (j)   Sales and marketing expenses
           Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising expenses, promotion
           expenses, staff costs and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions and other related
           incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers and merchants.

           The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and
           expenses the costs of delivering advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or airtime
           is used. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled RMB30,949 million, RMB57,073 million and
           RMB91,103 million during the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.


                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report    322

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (k) Share-based compensation
                 Share-based awards granted are measured at fair value on grant date and share-based
                 compensation expense is recognized (i) immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are
                 required, or (ii) using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
                 requisite service period. The fair values of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares are
                 determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying shares and the fair value of share
                 options is generally determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The value is recognized
                 as an expense over the respective service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Share-based
                 compensation expense, when recognized, is charged to the consolidated income statements with the
                 corresponding entry to additional paid-in capital, liability or noncontrolling interests as disclosed in
                 Note 2(d).

                 On each measurement date, the Company reviews internal and external sources of information to
                 assist in the estimation of various attributes to determine the fair value of the share-based awards,
                 including the fair value of the underlying shares, expected life and expected volatility. The Company
                 recognizes the impact of any revisions to the original forfeiture rate assumptions in the consolidated
                 income statements, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

           (l)   Other employee benefits
                 The Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer
                 defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits
                 are provided to employees. The relevant labor regulations require the Company’s subsidiaries in
                 the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions based on the
                 applicable benchmarks and rates stipulated by the local government. The relevant local labor and
                 social welfare authorities are responsible for meeting all retirement benefits obligations and the
                 Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC have no further commitments beyond their monthly contributions.
                 The contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred. The Company also makes payments to other
                 defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for the benefit of employees employed by
                 subsidiaries outside of the PRC.

                 During the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, contributions to the plans amounting to
                 RMB6,705 million, RMB8,223 million and RMB13,086 million, respectively, were charged to the
                 consolidated income statements. Amounts contributed to defined benefit plans during the years
                 ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were insignificant.

           (m) Income taxes
                 The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income tax
                 is recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
                 carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
                 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
                 in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
                 tax of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
                 enactment date. Valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more
                 likely than not that the asset will not be realizable in the foreseeable future.

                 Deferred tax is recognized on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, which are presumed to be
                 distributed to parent companies, unless there is sufficient evidence that the subsidiaries have invested
                 or will invest the undistributed earnings permanently in the domestic jurisdictions or the earnings
                 will not be subject to tax upon the subsidiaries’ liquidation. Deferred tax is recognized for temporary
                 differences in relation to certain investments in equity method investees, equity securities and other
                 investments.

                                                             For the Years Ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022




2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (m) Income taxes (Continued)
         The Company adopts ASC 740 “Income Taxes” which prescribes a more likely than not threshold
         for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
         taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
         classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and
         penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income
         tax disclosures. The Company did not have significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any
         unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of and for
         the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

         In April 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the
         Accounting for Income Taxes”. ASU 2019-12 simplifies various aspects related to accounting for
         income taxes, removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and
         amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not
         have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     (n) Government grants
         Government grants, which mainly represent amounts received from central and local governments in
         connection with the Company’s investments in local business districts and contributions to technology
         development, are recognized as income in other income, net or as a reduction of specific costs and
         expenses for which the grants are intended to compensate. Such amounts are recognized in the
         consolidated income statements upon receipt and when all conditions attached to the grants are
         fulfilled.

     (o) Leases
         The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases that transfer substantially
         all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases
         as if there was an acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease.
         All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. The Company has no significant finance leases.

         The Company recognizes lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance
         sheet for leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in non-current prepayments,
         receivables and other assets (Note 13), and operating lease liabilities are included in current accrued
         expenses, accounts payable and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities (Note 19) on the
         consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are
         initially recognized based on the present value of future lease payments at lease commencement.
         The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease
         commencement and the initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and is recorded net of any lease
         incentives received. As the interest rates implicit in most of the leases are not readily determinable,
         the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at lease
         commencement to determine the present value of the future lease payments. Operating lease
         expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

         The Company elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for leases of certain asset
         classes such as shops and malls and equipment leases. Lease and non-lease components for leases
         of other asset classes are accounted for separately. The Company also elected not to recognize short-
         term leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report     324

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (p) Cash and cash equivalents
                The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
                months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily
                represent bank deposits and fixed deposits with original maturities of less than three months.

           (q) Short-term investments
                Short-term investments consist primarily of investments in fixed deposits with original maturities
                between three months and one year and certain investments in wealth management products,
                marketable debt securities and other investments that the Company has the intention to redeem
                within one year.

           (r) Accounts receivable
                Accounts receivable represent the amounts that the Company has an unconditional right to
                consideration. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
                uncollectible receivable amounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts were RMB3,977 million and
                RMB4,912 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In April 2020, the Company adopted
                ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement on Credit Losses on
                Financial Instruments”, including certain subsequent amendments, transitional guidance and other
                interpretive guidance within ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and
                ASU 2020-03 (collectively, including ASU 2016-13, “ASC 326”). ASC 326 introduces an approach based
                on expected losses to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts, which replaces the previous
                incurred loss impairment model. The Company’s estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts
                considers factors such as historical credit loss experience, age of receivable balances, current market
                conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as an
                assessment of receivables due from specific identifiable counterparties to determine whether these
                receivables are considered at risk or uncollectible. The Company assesses collectibility by pooling
                receivables that have similar risk characteristics and evaluates receivables individually when specific
                receivables no longer share those risk characteristics. For receivables evaluated individually, when it
                is determined that foreclosure is probable or when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty at the
                reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale
                of collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date,
                adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. The adoption of ASC 326 did not have a material impact on
                the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The consolidated financial
                statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 were not retrospectively adjusted.

           (s) Inventories
                Inventories mainly consist of merchandise available for sale. They are accounted for using the
                weighted average cost method and stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
                value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
                completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

     (t)   Equity securities and other investments
           Equity securities and other investments represent the Company’s investments in equity securities that
           are not accounted for under the equity method, as well as other investments which primarily consist
           of debt investments.

           (i)    Equity securities
                  Equity securities not accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with
                  unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements, according to ASC
                  321 “Investments – Equity Securities”.

                  The Company elected to record a majority of equity investments in privately held companies
                  using the measurement alternative at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for
                  observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments
                  of the same issuer.

                  Equity investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative
                  are subject to periodic impairment reviews. The Company’s impairment analysis considers both
                  qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the fair value of these
                  equity securities, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-
                  Ukraine conflict.

                  In computing realized gains and losses on equity securities, the Company determines cost based
                  on amounts paid using the average cost method. Dividend income is recognized when the right
                  to receive the payment is established.

           (ii)   Debt investments
                  Debt investments are accounted for at amortized cost or under the fair value option, which
                  the Company has elected for certain investments including convertible and exchangeable
                  bonds subscribed. The fair value option permits the irrevocable election on an instrument-
                  by-instrument basis at initial recognition or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of
                  accounting for that instrument. The investments accounted for under the fair value option are
                  carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income
                  statements. Interest income from debt investments is recognized using the effective interest
                  method which is reviewed and adjusted periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows.

     (u) Investments in equity method investees
           The Company applies the equity method to account for equity investments in common stock or in-
           substance common stock, according to ASC 323 “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures”,
           over which it has significant influence but does not own a controlling financial interest, unless the fair
           value option is elected for an investment.

           An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward
           characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity’s common stock. The Company considers
           subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining
           whether an investment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity’s common
           stock.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (u) Investments in equity method investees (Continued)
                Under the equity method, the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the equity
                method investee is recognized in the consolidated income statements and its share of post-acquisition
                movements in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive
                income. The Company records its share of the results of the equity method investees on a one quarter
                in arrears basis. The excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the underlying equity in net
                assets of the equity method investee generally represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired.
                When the Company’s share of losses of the equity method investee equals or exceeds its interest in
                the equity method investee, the Company does not recognize further losses, unless the Company has
                incurred obligations or made payments or guarantees on behalf of the equity method investee.

                The Company continually reviews its investments in equity method investees to determine whether
                a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The primary factors the
                Company considers in its determination include the severity and the length of time that the fair value
                of the investment is below its carrying value; the financial condition, the operating performance and
                the prospects of the equity method investee; the geographic region, market and industry in which the
                equity method investee operates, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
                and Russia-Ukraine conflict; and other company specific information such as recent financing rounds
                completed by the equity method investee. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-
                temporary, the carrying value of the investment in the equity method investee is written down to its
                fair value.

           (v) Property and equipment, net
                Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
                loss. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with no residual value based on the
                estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range as follows:

                Computer equipment and software                      3 – 5 years
                Furniture, office and transportation
                  equipment and others                               3 – 10 years
                Buildings and other property                         10 – 50 years
                Property improvements                                shorter of remaining lease period or estimated
                                                                     useful life

                Construction in progress represents buildings and related premises under construction, which is
                stated at actual construction cost less any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to
                the respective category of property and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use.

                Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and asset improvements are capitalized.
                The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of or retired are removed from the
                accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated income statements.

     (w) Intangible assets other than licensed copyrights
         Intangible assets mainly include those acquired through business combinations and purchased
         intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recognized as
         assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion.
         Intangible assets arising from business combinations are measured at fair value upon acquisition
         using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and ratio analysis with reference to
         comparable companies in similar industries under the income approach, market approach and cost
         approach. Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangible assets include
         future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Purchased intangible assets are initially
         recognized and measured at cost upon acquisition. Separately identifiable intangible assets that have
         determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line
         method as follows:

         User base and customer relationships                 3 – 16 years
         Trade names, trademarks and domain names             5 – 20 years
         Developed technology and patents                     2 – 7 years
         Non-compete agreements                               over the contracted term of up to 10 years


     (x) Licensed copyrights
         Licensed copyrights related to titles to movies, television series, variety shows, animations and other
         video content acquired from external parties are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or fair
         value. The amortization period for the licensed content vary depending on the type of content, which
         typically ranges from six months to ten years. Licensed copyrights are presented on the consolidated
         balance sheets as current assets under prepayments, receivables and other assets, or non-current
         assets under intangible assets, net, based on estimated time of usage. Licensed copyrights are
         generally amortized using an accelerated method based on historical viewership consumption
         patterns. Estimates of the consumption patterns for licensed copyrights are reviewed periodically and
         revised if necessary. For the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, amortization expenses in
         connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB9,390 million, RMB9,093 million and RMB8,610 million
         were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s Digital media and entertainment segment.

         On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates the program usefulness of licensed copyrights pursuant
         to the guidance in ASC 920 “Entertainment – Broadcasters”, which provides that the rights be reported
         at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. When there is a change in the expected usage of
         licensed copyrights, the Company estimates the fair value of licensed copyrights to determine if any
         impairment exists. The fair value of licensed copyrights is determined by estimating the expected
         cash flows from advertising and membership fees, less any costs and expenses, over the remaining
         useful lives of the licensed copyrights at the film-group level. Estimates that impact these cash flows
         include anticipated levels of demand for the Company’s advertising services and the expected selling
         prices of advertisements. For the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, impairment charges in
         connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB2,654 million, RMB1,688 million and RMB745 million
         were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s Digital media and entertainment segment.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report     328

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (x) Licensed copyrights (Continued)
                In April 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2019-02, “Entertainment — Films — Other Assets — Film Costs
                (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment — Broadcasters — Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Subtopic
                920-350)”. As a result of the adoption of this new accounting update, cash outflows for the acquisition
                of licensed copyrights amounting to RMB11,811 million and RMB10,096 million are classified as
                operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2021
                and 2022, respectively. Comparative figure was not retrospectively adjusted and were classified as
                investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2020.
                The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and
                results of operations.

           (y) Goodwill
                Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition date amounts of
                the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired
                entity as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries. Goodwill is not
                amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
                in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company
                may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative
                goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers factors such as
                macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the
                reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations, business plans and strategies
                of the reporting unit, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the
                qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the
                carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. The Company may also bypass the
                qualitative assessment and proceed directly to perform the quantitative impairment test.

                In April 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):
                Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”. After adopting this guidance, the Company performs
                the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
                amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
                goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
                value, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value is recognized
                as impairment. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment,
                including the identification of reporting units, allocation of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting
                units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.

           (z) Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and licensed copyrights
                The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
                indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
                be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future
                undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the assets are considered to
                be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of
                the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill
                and licensed copyrights recognized for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 was RMB874
                million, nil and RMB973 million, respectively.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (aa) Derivatives and hedging
         All contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are recognized on the consolidated balance
         sheets as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
         are either recognized periodically in the consolidated income statements or in other comprehensive
         income depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting and
         are so designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.

         To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented
         at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which
         includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge
         effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be effective in accomplishing the objective of
         offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of
         the hedging relationship is evaluated on a prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and
         quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of
         the derivative to those of the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the changes
         in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to that of the hedged item. A
         hedging relationship is considered initially effective if the results of the hedging instrument are within
         a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.

         Interest rate swaps
         Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the cash flows attributable
         to recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted payments may qualify as cash flow hedges. The
         Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap floating interest payments related to
         certain borrowings for fixed interest payments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain
         forecasted payments and obligations. All changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are
         designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
         income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the
         same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

         The Company has elected the optional expedients under ASC 848 “Reference Rate Reform” for certain
         existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges in the hedging relationship
         designation and the assessment of probability of forecasted transaction and hedge effectiveness.

     (ab) Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes
         Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes are recognized initially at fair value, net of upfront
         fees, debt discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees. Upfront fees, debt
         discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees are recorded as a reduction of
         the proceeds received and the related accretion is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated
         income statements over the estimated term of the facilities using the effective interest method.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report     330

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (ac) Merchant deposits
                The Company collects deposits representing an annual upfront service fee from merchants on Tmall
                and AliExpress before the beginning of each calendar year. These deposits are initially recorded as
                a liability by the Company. The deposits are refundable to a merchant if the level of sales volume
                that is generated by that merchant on Tmall or AliExpress meets the target during the period. If the
                transaction volume target is not met at the end of each calendar year, the relevant deposits will
                become non-refundable. These merchant deposits are accounted for as variable consideration at an
                amount that is estimated at contract inception. The estimate is updated at the end of each reporting
                period and when there are changes in circumstances during the reporting period. Merchant deposits
                are recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statements when the likelihood of refund to
                the merchant is considered remote based on the patterns of sales volume generated by the merchant
                during the reporting period.

           (ad) Deferred revenue and customer advances
                Deferred revenue and customer advances generally represent cash received from customers
                that relate to goods or services to be provided in the future. Deferred revenue, mainly relating to
                membership fees and cloud services revenue, is stated at the amount of service fees received less the
                amount previously recognized as revenue upon the provision of the respective services to customers.

           (ae) Commitments and contingencies
                In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings
                and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for the
                contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
                the liability can be reasonably estimated.

                Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which
                may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events
                occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses these contingent liabilities, which inherently involves
                judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the
                Company or unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, the Company, in consultation
                with its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims
                as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If
                the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred
                and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the
                consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
                contingency is not probable, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent
                liability, together with an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible loss, if determinable and
                material, would be disclosed.

                Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in
                which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (af) Treasury shares
          The Company accounts for treasury shares using the cost method. Under this method, the cost
          incurred to purchase the shares is recorded in the treasury shares account on the consolidated
          balance sheets. At retirement of the treasury shares, the ordinary shares account is charged only
          for the aggregate par value of the shares. The excess of the acquisition cost of treasury shares over
          the aggregate par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The
          treasury shares account includes 143,363,408 ordinary shares and nil ordinary shares issued at par
          to wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company for the purpose of certain equity investment plans for
          management as of March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

     (ag) Statutory reserves
          In accordance with the relevant regulations and their articles of association, subsidiaries of the
          Company incorporated in the PRC are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profit
          determined based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations to the general reserve until
          the reserve has reached 50% of the relevant subsidiary’s registered capital. Appropriations to the
          enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the respective
          board of directors of the subsidiaries. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are
          not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. During the years
          ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, appropriations to the general reserve amounted to RMB1,032
          million, RMB1,247 million and RMB2,492 million, respectively. No appropriations to the enterprise
          expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund have been made by the Company.

     (ah) Newly adopted accounting standard updates
          In April 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2020-01, “Investments — Equity Securities (Topic 321),
          Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)
          — Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a consensus of the FASB
          Emerging Issues Task Force)”, which clarifies the interactions of the accounting for certain equity
          securities under ASC 321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC
          323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under
          ASC 815. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively and the adoption of this guidance did not
          have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

3.   Recent accounting pronouncements
     In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects
     of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and issued a subsequent amendment which refines the
     scope of the ASU and clarifies some of its guidance as part of the FASB’s monitoring of global reference
     rate reform activities in January 2021 within ASU 2021-01 (collectively, including ASU 2020-04, “ASC 848”).
     ASC 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP on contract modifications
     and hedge accounting to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or
     another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are
     met. These optional expedients and exceptions provided in ASC 848 are effective for the Company from
     January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company has elected the optional expedients for certain
     existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, which did not have a material impact
     on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company is evaluating the effects, if
     any, of the potential election of the other optional expedients and exceptions provided in this guidance on
     the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report    332

      For the Years Ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022




      3.   Recent accounting pronouncements (Continued)
           In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
           470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for
           Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies an issuer’s accounting
           for certain convertible instruments and the application of derivatives scope exception for contracts in an
           entity’s own equity. This guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the
           diluted earnings per share calculation and required enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible
           instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new guidance is required to be applied either
           retrospectively to financial instruments outstanding as of the beginning of the first comparable reporting
           period for each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change
           to be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption.
           This guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2023 and interim reporting
           periods during the year ending March 31, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect
           the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations
           and cash flows.

           In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract
           Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”, which provides guidance on the acquirer’s
           accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The amendments
           require an acquirer recognizes and measures contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business
           combination at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated the contracts.
           This guidance also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring
           acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. The new
           guidance is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the date
           of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2024 and interim
           reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does
           not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial position, results
           of operations and cash flows.

           In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by
           Business Entities about Government Assistance”, which provides guidance on the disclosure of transactions
           with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by
           analogy. The new guidance is required to be applied either prospectively to all transactions within
           the scope of ASU 2021-10 that are reflected in financial statements at the date of adoption and new
           transactions that are entered into after the date of adoption or retrospectively to those transactions. This
           guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The
           Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial
           position, results of operations and cash flows.

           In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement
           of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”, which clarifies that a contractual restriction
           on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and,
           therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot,
           as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also
           requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance
           is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments
           recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company
           for the year ending March 31, 2025 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2025.
           Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a
           material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

4.   Significant mergers and acquisitions and investments

     Mergers and acquisitions
     (a)   Acquisition of Sun Art Retail Group Limited (“Sun Art”)
           Sun Art, a company that is listed on the HKSE, is a leading hypermarket operator in the PRC. The
           Company previously held an approximately 31% effective equity interest in Sun Art and the investment
           in Sun Art was previously accounted for under the equity method. New Retail Strategic Opportunities
           Fund, L.P. (the “Offshore Retail Fund”), an investment fund for which the Company is able to exercise
           significant influence over its investment decisions, is also an existing shareholder in Sun Art.

           In October 2020, the Company acquired additional effective equity interest in Sun Art for a cash
           consideration of US$3.6 billion (RMB24.1 billion). Upon the completion of the transaction, the
           Company’s effective equity interest in Sun Art increased to approximately 67% and Sun Art became a
           consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

           The allocation of the purchase price as of the date of acquisition is summarized as follows:

                                                                                                                            Amounts

            Total purchase price is comprised of:
            - cash consideration                                                                                               24,136

           (i) Net assets acquired primarily included property and equipment of RMB27,333 million, operating lease right-of-

      4.   Significant mergers and acquisitions and investments (Continued)

           Mergers and acquisitions (Continued)
           (a)   Acquisition of Sun Art Retail Group Limited (“Sun Art”) (Continued)
                 A gain of RMB6,381 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
                 recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
                 ended March 31, 2021. The fair value of the previously held equity interests was estimated with
                 reference to the market price per share as of the acquisition date.

                 As reported in Sun Art’s 2020/2021 annual report, revenue and net income for the 15 months ended
                 March 31, 2021 were RMB124.3 billion and RMB3.8 billion, respectively. Revenue and net income for
                 the year ended December 2019 were RMB95.4 billion and RMB3.0 billion, respectively.

                 The acquisition of Sun Art demonstrates the Company’s continued commitment to Sun Art as well as to
                 further update its digital commerce infrastructure by further integrating online and offline resources
                 in the PRC’s retail sector. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies
                 expected from the combined operations of Sun Art and the Company, the assembled workforce
                 and their knowledge and experience in the retail sector in the PRC. The Company did not expect the
                 goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

                 In December 2020, the Company acquired additional ordinary shares of Sun Art from public
                 shareholders for a cash consideration of HK$4.9 billion (RMB4.1 billion) through a mandatory general
                 offer as required under the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which resulted in a reduction
                 in noncontrolling interests amounting to RMB4,592 million. Upon the completion of the mandatory
                 general offer, the Company’s effective equity interest in Sun Art further increased to approximately
                 74%.

           (b) Acquisition of HQG, Inc. (“Koala”)
                 Koala is an import e-commerce platform in the PRC. In September 2019, the Company acquired a
                 100% equity interest in Koala from NetEase, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of US$1,874 million
                 (RMB13,326 million), comprising cash and approximately 14.3 million newly issued ordinary shares
                 (equivalent to approximately 1.8 million ADSs) of the Company valued at US$316 million (RMB2,252
                 million).

                 The allocation of the purchase price as of the date of acquisition is summarized as follows:

                                                                                                                Amounts
                                                                                                    (in millions of RMB)

            Total purchase price is comprised of:
            – cash consideration                                                                                              10,025

           (i) Net assets acquired primarily included inventories of RMB1,943 million as of the date of acquisition.
           (ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets had estimated amortization periods not exceeding 13 years and a weighted-
                average amortization period of 8.5 years.
           (iii) Contingent consideration primarily includes cash consideration that is contingently payable upon the satisfaction of
                 certain non-compete provisions by the selling equity holders, and will not exceed RMB846 million.

           The Company expected that the acquisition will further elevate the Company’s import service and
           experience for consumers in the PRC through synergies across the Company’s ecosystem. Goodwill
           arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the combined operations
           of Koala and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in the
           import e-commerce sector in the PRC. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be
           deductible for income tax purposes.

                 Company MegaFon (“MegaFon”, a Russian mobile telecommunications operator) and Joint Stock
                 Company “Managing Company of Russian Direct Investment Fund” (“RDIF”, a Russian sovereign
                 wealth fund). In October 2019, the Company invested approximately US$100 million into the joint
                 venture and contributed the Company’s AliExpress Russia businesses into the joint venture. The other

                 the transaction, the Company has also acquired a minority stake in VK.

                 The contribution of the Company’s AliExpress Russia businesses into the joint venture resulted in
                 the deconsolidation of these businesses, and a one-time gain of RMB10.3 billion was recognized in
                 interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year ended March
                 31, 2020.

                 The investment in the AliExpress Russia Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method (Note

                 RMB4,290 million was allocated to goodwill, RMB116 million was allocated to deferred tax liabilities
                 and RMB1,630 million was allocated to net assets acquired.

                 shareholder of the joint venture, allowing the transfer of equity interest in the joint venture between
                 the Company and this shareholder in the future. In December 2020, this shareholder exercised a
                 call option under this agreement to acquire additional equity interest in the AliExpress Russia Joint
                 Venture from the Company for a cash consideration of US$194 million (RMB1,269 million). Upon the
                 completion of this transaction, the Company’s equity interest in the AliExpress Russia Joint Venture

     Equity investments and others (Continued)
     (k)   Investment in Ant Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”) (Continued)
           In February 2018, the Company amended both the SAPA and the Alipay commercial agreement,
           and agreed with Ant Group and certain other parties on forms of certain ancillary agreements. In
           September 2019, the Company further amended the SAPA and entered into a cross license agreement
           and certain ancillary agreements and amendments, including the previously agreed form of
           amendment and restatement of the 2014 IPLA (“the Amended IPLA”). In August 2020, the Company
           further amended the SAPA, the Alipay commercial agreement and certain other agreements. In July
           2022, the Company and Ant Group further amended the SAPA and the Alipay commercial agreement.

           SAPA
           Issuance of equity interest
           In September 2019, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions, the Company received the 33%
           equity interest in Ant Group pursuant to the SAPA, as amended in 2018 and 2019.

           Under the SAPA, as amended in 2018 and 2019, the consideration to acquire the newly issued 33%
           equity interest in Ant Group was fully funded by concurrent payments from Ant Group to the Company
           in consideration for certain intellectual property rights and assets that the Company transferred to Ant
           Group upon the issuance of the equity interest. Such consideration was determined based on the fair
           values of the underlying assets exchanged in the transaction as described above at contract inception
           in 2014, whereby the fair value of the intellectual property rights and assets approximated the fair
           value of the equity interest at the time.

           The Company accounts for its equity interest in Ant Group under the equity method. Upon the receipt
           of the equity interest in September 2019, this investment was initially measured at cost, with an
           upward adjustment determined based on the fair value of the Company’s share of Ant Group’s net
           assets as of the completion date of the transaction.

           Upon the completion, the Company recorded the 33% equity interest in Ant Group with a carrying value
           amounting to RMB90.7 billion in investments in equity method investees, other cost reimbursement of
           RMB0.6 billion from Ant Group to the Company pursuant to the SAPA, as amended in 2018 and 2019,
           and the deferred tax effect of RMB19.7 billion, with a corresponding gain of RMB71.6 billion recorded
           in interest and investment income, net in the year ended March 31, 2020. The difference between the
           carrying value of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the Company’s share of the carrying value
           of Ant Group’s net assets upon completion is a basis difference, which mainly represents the fair
           value adjustments of amortizable intangible assets with a weighted average amortization period of
           9.5 years and equity investments. These adjustments amounted to RMB24.5 billion and RMB5.3 billion,
           respectively, both of which were net of their corresponding tax effects.

           The application of accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in
           Ant Group and the recognition of the upward adjustment require significant management judgment,
           which included (i) determination of the contract inception date of the SAPA for the initial measurement
           of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and (ii) determination of the accounting treatment for the
           difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the
           cost of investment when the former is greater than the latter.

           In relation to the determination of the contract inception date of the SAPA, management considered
           the relevant U.S. GAAP guidance and focused on the legal enforceability of the agreement, and
           determined that the contract inception date was in 2014.

                 Issuance of equity interest (Continued)
                 In relation to the determination of the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company’s
                 share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the cost of investment when the former
                 is greater than the latter, in the absence of specific guidance and with the diversity in practice,
                 management assessed various views derived from the interpretations of relevant U.S. GAAP and
                 made reference to the relevant guidance of other international accounting framework and recognized
                 the difference under interest and investment income, net with a corresponding increase to the initial
                 carrying value of the investment in Ant Group.

                 Subsequent to the receipt of the equity interest in Ant Group, the proportionate share of results of
                 Ant Group, adjusted for the effects of the basis difference as described above, is recorded in share of
                 results of equity method investees in the consolidated income statements on a one quarter in arrears
                 basis.

                 Pre-emptive rights
                 Following the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group, the Company has pre-emptive rights to
                 participate in other issuances of equity securities by Ant Group and certain of its affiliates prior to
                 the time of Ant Group meeting certain minimum criteria for a qualified IPO set forth in the SAPA (as
                 amended) (a “Qualified IPO”). These pre-emptive rights entitle the Company to maintain the equity
                 ownership percentage the Company holds in Ant Group immediately prior to any such issuances. In
                 connection with the exercise of the pre-emptive rights, the Company is also entitled to receive certain
                 payments from Ant Group, effectively funding the subscription for these additional equity interest, up
                 to a value of US$1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, under the SAPA (as amended),
                 in certain circumstances the Company is permitted to exercise pre-emptive rights through an
                 alternative arrangement which will further protect the Company from dilution. The value of the pre-
                 emptive rights was considered to be insignificant upon the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group.

                 Corporate governance provisions
                 Under the SAPA (as amended), in addition to jointly recommending an independent director together
                 with Ant Group (who will be subject to vetting requirements as set forth in the SAPA (as amended)),
                 the Company has the right to nominate two officers or employees of the Company for election to
                 the board of Ant Group. In each case, these director nomination rights will continue unless the
                 Company ceases to own a certain amount of its post-issuance equity interest in Ant Group or upon
                 the completion of a Qualified IPO of Ant Group, whichever is earlier. In September 2019, the Company
                 nominated two officers of the Company who have then been elected to the board of Ant Group
                 pursuant to these director nomination rights under the SAPA (as amended).

           2014 IPLA
           Under the 2014 IPLA, the Company received, in addition to a software technology service fee, royalty
           streams related to Alipay and other current and future businesses of Ant Group (collectively, the “Profit
           Share Payments”). The Profit Share Payments were paid at least annually and equaled the sum of
           an expense reimbursement plus 37.5% of the consolidated pre-tax income of Ant Group, subject to
           certain adjustments. The expense reimbursement represented the reimbursement for the costs and
           expenses incurred by the Company in the provision of software technology services. The Company
           accounted for the Profit Share Payments in the periods when the services were provided, where the
           payments were expected to approximate the estimated fair values of the services provided. Upon the
           receipt of the equity interest in September 2019, the Company terminated the 2014 IPLA, and the Profit
           Share Payments arrangement was terminated.

           Income in connection with the Profit Share Payments, net of costs incurred by the Company, of
           RMB3,835 million, was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated income statements for the
           year ended March 31, 2020 (Note 22).

           Amended IPLA
           Pursuant to the SAPA, as amended in 2018 and 2019, the Company, Ant Group and Alipay entered
           into the Amended IPLA upon the receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group in September 2019, at
           which time the Company also transferred certain intellectual property and assets to Ant Group.

           The Amended IPLA will terminate upon the earliest of:

           •    the full payment of all pre-emptive rights funded payments under the SAPA (as amended);

           •    the closing of a Qualified IPO of Ant Group or Alipay; and

           •    the transfer to Ant Group of any remaining intellectual property the Company owns that is
                exclusively related to the business of Ant Group.

     (l)   Investment in Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Limited (“Red Star”)
           Red Star, a company that is listed on both the HKSE and Shanghai Stock Exchange, is a leading
           home improvement and furnishings shopping mall operator in the PRC. In May 2019, the Company
           completed the subscription of exchangeable bonds issued by the controlling shareholder of Red Star
           for a cash consideration of RMB4,359 million. The exchangeable bonds have a term of five years and
           are exchangeable into ordinary shares of Red Star at an initial price of RMB12.28 per share, subject to
           adjustments if there are corporate events such as distribution of stock dividends, new shares issuance
           and rights issue. The exchangeable bonds are accounted for under the fair value option and recorded
           under equity securities and other investments. In addition, the Company acquired an approximately
           2% equity interest in Red Star for a total consideration of HK$447 million (RMB390 million). The
           equity interest in Red Star is carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the
           consolidated income statements. The Offshore Retail Fund is also an investor in this transaction.

           In September 2021, the Company disposed of certain portion of the exchangeable bonds issued by the
           controlling shareholder of Red Star. In October 2021, the Company acquired additional equity interest
           in Red Star for a cash consideration of RMB350 million. Upon the completion of the transaction, the

6.   Leases
     The Company entered into operating lease agreements primarily for shops and malls, offices, warehouses
     and land. Certain lease agreements contain an option for the Company to renew a lease for a term of up to
     five years or an option to terminate a lease early. The Company considers these options in determining the
     classification and measurement of the leases.

     The leases may include variable payments based on measures such as the level of sales at a physical store,
     which are expensed as incurred.

     Components of operating lease cost are as follows:

                                                                                           Year ended March 31,

           Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital
           gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands
           withholding tax is imposed. The Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to the
           Hong Kong profits tax rate at 16.5% for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The Company’s
           subsidiaries incorporated in other jurisdictions were subject to income tax charges calculated according to
           the tax laws enacted or substantially enacted in the countries where they operate and generate income.

           Current income tax expense primarily includes the provision for PRC Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) for
           subsidiaries operating in the PRC and withholding tax on earnings that have been declared for distribution
           by PRC subsidiaries to offshore holding companies. Substantially all of the Company’s income before
           income tax and share of results of equity method investees are generated by these PRC subsidiaries. These
           subsidiaries are subject to EIT on their taxable income as reported in their respective statutory financial
           statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and regulations in the PRC.

7.   Income tax expenses (Continued)

     Composition of income tax expenses (Continued)
     Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for
     domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for,
     among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology
     Enterprises. Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as Software Enterprises and thereby entitled
     to full exemption from EIT for two years beginning from their first profitable calendar year and a 50%
     reduction for the subsequent three calendar years. In addition, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise
     (“KSE”) within China’s national plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The KSE status is subject to
     review by the relevant authorities every year and the timing of the annual review and notification by the
     relevant authorities may vary from year to year. The related reduction in tax expense as a result of official
     notification confirming the KSE status is accounted for upon the receipt of such notification.

     The tax status of the subsidiaries of the Company with major taxable profits is described below:

     •    Alibaba (China) Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alibaba China”), Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd. (“Taobao
          China”), Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tmall China”) and Alibaba (China) Co., Ltd (“China
          Co.”), entities primarily engaged in the operations of the Company’s wholesale marketplaces, Taobao,
          Tmall, and technology, software research and development and relevant services, respectively, were
          qualified as High and New Technology Enterprises. Alibaba China, Taobao China and Tmall China
          also obtained the annual review and notification relating to the renewal of the KSE status for the
          taxation years of 2018 and 2019 in the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
          Accordingly, Alibaba China, Taobao China and Tmall China, which had applied an EIT rate of 15% for
          the taxation years of 2018 and 2019, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation years of
          2018 and 2019 in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021.

     •    Alibaba (Beijing) Software Services Co., Ltd (“Alibaba Beijing”), an entity primarily engaged in the
          operations of technology, software research and development and relevant services, was recognized
          as a High and New Technology Enterprise. Alibaba Beijing was also granted the Software Enterprise
          status and was thereby entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning from its first
          profitable taxation year of 2017, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three consecutive years
          starting from the taxation year of 2019. Accordingly, Alibaba Beijing was entitled to an EIT rate of
          12.5% (50% reduction in the standard statutory rate) during the taxation years of 2019, 2020 and 2021.
          Alibaba Beijing also obtained notification of recognition as a KSE for the taxation year of 2019 in the
          quarter ended September 30, 2020. Accordingly, Alibaba Beijing, which had applied an EIT rate of
          12.5% for the taxation year of 2019, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation year of
          2019 in the consolidated income statement for the year ended March 31, 2021.

     The total tax adjustments for the recognition of KSE status for Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China,
     Alibaba Beijing and certain other PRC subsidiaries of the Company, amounting to RMB4,144 million,
     RMB6,085 million and nil, were recorded in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March
     31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

     For the taxation years of 2020 and 2021, Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China, China Co. and Alibaba
     Beijing did not obtain the KSE status, and accordingly, Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China and China
     Co. continued to apply an EIT rate of 15% as High and New Technology Enterprises, and Alibaba Beijing
     applied an EIT rate of 12.5% (50% reduction in the standard statutory rate) as a Software Enterprise.

     Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31,
     2020, 2021 and 2022.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report     346

      7.   Income tax expenses (Continued)

           Composition of income tax expenses (Continued)
           Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to their
           foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with at least
           25% equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the relevant requirements
           pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R. Since the equity holders
           of the major PRC subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies and meet the
           relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R.,
           the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are anticipated
           to be distributed. As of March 31, 2022, the Company has accrued the withholding tax on substantially
           all of the distributable earnings of the PRC subsidiaries, except for those undistributed earnings that the
           Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB176.4 billion.

           (i) Others primarily represents deferred tax assets for share-based awards, investments in equity method investees, equity
               securities and other investments, as well as accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under PRC tax laws.
           (ii) The related deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2021 and 2022 were provided on the assumption that substantially all of
                the distributable earnings of PRC subsidiaries will be distributed as dividends, except for those undistributed earnings that
                the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB195.3 billion and RMB176.4 billion, respectively.
           (iii) Deferred tax liabilities for investments in equity method investees mainly includes the deferred tax effect on the gain in
                 relation to the receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group of RMB19.7 billion (Note 4(k)). Others primarily represents
                 deferred tax liabilities for investments in equity securities and other investments.

           Valuation allowances provided on the deferred tax assets mainly related to the tax losses carried forward
           due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization. If events occur in the future that improve the certainty
           of realization, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will be made and consequently income tax
           expenses will be reduced.

      8.   Share-based awards

           (a) Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company
                Share-based awards such as RSUs, incentive and non-statutory stock options, restricted shares,
                dividend equivalents, share appreciation rights and share payments may be granted to any directors,
                employees and consultants of the Company or affiliated companies under equity incentive plans
                adopted since the inception of the Company. Currently, the 2014 Post-IPO Equity Incentive Plan (the
                “2014 Plan”), which was adopted in September 2014 and has a ten-year term, is in effect and governs
                the terms of the awards. If an award terminates, expires or lapses, or is canceled for any reason,
                ordinary shares subject to the award become available for the grant of a new award under the
                2014 Plan. Starting from April 1, 2015 and on each anniversary thereof, an additional amount equal
                to the lesser of (A) 200,000,000 ordinary shares, and (B) such lesser number of ordinary shares as
                determined by the board of directors becomes available for the grant of a new award under the 2014
                Plan. All share-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan are subject to dilution protection should
                the capital structure of the Company be affected by a share split, reverse share split, share dividend
                or other dilutive action. As of March 31, 2022, the number of shares authorized but unissued was
                295,352,672 ordinary shares.

                Following the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change as detailed in Note 2 (a), each ordinary
                share was subdivided into eight ordinary shares and each ADS represents eight ordinary shares. Pro-
                rata adjustments have been made to the number of ordinary shares underlying each share-based
                award granted, so as to give the participants the same proportion of the equity that they would have
                been entitled to prior to the Share Subdivision. Subsequent to the Share Subdivision, eight ordinary
                shares are issuable upon the vesting or the exercise of one share-based award. The Share Subdivision
                has no impact on the number of share-based awards, the weighted average grant date fair value and
                the weighted average exercise price per share-based award as stated below.

           (a) Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
                Share options (Continued)
                As of March 31, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options was RMB2,032 million.
                As of the same date, the aggregate intrinsic value of options that were vested and exercisable
                and options that were vested and expected to vest was RMB1,194 million and RMB1,969 million,
                respectively.

                During the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the weighted average grant date fair value
                of share options granted was US$57.33, nil and US$103.72, respectively, and the total grant date
                fair value of options vested during the same years was RMB295 million, RMB335 million and RMB306
                million, respectively. During the same years, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options exercised
                was RMB1,011 million, RMB468 million and RMB137 million, respectively.

                Cash received from option exercises under the share option plans for the years ended March 31, 2020,
                2021 and 2022 was RMB960 million, RMB205 million and RMB109 million, respectively.

                No share options were granted during the year ended March 31, 2021. The fair value of each option
                granted during the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2022 is estimated on the measurement date
                using the Black-Scholes model by applying the assumptions below:

                                                                                                  Year ended March 31,
                                                                                              2020                 2021                2022
                 Risk-free interest rate (i)                                                 1.68%                     –     1.93%-2.00%
                 Expected dividend yield (ii)                                                   0%                     –                  0%
                 Expected life (years) (iii)                                                   4.50                    –         3.71-7.14
                 Expected volatility (iv)                                                    34.7%                     –              35.7%

                (i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
                    life of the share options in effect on the measurement date.
                (ii) Expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its
                     ordinary shares.
                (iii) Expected life of share options is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise of share options.
                (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company in the period equal to the expected life
                     of each grant.

                As of March 31, 2022, there were RMB437 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
                outstanding share options, net of expected forfeitures. These amounts are expected to be recognized
                over a weighted average period of 3.5 years.

                During the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company recognized share-based
                compensation expense of RMB140 million, RMB159 million and RMB86 million, respectively, in
                connection with the above share options.

                                                            For the Years Ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022




8.   Share-based awards (Continued)
     (a) Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
         Partner Capital Investment Plan
         The Company adopted the Partner Capital Investment Plan in 2013 to offer selected management
         of the Company rights or interests to acquire restricted shares of the Company. The rights or
         interests offered before 2016 were subject to a non-compete provision and were accounted for as
         noncontrolling interests of the Company as these rights or interests were issued by the Company’s
         subsidiaries and classified as equity at the subsidiary level. The rights or interests offered in the
         subsequent periods were subject to certain service provisions that were not related to employment
         and were accounted for as share options issued by the Company.

         During the year ended March 31, 2022, all rights and interests under the Partner Capital Investment
         Plan have been converted, exercised or replaced with grants under the 2014 Plan. No further
         subscription of rights or interests under the Partner Capital Investment Plan will be made hereafter.

         Share-based compensation expense of RMB425 million, RMB224 million and RMB177 million was
         recognized in connection with these rights or interests for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and
         2022, respectively.

     (b) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group
         The employees of the Company hold share-based awards granted by Ant Group and Hangzhou
         Junhan Equity Investment Partnership (“Junhan”), a major equity holder of Ant Group. These awards
         tied to the valuation of Ant Group and will be settled by respective grantors upon disposal of these
         awards by the holders, vesting or exercise of these awards, depending on the forms of these awards.
         In addition, Junhan and Ant Group have the right to repurchase the vested awards (or any underlying
         equity for the settlement of the vested awards) granted by them, as applicable, from the holders
         upon an initial public offering of Ant Group or the termination of the holders’ employment with the
         Company at a price to be determined based on the then fair market value of Ant Group.

         For accounting purposes, these awards meet the definition of a financial derivative. The cost
         relating to these awards is recognized by the Company and the related expense is recognized over
         the requisite service period in the consolidated income statements with a corresponding credit to
         additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these awards are recorded in the
         consolidated income statements. The expenses relating to these awards are re-measured at the fair
         value on each reporting date until their settlement dates. The fair value of the underlying equity is
         primarily determined with reference to the business enterprise value, or BEV, of Ant Group which is
         based on the contemporaneous valuation report, external information and information obtained from
         Ant Group.

         During the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company recognized expenses of
         RMB1,261 million, RMB17,315 million and a net reversal of RMB11,585 million, respectively, in respect
         of the share-based awards relating to Ant Group.

         Starting from April 2020, the parties agreed to settle with each other the cost associated with certain
         share-based awards granted to each other’s employees upon vesting. The settlement amounts under
         this arrangement depend on the values of Ant Group share-based awards granted to the Company’s
         employees and the Company’s share-based awards granted to employees of Ant Group, in which the
         net settlement amount is insignificant to the Company.

         Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company and Ant Group are generally subject
         to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the plans. Depending on the
         nature and the purpose of the grant, share-based awards generally vest 25% or 50% upon the first
         or second anniversary of the vesting commencement date, respectively, as provided in the award
         agreements, and 25% every year thereafter. Share-based awards granted to certain management
         members of the Company are subject to a vesting period of up to six years.

      9.   Earnings per share/ADS
           Following the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change as detailed in Note 2(a), each ordinary share
           was subdivided into eight ordinary shares and each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

           Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
           weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, adjusted for treasury shares. Basic earnings per
           ADS is derived from the basic earnings per share after the ADS Ratio Change.

           For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic
           earnings per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including share-based awards, under the
           treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities, of which the amounts are insignificant, have been
           excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted
           earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per share after the ADS Ratio Change.

   than their aggregate unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2021 and 2022 by RMB90 million and
   RMB(3,248) million, respectively. Unrealized (losses) gains recorded on these convertible and exchangeable
   bonds in the consolidated income statements were RMB(1,651) million, RMB1,573 million and RMB(3,112)

   due to the fact that the related effective interest rates approximate rates currently offered by financial
   institutions for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

      12. Fair value measurement
           Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
           orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability
           of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to
           measure fair value:

           Level 1   —    Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
                          markets.
           Level 2   —    Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as
                          quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
                          or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are
                          observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
           Level 3   —    Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions, consistent with reasonably
                          available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require
                          significant judgment.


           Fair value of listed equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
           liabilities. Certain other financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts and certain option
           agreements, are valued based on inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
           Valuations of convertible and exchangeable bonds that do not have a quoted price are generally
           performed using valuation models such as the binomial model with unobservable inputs including
           risk-free interest rate and expected volatility. The valuation of contingent consideration is performed
           using an expected cash flow method with unobservable inputs including the probability to achieve
           the contingencies, which is assessed by the Company, in connection with the contingent consideration
           arrangements. Investments in privately held companies for which the Company elected to record using the
           measurement alternative are re-measured on a non-recurring basis, and are categorized within Level 3
           under the fair value hierarchy. The values are estimated based on valuation methods using the observable
           transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, as well as
           rights and obligations of the securities.

   (i) During the year ended March 31, 2021, additions under the Core commerce segment primarily included the acquisition of
       Sun Art (Note 4(a)).
   (ii) During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company allocated its goodwill primarily as a result of the change in segments
        (Note 26).

   Gross goodwill balances were RMB297,250 million and RMB299,201 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2022,
   respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were RMB4,479 million and RMB29,620 million as of March
   31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

   In the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of certain
   reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and recorded impairment losses of RMB576 million,
   nil and RMB25,141 million during the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During
   the year ended March 31, 2022, considered the changes in market conditions, the Company performed
   quantitative impairment tests on certain reporting units under the Digital media and entertainment
   segment and recognized impairment charges of RMB14,754 million relating to one listed reporting unit
   and RMB10,387 million relating to one unlisted reporting unit. The fair value of the listed reporting unit
   is determined based on its market capitalization, adjusted for control premium. The fair value of the
   unlisted reporting unit is determined using the income approach, which is based on the discounted cash
   flow analysis derived from assumptions of future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. The
   goodwill impairment is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information (Note 26) because the
   CODM of the Company does not consider this as part of the segment operating performance measure.

            Long-term other borrowings (iii)                                                                   12,182              12,913
                                                                                                               38,335              38,244

           (i) As of March 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had short-term borrowings from banks which were repayable within one
               year or on demand and charged interest rates ranging from 0.6% to 12.5% and 0.6% to 12.5% per annum, respectively.
               As of March 31, 2021 and 2022, the weighted average interest rate of these borrowings was 2.9% and 2.8% per annum,
               respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB or HK$.
           (ii) As of March 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had a US$4.0 billion syndicated loan, which was entered into with a group of
                eight lead arrangers. The loan was priced at 85 basis points over LIBOR and will mature in May 2024. Certain related floating
                interest payments are hedged by certain interest rate swap contracts entered into by the Company. The proceeds of the loan
                were used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions).
           (iii) As of March 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had long-term borrowings from banks with weighted average interest rates of
                 4.3% and 4.1% per annum, respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB.

           In April 2017, the Company obtained a revolving credit facility provided by certain financial institutions for
           an amount of US$5.15 billion, which has not yet been drawn down. The interest rate on any outstanding
           utilized amount under this credit facility was calculated based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. This facility
           is reserved for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions). In June 2021, the
           terms of this credit facility were amended and the amount of the credit facility was increased to US$6.5
           billion. The expiration date of the credit facility was extended to June 2026. Under the amended terms of
           the credit facility, the interest rate on any outstanding utilized amount will be calculated based on LIBOR
           plus 80 basis points.

           As of March 31, 2022, the borrowings will be due according to the following schedule:

                                                                                                                     Principal amounts

                 As a marketing initiative, the Company entered into a framework agreement with the International
                 Olympic Committee (the “IOC”) and the United States Olympic Committee in January 2017 for a long-
                 term partnership arrangement through 2028. Joining in The Olympic Partner worldwide sponsorship
                 program, the Company has become the official “E-Commerce Services” Partner and “Cloud Services”
                 Partner of the IOC. In addition, the Company has been granted certain marketing rights, benefits
                 and opportunities relating to future Olympic Games and related initiatives, events and activities. The
                 Company committed to provide at least US$815 million worth of cash, cloud infrastructure services
                 and cloud computing services, as well as marketing and media support in connection with various
                 Olympic initiatives, events and activities, including the Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games
                 through 2028.

      25. Risks and contingencies
           (a)   The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and considered as a foreign entity under PRC
                 laws. Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
                 added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
                 the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses through various contractual
                 arrangements with VIEs that are incorporated and owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned
                 and/or controlled by PRC citizens. The VIEs hold the licenses and approvals that are essential for
                 their business operations in the PRC and the Company has entered into various agreements with the
                 VIEs and their equity holders such that the Company has the right to benefit from their licenses and
                 approvals and generally has control of the VIEs. In the Company’s opinion, the current ownership
                 structure and the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders as well as the
                 operations of the VIEs are in substantial compliance with all existing PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                 However, there may be changes and other developments in PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                 Accordingly, the Company gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view
                 in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of
                 the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found
                 to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct
                 its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership
                 structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in
                 deconsolidation of the VIEs.

25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (b)   The PRC market in which the Company operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks
         and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of the Company to operate or invest in
         online and mobile commerce or other Internet related businesses, representing the principal services
         provided by the Company, in the PRC. The information and technology industries are highly regulated.
         Restrictions are currently in place or are unclear regarding what specific segments of these industries
         foreign owned enterprises, like the Company, may operate. If new or more extensive restrictions
         were imposed on the segments in which the Company is permitted to operate, the Company could
         be required to sell or cease to operate or invest in some or all of its current businesses in the PRC.
         These uncertainties also extend to the PRC’s regulations relating to anti-monopoly and anti-unfair
         competition. In December 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation of the PRC (the “SAMR”)
         commenced an investigation on the Company pursuant to the PRC Anti-monopoly Law. Following the
         investigation, in April 2021, the SAMR issued an administrative penalty decision of the anti-monopoly
         investigation into the Company and imposed a fine of RMB18.2 billion (Note 19), which was accrued
         for as of March 31, 2021. The amount has been paid as of March 31, 2022. The SAMR also issued
         an administrative guidance, instructing the Company to implement a comprehensive rectification
         program, and to file a self-assessment and compliance report to the SAMR for three consecutive
         years.

   (c)   PRC regulators have enhanced their scrutiny over financial technology, or fintech, businesses, and
         have proposed or promulgated several new measures and rules to strengthen regulations over certain
         financial industries in which Ant Group operates, such as digital payment, wealth management,
         micro financing and insurance. Ant Group has also been in discussions with PRC regulators about
         its business. In December 2020, Ant Group announced that it would establish a rectification working
         group and bring the operation and development of its finance-related businesses in line with
         regulatory requirements. In April 2021, Ant Group announced that under the regulators’ guidance,
         and in accordance with regulatory requirements, Ant Group had completed the formulation of its
         rectification plan, according to which Ant Group would apply to set up a financial holding company
         to ensure its financial-related businesses are fully regulated. To implement the rectification plan and
         comply with applicable new measures and rules, Ant Group may be required to spend significant
         time and resources and make changes to its businesses. As a result of regulatory developments,
         Ant Group’s business operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
         Given that Ant Group offers a variety of services and products that have become essential parts of
         the services and experience the Company offers to consumers and merchants on the Company’s
         platforms, rectification and other regulatory requirements placed on Ant Group could in turn have a
         material adverse effect on the Company.

   (d)   The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its indebtedness. The Company also has
         interest bearing assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted
         cash. Certain of the Company’s indebtedness carries floating interest rates based on a spread over
         LIBOR. As a result, the interest expenses associated with these indebtedness will be subject to the
         potential impact of any fluctuation in LIBOR. The Company uses derivatives, such as interest rate
         swaps, to manage its interest rate exposure, and has entered into various agreements with various
         financial institutions as counterparties to swap a certain portion of its floating interest rate debt to
         effectively become fixed interest rate debt. Uncertainties surrounding the phase-out of LIBOR may
         cause a sudden and prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, could adversely affect the Company’s
         operating results and financial condition, as well as the Company’s cash flows. In addition, since
         LIBOR will not be available, the Company may need to further negotiate with its lenders to agree on
         an alternative basis of interest, which may result in an interest rate differing from the Company’s
         expectations and could materially affect the cost of these facilities to the Company.

      For the Years Ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022




      25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
           (e)   The Company’s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a
                 significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely
                 convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to
                 be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People’s Bank of
                 China (the “PBOC”).

                 Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in the PRC must be processed through the
                 PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory bodies and require certain supporting documentation
                 in order to effect the remittance. If the foreign exchange control system prevents the Company from
                 obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able
                 to pay dividends in foreign currencies and the Company’s ability to fund its business activities that are
                 conducted in foreign currencies could be adversely affected.

           (f)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes strategic investments to increase the service
                 offerings and expand capabilities. The Company continually reviews its investments to determine
                 whether there is a decline in fair value below the carrying value. Fair value of the listed securities is
                 subject to volatility and may be materially affected by market fluctuations.

           (g)   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk
                 consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and equity
                 securities and other investments. As of March 31, 2021 and 2022, substantially all of the Company’s
                 cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash were held by major financial
                 institutions located worldwide, including mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R. If the financial
                 institutions and other issuers of financial instruments held by the Company could become insolvent or
                 if the markets for these instruments could become illiquid as a result of a severe economic downturn,
                 the Company could lose some or all of the value of its investments.

           (h)   During the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company offered a trade assurance
                 program on the international wholesale marketplaces at no charge to the wholesale buyers and
                 sellers. If the wholesale sellers who participate in this program do not deliver the products in their
                 stated specifications to the wholesale buyers on schedule, the Company may compensate the
                 wholesale buyers for their losses on behalf of the wholesale sellers up to a pre-determined amount
                 following a review of each particular case. In turn, the Company will seek a full reimbursement
                 from the wholesale sellers for the prepaid reimbursement amount, yet the Company is exposed
                 to a risk over the collectibility of the reimbursement from the wholesale sellers. During the years
                 ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company did not incur any material losses with respect
                 to the compensation provided under this program. Given that the maximum compensation for each
                 wholesale seller is pre-determined based on their individual risk assessments by the Company
                 considering their credit profile or other relevant information, the Company determined that the
                 likelihood of material default on the payments are not probable and therefore no provisions have
                 been made in relation to this program.

25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (i)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
         and litigations in relation to disputes relating to trademarks and other intellectual property, among
         others. In 2017, Beijing Jingdong Shiji Trading Co., Ltd. and Beijing Jingdong 360 E-commerce Co., Ltd.
         sued Tmall China, Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Limited for abuse of
         dominant market position. The plaintiffs requested the three defendants to cease relevant acts and
         claimed a substantial amount of damages in the original complaint. In March 2021, the plaintiffs
         amended their claim to seek higher damages. The case is pending in Beijing High People’s Court
         and the potential damages are not reasonably estimable at the current stage. There are no legal
         proceedings and litigations that have in the recent past had, or to the Company’s knowledge, are
         probable to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial positions, results of operations or
         cash flows. The Company did not accrue any material loss contingencies in this respect as of March
         31, 2021 and 2022.

   (j)   The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant negative impact on the global
         economy, which has adversely affected the Company’s business and financial results. Starting
         in late January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a series of lock-downs, social distancing
         requirements and travel restrictions that have significantly and negatively affected, and may continue
         to negatively affect, our various businesses in China, particularly the Company’s China commerce
         and local consumer services businesses. The Company’s key international commerce businesses also
         experienced a negative impact. The COVID-19 pandemic also presented and may continue to present
         challenges to the Company’s business operations as well as the business operations of the Company’s
         merchants, business partners and other participants in the Company’s ecosystem, such as closure of
         offices and facilities, disruptions to or even suspensions of normal business and logistics operations,
         as well as restrictions on travel. It is not possible to determine the ultimate impact of the COVID-19
         pandemic on the Company’s business operations and financial results, which is highly dependent
         on numerous factors, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and any resurgence of the
         COVID-19 pandemic in China or elsewhere, actions taken by governments, the response of businesses
         and individuals to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on business and economic conditions in
         China and globally, consumer demand, the Company’s ability and the ability of merchants, retailers,
         logistics service providers and other participants in the Company’s ecosystem to continue operations
         in areas affected by the pandemic and the Company’s efforts and expenditures to support merchants
         and partners and ensure the safety of the Company’s employees. The COVID-19 pandemic may
         continue to adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

   (k)   The Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in significant disruptions to supply chains, logistics and
         business activities in the region that has negatively affected our international commerce business
         and Cainiao’s international logistics business. The conflict has also caused, and continues to intensify,
         significant geopolitical tensions in Europe and across the globe. The resulting sanctions imposed
         are expected to have significant impacts on the economic conditions of the countries and markets
         targeted by such sanctions, and may have unforeseen, unpredictable secondary effects on global
         energy prices, supply chains and other aspects of the global economy. The conflict may adversely
         affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

      26. Segment information
           The Company presents segment information after elimination of inter-company transactions. In general,
           revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses are directly attributable, or are allocated, to each
           segment. The Company allocates costs and expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific
           segment, such as those that support infrastructure across different segments, to different segments mainly
           on the basis of usage, revenue or headcount, depending on the nature of the relevant costs and expenses.
           The Company does not allocate assets to its segments as the CODM does not evaluate the performance of
           segments using asset information.

           Starting from the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the CODM started to review information under a new
           reporting structure, and segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change, which also provides
           greater transparency in the Company’s business progress and financial performance (Note 2(e)). The
           following tables present the summary of each segment’s revenue, income from operations and adjusted
           earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Adjusted EBITA”) which is considered as a segment
           operating performance measure, for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Comparative figures
           for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 were recast to conform to the segment presentation for the
           year ended March 31, 2022.

                                                                                                           Year ended March 31, 2020
