              Alibaba Group Announces December Quarter 2023 Results
Hangzhou, China, February 7, 2024 – Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988
(HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced its financial
results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.

“We delivered a solid quarter as we are executing our focused strategies across the organization. Our top
priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up
investment to improve users’ core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen
market leadership in the coming year. We will also focus our resources on developing public cloud products
and sustaining the strong growth momentum in international commerce business,” said Eddie Wu, Chief
Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.

“Alibaba Group delivered a healthy quarter with revenue growth of 5% year-over-year. We increased our
investment in strategic priorities and improved shareholder return by leveraging our strong balance sheet and
cash flow. Our board of directors approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program,
demonstrating our confidence in the outlook of our business and cash flow. Our consistent share repurchase
has also reduced outstanding share count while achieving EPS and cash flow per share accretion,” said Toby
Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

In the quarter ended December 31, 2023:

   •   Revenue was RMB260,348 million (US$36,669 million), an increase of 5% year-over-year.

   •   Income from operations was RMB22,511 million (US$3,171 million), a decrease of 36% year-
       over-year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to impairment of intangible assets
       of Sun Art and impairment of goodwill of Youku. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement
       (excluding share-based compensation expense, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and
       certain other items), increased 2% year-over-year to RMB52,843 million (US$7,443 million).

   •   Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB14,433 million (US$2,033 million).
       Net income was RMB10,717 million (US$1,509 million), a decrease of 77% or RMB35,029 million
       year-over-year, primarily attributable to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and
       the decrease in income from operations due to the impairment as mentioned above. Excluding share-
       based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of intangible assets and
       goodwill, and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023
       was RMB47,951 million (US$6,754 million), a decrease of 4% compared to RMB49,932 million in
       the same quarter of 2022.

   •   Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB5.65 (US$0.80) and diluted earnings per share was
       RMB0.71 (US$0.10 or HK$0.78). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB18.97
       (US$2.67), a decrease of 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was
       RMB2.37 (US$0.33 or HK$2.62), a decrease of 2% year-over-year.

                                                     1
   •   Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB64,716 million (US$9,115 million), a decrease
       of 26% compared to RMB87,370 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP
       measurement of liquidity, was RMB56,540 million (US$7,963 million), a decrease of 31% compared
       to RMB81,514 million in the same quarter of 2022. The decrease in free cash flow was attributed to
       increased capex and several one-time factors including timing of income tax payments and working
       capital changes related to several of our businesses.

BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES

Taobao and Tmall Group

We are in the process of revitalizing Taobao and Tmall Group and positioning it for future growth. Our
growth strategy is to put users first, build ecosystem for brands and merchants to thrive on our platform, and
realize technology-driven innovation. We are committed to building an e-commerce ecosystem where
brands, merchants and manufacturers operate with high efficiency, thereby providing multi-tiered Chinese
consumers with good products and services at attractive prices. In December 2023, we appointed a new
management team to execute Taobao and Tmall Group’s strategy and drive business growth through
technological innovation.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Taobao and Tmall Group was RMB129,070 million
(US$18,179 million), a growth of 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, online GMV achieved healthy
growth year-over-year, with the number of transacting buyers and order volume growing strongly, partly
offset by decrease in average order value. Under our user engagement and price-competitive strategies, we
continued to increase interactive content and broaden the assortment of value-for-money products.
Additionally, we continued our efforts to onboard a wider range of brands and merchants. The number of
merchants operating on our platform during the quarter continued to grow at double digits year-over-year,
and this double-digit growth trend has sustained over the past four quarters.

Following a successful 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, order volume grew double digits year-over-year
during the second half of the quarter. This reflected increasing consumer demand and willingness to make
purchases on our platform driven by our price-competitive strategy.

On the other hand, we have been successful in retaining and growing premium shoppers as the number of
88VIP members continued to increase double digits year-over-year, surpassing 32 million.

Cloud Intelligence Group

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28,066 million
(US$3,953 million), a growth of 3% year-over-year. We continue to improve revenue quality by reducing
the revenue from low-margin project-based contracts. On the other hand, revenue from public cloud
products and services grew healthily which contributed to profitability improvement.

Recent highlights of our proprietary products and technology include:

   •   Elastic Compute: In January 2024, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its newest general-purpose ECS
       instance g8i, which significantly boosts overall performance and AI inferencing capabilities.

   •   Database: In the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems
       report, Alibaba Cloud was named a Leader for the fourth year in a row.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (“AIDC”)

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from AIDC grew 44% year-over-year to RMB28,516
million (US$4,016 million), and the combined orders of AIDC grew 24% year-over-year. The strong
performance was driven by solid growth across all of AIDC’s retail platforms, especially from the cross-
border AliExpress Choice business. Our cross-border businesses exhibited rapid year-over-year growth in
response to increasing global demand for high-quality products at attractive prices. To sustain this
momentum and provide differentiated services to customers, we increased investments during this quarter
and will continue to invest in further growth.

During the quarter, AliExpress delivered over 60% year-over-year order growth, driven by Choice, which
provides an enhanced experience to consumers by combining better product selection, price and quality with
speed of logistics and great customer support. Choice represented about half of AliExpress’ total orders in
January 2024 and continues to deliver rapid order growth.

During the quarter, Trendyol continued its robust double-digit order growth. While maintaining its leading
e-commerce position in Türkiye, Trendyol has further extended its operations into the Middle East with a
wide range of merchandise as well as speedy and reliable logistics experience.

Lazada continues to focus on optimizing its operating efficiency. With further increased monetization and
decreased logistics costs, Lazada’s loss per order continued to narrow year-over-year during the quarter.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited (“Cainiao”)

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cainiao grew 24% year-over-year to RMB28,476
million (US$4,011 million), primarily driven by revenue from cross-border fulfillment solutions.

Cainiao continues to execute its strategy of building a global smart logistics network, reinforcing
comprehensive end-to-end capabilities in first-mile pick-up, line haul, customs clearance, sortation, and last-
mile delivery. To support cross-border business development, with the upgrade of end-to-end capabilities,
Cainiao further expanded its premium 5-day delivery service coverage, adding two more countries during
the quarter. The order volume for the premium 5-day delivery service achieved robust triple-digit quarter-
over-quarter growth.

Local Services Group

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Local Services Group grew 13% year-over-year to
RMB15,160 million (US$2,135 million), driven by healthy growth of Ele.me and rapid growth of Amap.
During this quarter, order growth of Local Services Group exceeded 20% year-over-year. Local Services
Group’s annual active consumers reached over 390 million and their annual purchasing frequency grew
strongly year-over-year for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. For this quarter, its losses
continued to narrow driven by improving business scale and efficiency.

Digital Media and Entertainment Group

During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue of Digital Media and Entertainment Group was
RMB5,040 million (US$710 million), an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by strong revenue growth
of offline entertainment businesses of Alibaba Pictures. During the quarter, Damai, a subsidiary of Alibaba
Pictures, consolidated its industry-leading position by servicing almost all the major concerts in China,
which contributed to rapid GMV growth year-over-year. Total box office of movies produced, promoted and
distributed by Alibaba Pictures’ movie segment accounted for more than half of China’s total box office
during the quarter.

Updates on ESG Initiatives

Progress in Decarbonization

We continue to accelerate our transition to clean energy. In November 2023, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance released the “China's Top Clean Energy Buyers and Sellers in 2023.” Alibaba Group, with a green
electricity transaction volume of 1,610 gigawatt-hours, became the national leader for green electricity
procurement for the first time.

In November 2023, Alibaba Group was the first Asian Internet technology company to join the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a group of over 200 businesses, to support
WBCSD’s drive to make global value chains more sustainable. At COP28, Alibaba Group together with
WBCSD and other corporate members, advocated for “Scope 3+” carbon reduction actions by promoting the
"Guidance on Avoided Emissions" report.

Upsize of Share Repurchase Program

As previously announced, during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 292.7
million ordinary shares (equivalent of 36.6 million ADSs) for a total of US$2.9 billion, and a total of 897.9
million ordinary shares (equivalent of 112.2 million ADSs) for a total of US$9.5 billion during the 2023
calendar year. As of December 31, 2023, we had 20.0 billion ordinary shares (equivalent of 2.5 billion
ADSs) outstanding. Our share repurchase program resulted in a net reduction of 3.3% in our outstanding
shares in the 2023 calendar year after accounting for shares issued under our ESOP.

Our board of directors has approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program through
the end of March 2027. Following this upsize, we currently have US$35.3 billion available under our share
repurchase program through the next three fiscal years. We have undertaken to update investors on our share
repurchases immediately after the end of each quarter with the next update expected to be published in early
April.

    items from our non-GAAP measurements.

 Taobao and Tmall Group

 (i)        Segment revenue

        •   China Commerce Retail Business

            Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was
            RMB123,762 million (US$17,432 million), an increase of 1% compared to RMB122,736 million in
            the same quarter of 2022.

            Customer management revenue remained stable year-over-year, primarily due to healthy growth in
            online GMV generated on Taobao and Tmall, excluding unpaid orders, partly offset by decline in
            overall take rate. The overall take rate decreased slightly year-over-year mainly because the increase
            in GMV came from Taobao merchants.

            Direct sales and others revenue under China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December
            31, 2023 was RMB31,649 million (US$4,458 million), an increase of 2% compared to RMB31,042
            million in the same quarter of 2022.

        •   China Commerce Wholesale Business

            Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was
            RMB5,308 million (US$747 million), an increase of 23% compared to RMB4,329 million in the
            same quarter of 2022,primarily due to an increase in revenue from value-added services provided to
            paying members.

 (ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

            Taobao and Tmall Group adjusted EBITA increased by 1% to RMB59,930 million (US$8,441
            million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to RMB59,245 million in the same
            quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to narrowing losses in certain businesses, partly
            offset by an increase in investment in content, user acquisition and retention of Taobao app, as well
            as technological innovation.

 Cloud Intelligence Group

 (i)        Segment revenue

            Revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28,066 million (US$3,953 million) in the quarter
            ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% compared to RMB27,364 million in the same quarter
            of 2022. Year-over-year revenue growth was mainly driven by Alibaba-consolidated businesses.
            Revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated businesses decreased year-over-year, primarily due to the
            decrease in revenue from low-margin project-based contracts as a result of continued effort to
            improve revenue quality. However, revenue from our public cloud products and services experienced
            healthy year-over-year growth.

                                                                9
(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Cloud Intelligence Group adjusted EBITA increased by 86% to RMB2,364 million (US$333 million)
           in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to RMB1,269 million in the same quarter of
           2022, primarily due to improving product mix through our focus on public cloud and operating
           efficiency.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group

(i)        Segment revenue

       •   International Commerce Retail Business

           Revenue from our International commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2023
           was RMB23,260 million (US$3,276 million), an increase of 56% compared to RMB14,954 million
           in the same quarter of 2022. The increase in revenue was primarily due to solid combined order
           growth of AIDC’s retail businesses driven by the strong performance of all its major retail platforms,
           the revenue contribution from AliExpress Choice as well as improvements in monetization. As
           certain of our international businesses generate revenue in local currencies while our reporting
           currency is Renminbi, AIDC’s revenue is affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

       •   International Commerce Wholesale Business

           Revenue from our International commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31,
           2023 was RMB5,256 million (US$740 million), an increase of 8% compared to RMB4,870 million
           in the same quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by
           cross-border related value-added services.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB3,146 million
           (US$443 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB645 million in
           the same quarter of 2022. Losses increased year-over-year primarily because of increased investment
           in businesses including AliExpress Choice and Trendyol’s international business, partly offset by
           improvement in monetization.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited

(i)        Segment revenue

           Revenue from Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited was RMB28,476 million (US$4,011
           million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 24% compared to RMB23,023
           million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from cross-
           border fulfillment solutions.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited adjusted EBITA was a profit of RMB961 million
           (US$135 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB12 million in
           the same quarter of 2022. The year-over-year increase reflected economies of scale that leads to cost
           optimization as well as optimized operating expenditure spending. This also reflected Cainiao’s
           continuous effort in cost optimization in line-haul transportation and last-mile delivery.

       was a loss of RMB517 million (US$73 million), compared to a loss of RMB391 million in the same

       December 31, 2023, a decrease of 7% compared to RMB50,334 million in the same quarter of 2022,
       mainly due to the decrease in revenue from Sun Art, driven by the scale down of supply chain
       business and the decrease in ticket size.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Adjusted EBITA from All others segment in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was a loss of
       RMB3,172 million (US$447 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,698 million in the same quarter
       of 2022, primarily due to an increase in year-over-year loss from Sun Art due to scale down of
       certain of its businesses.

value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.

(1) Others mainly include basis differences arising from equity method investees, share-based compensation expense related to share-based
    awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or loss arising from the deemed disposal of the equity method
    investees.

We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The year-over-year
decrease in share of profit of Ant Group was mainly due to the increase in Ant Group’s net investment loss,
whilst its operating profit was largely flat.

Net income and Non-GAAP net income

Our net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB10,717 million (US$1,509 million),
compared to RMB45,746 million in the same quarter of 2022, which was primarily attributable to mark-to-
market changes from our equity investments and the decrease in income from operations due to impairment.

Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments,
impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization and impairment of intangible assets and certain other
items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB47,951 million (US$6,754
million), a decrease of 4% compared to RMB49,932 million in the same quarter of 2022. A reconciliation of
net income to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this results announcement.

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB14,433
million (US$2,033 million), compared to RMB46,815 million in the same quarter of 2022, which was
primarily attributable to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and the decrease in income
from operations due to impairment, partly offset by an increase in impairment of intangible assets
attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share

Diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB5.65 (US$0.80), compared to
RMB17.91 in the same quarter in 2022. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and
disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization and impairment
of intangible assets and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended
December 31, 2023 was RMB18.97 (US$2.67), a decrease of 2% compared to RMB19.26 in the same
quarter of 2022.

                                                                     15
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB0.71 (US$0.10 or HK$0.78),
compared to RMB2.24 in the same quarter of 2022. Excluding share-based compensation expense,
revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization
and impairment of intangible assets and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the
quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB2.37 (US$0.33 or HK$2.62), a decrease of 2% compared to
RMB2.41 in the same quarter of 2022.

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share is
included at the end of this results announcement. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments

As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, were RMB652,962
million (US$91,968 million), compared to RMB560,314 million as of March 31, 2023. Other treasury
investments mainly comprise of investments in fixed deposits and certificates of deposits with original
maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and other treasury investments during the nine months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily
due to free cash flow generated from operations of RMB140,849 million (US$19,838 million), effect of
exchange gain of RMB8,949 million (US$1,260 million) mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar
against Renminbi, and net cash provided by investment and acquisition activities of RMB3,289 million
(US$463 million), partly offset by cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB54,731 million
(US$7,709 million) and repayment of unsecured senior notes of US$700 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow

During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was RMB64,716
million (US$9,115 million), a decrease of 26% compared to RMB87,370 million in the same quarter of
2022. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB56,540 million (US$7,963 million),
a decrease of 31% compared to RMB81,514 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease
in free cash flow was attributed to increased capex and several one-time factors including timing of income
tax payments and working capital changes related to several of our businesses. A reconciliation of net cash
provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this results announcement.

Net cash used in investing activities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of RMB30,925 million
(US$4,356 million) primarily reflected (i) an increase in other treasury investments by RMB14,559 million
(US$2,051 million), (ii) capital expenditure of RMB8,857 million (US$1,247 million), (iii) an increase in
short-term investments by RMB5,477 million (US$771 million), and (iv) cash outflow of RMB4,833 million
(US$680 million) for investment and acquisition activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash
inflow of RMB3,333 million (US$469 million) from disposal of investments.

Net cash used in financing activities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of RMB17,214 million
(US$2,424 million) primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB20,706 million
(US$2,916 million), partially offset by net proceeds from bank borrowings of RMB2,955 million (US$416
million).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to
the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by
the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted
earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our
core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and
operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA,


                                                     19
adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency
to investors about our operating results.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate
transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS
and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from
operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or
as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not
have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures
differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, share-based
compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of
property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights, impairment of goodwill, and
others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-
settled donation expense), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during
the periods presented.

Adjusted EBITA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other
income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, share-based compensation
expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and others (including
provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation
expense), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods
presented.

Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization and
impairment of intangible assets, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments,
impairment of goodwill and investments, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the
ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation expense), and adjustments for the tax effects.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash
flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and
construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through
acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer
protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from
investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating
business operations. We exclude “acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to
office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and
are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection
fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of
compensating buyers for claims against merchants.

measures.

(1) See the table above for the reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income for more information of these non-GAAP
    adjustments.
(2) Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.
(3) Diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
    number of outstanding ordinary shares, on a diluted basis. Diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per
    share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
(4) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders
    by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, on a
    diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting
    for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
