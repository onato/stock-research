Hangzhou, China, November 16, 2023 – Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988
(HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced its financial
results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

“Alibaba Group delivered a solid quarter, marked by renewed momentum and energy across multiple
businesses as a result of our strategic reorganization. As we embark on a new phase of development, we
have clearly defined our strategic focus and priorities. We will maintain an entrepreneurial mindset. We are
committed to investing for growth and making bold decisions where necessary. Through a more flexible
organizational governance mechanism, we aim to capture brand new opportunities from the ongoing AI
technological transformation and create more value for our customers,” said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive
Officer of Alibaba Group.

“We achieved a stable quarter with revenue increasing 9% year-over-year and income from operations and
adjusted EBITA increasing 34% and 18% year-over-year, respectively,” said Toby Xu, Chief Financial
Officer of Alibaba Group. “Under our capital management plan, we are prioritizing investment in
technology and innovations for our businesses to drive new growth. We are confident in our business
fundamentals and are pleased to announce our first annual dividend distribution for fiscal year 2023, with an

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

In the quarter ended September 30, 2023:

   •   Revenue was RMB224,790 million (US$30,810 million), an increase of 9% year-over-year.

   •   Income from operations was RMB33,584 million (US$4,603 million), an increase of 34% year-
       over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to an increase in adjusted EBITA,
       as well as a decrease in share-based compensation expense. We excluded share-based compensation
       expense from our non-GAAP measurements. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement,
       increased 18% year-over-year to RMB42,845 million (US$5,872 million).

       Net income was RMB26,696 million (US$3,659 million), compared to net loss of RMB22,467
       million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to a net gain arising from the increase in
       fair value of our equity investments, compared to a net loss from these investments in the same
       quarter last year, and an increase in adjusted EBITA. We excluded net gains or losses arising from
       the changes in fair value of our investments from our non-GAAP measurements. Non-GAAP net
       income was RMB40,188 million (US$5,508 million), an increase of 19% year-over-year.

   •   Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB10.77 (US$1.48) and diluted earnings per share was

       GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB45,220 million (US$6,198 million), an increase of 27%
       compared to RMB35,709 million in the same quarter of 2022.
BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES

Taobao and Tmall Group

Our Taobao and Tmall Group’s strategy is to put users first, build an ecosystem for brands and merchants to
thrive on our platform, and realize AI technology-driven innovation. Taobao app is at the core of this
strategy as a one-stop destination for consumption and daily life needs serving the largest number of users.
We continue to improve the value proposition of Taobao app by (i) increasing content to encourage user
engagement, (ii) enhancing price-competitive product supply by onboarding more merchants and targeting
more effectively, and (iii) introducing AI applications and tools to improve user experience and seller
efficiency.

For the month ended September 30, 2023, we achieved healthy year-over-year organic growth of Taobao
app users as a result of our content and price-competitive strategy. Our investments to provide more
interactive content led to strong growth in user time spent on short-form video content. Importantly, the
number of transacting buyers and order volume also increased during the quarter, as we continue to increase
interactive content and broaden assortment of price-competitive products offered by both existing and new
merchants. In addition, the number of 88VIP members increased double-digits year-over-year, surpassing 30
million during the quarter. Taobao and Tmall Group successfully concluded its 15th annual 11.11 Global
Shopping Festival, which recorded positive year-over-year growth in participating merchants, transacting
buyers and order volume compared to the same period last year.

Taobao and Tmall Group continues to expand AI products and services for its merchant operation platform
and monetization platform (Alimama). It now offers AI tools that simplify and automate online store
operations, such as new store design, product photo and description generation, customer service and
financial and order management, all of which improve merchants’ operating efficiency. Additionally, in
August, Taobao and Tmall Group upgraded one of its key advertising platforms, Wanxiangtai Unbounded
Edition (万相台⽆界版), with the aim of growing the number of merchants who advertise with us by
facilitating them to allocate their advertising budgets in all available properties within the Alibaba ecosystem
using a single interface. The updated edition features AI technologies that provide (i) data analysis and
insights to optimize advertising spending, (ii) marketing tools that intelligently locate targeted customers and
(iii) AI-generated content for advertising. These proprietary AI technologies enhance merchants’ efficiency
and improve conversion and return on investment for merchants. We have seen strong adoption of
Wanxiangtai Unbounded Edition by both new and existing merchants during the quarter.

Xianyu (闲⻥), a fun community and marketplace, continues to grow strongly with DAU up over 20% year-
over-year in the month ended September 30, 2023. Through Xianyu, users can find a rich variety of
secondhand, recycled, for-rent and vintage products as well as interest-based content. Its revenue, which
consists of advertising, commission and value-added services such as fees from product recycling,
consignment sales and product inspection, grew rapidly year-over-year during the quarter.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (“AIDC”)

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group operates various retail and wholesale marketplaces including
Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Daraz, Miravia and Alibaba.com. During the September quarter, the

                                                       2
combined order growth of AIDC’s retail businesses was approximately 28% year-over-year, driven by solid
performance from all major retail platforms. During the quarter, revenue from AIDC exhibited robust
growth, increasing by 53% year-over-year.

AliExpress is executing its growth strategy under multiple business models – the established marketplace
business, which saw double-digit growth year-over-year in the number of orders during this quarter, and
Choice, a new model launched in early 2023 through which AliExpress delivers enhanced experience to
consumers by working with merchants to ensure better control of product selection and quality as well as
speed of logistics. Choice works closely with Cainiao to improve consumer experience, recently rolling out
a 5-day delivery guarantee program in selected European countries. As a result the order volume of Choice
ramped up rapidly during the quarter.

Lazada recorded double-digit order growth year-over-year during the quarter. Lazada continues to focus on
improving monetization. As a result, losses per order narrowed quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.

Trendyol delivered robust order growth while investing in its expansion outside Türkiye. By leveraging its
product sourcing capabilities and supply chain advantages, Trendyol further expanded its footprint in the
region.

Local Services Group

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, revenue from Local Services Group grew 16% year-over-year to
RMB15,564 million (US$2,133 million), driven by strong growth in both Ele.me and Amap businesses.
During this quarter, order growth of Local Services Group was nearly 20% year-over-year. Annual active
consumers of Local Services Group for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 continued to grow
quarter-over-quarter due to improved acquisition and retention of consumers as well as increasing user
demand. For this quarter, its losses continued to narrow driven by improving overall business scale and
efficiency.

To-Home

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Ele.me’s overall order volume, consisting of both restaurant and
non-restaurant orders, grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by increasing number of
transacting users and higher purchase frequency per user. As a result of successful marketing campaigns,
Ele.me’s restaurant delivery orders grew by double-digits year-over-year this quarter. In addition, Ele.me is
making significant progress in the non-restaurant delivery category. During the quarter, non-restaurant
delivery orders also grew by double-digits year-over-year, driven by strong consumer demands during
festivals and marketing campaigns, such as flower delivery on Chinese Valentine’s Day, “24/7 Medicine
Delivery” service campaign, and new iPhone 15 launch on September 22, 2023. For the quarter ended
September 30, 2023, Ele.me’s losses continued to narrow year-over-year driven by improving operating
efficiency and increasing scale.

To-Destination

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, order growth of Amap increased rapidly year-over-year, due to
its strengthening position as a comprehensive “To-Destination” service platform as well as strong travel
demand during this summer season. During an eight-day holiday period from September 29 to October 6
that combined Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, Amap recorded an all-time high of over 280
million peak daily active users as the Chinese economy experienced strong recovery in travel demand.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited (“Cainiao”)

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, revenue from Cainiao grew 25% year-over-year to RMB22,823
million (US$3,128 million), primarily driven by revenue from cross-border fulfillment solutions.

Cainiao continues to execute its strategy of building a global smart logistics network, reinforcing
comprehensive end-to-end capabilities in cross-border logistics solutions. During the quarter, Cainiao rolled
out its premium 5-day delivery service for consumers in eight countries and regions. The project leverages
Cainiao’s comprehensive capabilities in full-chain operational optimization across first-mile pick-up, line
haul, customs clearance, sortation, and last-mile delivery.

Cainiao leverages technology to remain competitive. To support AliExpress’ Choice expansion, Cainiao
provided parcel bundling and direct shipping capabilities through data analytics and algorithms that reduce
delivery time and improve efficiency.

Cloud Intelligence Group

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB27,648 million
(US$3,789 million), a growth of 2% year-over-year.

We continue to improve revenue quality by reducing the revenue from project-based contracts that are of
low margins. On the other hand, revenues from public cloud products and services increased during this
quarter which drove improved profitability.

From October 31 to November 2, we held our 15th annual cloud computing developer summit and
exhibition, the Apsara Conference 2023, during which Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group unveiled new
technologies that had been under development. Highlights of our proprietary technologies include:

   •   Generative AI Models: Alibaba’s proprietary large language model (LLM) Tongyi Qianwen (通义
       千问) launched an upgraded 2.0 version, with strong capabilities in understanding complex
       instructions, reasoning, memorizing and reducing hallucination. We also rolled out eight vertical
       models for specific industries including finance and gaming, as well as business enhancement
       capabilities such as code generation and customer support.

   •   Ecosystem: We have built one of the largest open-source AI developer communities in China. Our
       developer community ModelScope has gathered over 2,300 AI models, attracting 2.8 million AI
       developers and over 100 million cumulative model downloads since the launch of this community.
       We are also making available the open-source version of our Tongyi Qianwen models in
       ModelScope, which we have announced will include a version with 72 billion-parameter after the
       launch of our 7 billion-parameter and 14 billion-parameter models.

   •   Alibaba Cloud Bailian (阿⾥云百炼): One-stop AI application development platform Alibaba
       Cloud Bailian, which provides LLM application development services in one single platform
       offering a range of high performing foundation models including those from third parties. It
       simplifies the large model training process and allows developers to focus on model application
       innovation. In addition, it provides a secure environment for customer data protection during the
       training process.

Alibaba Cloud supported the first “Asian Games on the Cloud,” to facilitate more intelligent, sustainable,
sophisticated and efficient Asian Games. Using cloud-native technology running on Alibaba Cloud’s
container services, we enabled more agile, scalable and efficient operations of the event.

Digital Media and Entertainment Group

During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, revenue of Digital Media and Entertainment Group was
RMB5,779 million (US$792 million), an increase of 11% year-over-year, driven by strong revenue growth
of offline entertainment businesses of Damai and Alibaba Pictures, as well as increase in Youku’s
subscription revenue, partly offset by the decrease in Youku’s advertising revenue.

Businesses within the segment continue to achieve synergies. On September 19, 2023, Alibaba Pictures
announced its acquisition of Damai, aiming to leverage Damai's leading position in the offline performance
market to expand influence in the offline entertainment industry. Benefiting from the recovery of offline
entertainment market and strong demand in the summer, Damai maintained its industry-leading position
with triple-digit GMV growth and improving profitability year-over-year during the quarter. In August,
Damai and Youku jointly sold tickets of TFBoys’ 10th anniversary concert, for offline performance and
online broadcasting, respectively. The exclusive online broadcasting attracted more than 1.68 million
viewers and achieved more than 100 million times of interaction, which broke the record for online paid
performances on Youku.

China’s box office during the summer movie season hit record high this year. No More Bets (孤注⼀掷) and
Lost in the Stars (消失的她), both co-produced by Alibaba Pictures, were the top two performers in terms of
box office in China during summer vacation. Chang’an (⻓安三万⾥), an animation for which Alibaba
Pictures was the co-producer, leading promoter and distributor, was the best performing animation movie in
terms of box office so far in 2023.

All Others

DingTalk

Starting from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we reclassified the result of our DingTalk business,
which was previously reported under Cloud Intelligence Group to All others, the purpose of which was to
provide DingTalk with greater autonomy to promote innovation and enhance competitiveness.

DingTalk, our digital collaboration workplace and application development platform, offers new ways of
working, sharing and collaboration through the integration of latest AI models. As of September 30, 2023,
17 product lines of DingTalk had been fully integrated with large models. DingTalk also opened up its
intelligent AI PaaS platform to customers and ecosystem partners, which will help participants in the
ecosystem reinvent their products.

Updates on ESG Initiatives

Empowering More Sustainable and Inclusive Asian Games

Alibaba Group contributed to promote the sustainability and inclusiveness of the 19th Asian Games and the
4th Asian Para Games in Hangzhou.

   •   Alibaba Cloud introduced its digital avatar, Xiaomo (小莫), which supports two-way translation
       between sign language and Chinese spoken language. Xiaomo provided on-site assistance to
       audience with hearing impairments during the Asian Para Games.

   •   Amap, by leveraging its “Wheelchair Navigation” feature, assisted Hangzhou Disabled Persons’
       Federation in the technological upgrade of its “Online Accessible Service” platform in order to
       provide users with more detailed accessible travel planning and navigation services.

Enhancing Community Resilience

In August 2023, Alibaba Foundation donated RMB30 million to support Typhoon “Doksuri” rescue efforts
in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province and other regions. Alibaba Philanthropy mobilized Freshippo (Hema),
RT-Mart, 1688.com and other businesses to strengthen supply chains and distribute emergency supplies
across severely impacted regions. Alibaba Philanthropy Platform has also launched an online flood relief
initiative which provides public fundraising channels for other non-profit organizations.

Impacts of Recent U.S. Export Controls Expansion

In October 2023, the United States expanded its export control rules to further restrict the export to China of
advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. We believe that these new
restrictions may materially and adversely affect Cloud Intelligence Group’s ability to offer products and
services and to perform under existing contracts, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and
financial condition. These new restrictions may also affect our businesses more generally by limiting our
ability to upgrade our technological capabilities.

Update on Business Group Spin-offs and Capital Raisings

Cloud Intelligence Group

The recent expansion of U.S. restrictions on export of advanced computing chips has created uncertainties
for the prospects of Cloud Intelligence Group. We believe that a full spin-off of Cloud Intelligence Group
may not achieve the intended effect of shareholder value enhancement. Accordingly, we have decided to not
proceed with a full spin-off, and instead we will focus on developing a sustainable growth model for Cloud
Intelligence Group under the fluid circumstances.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group is in preparation for external fundraising.

Cainiao

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited has applied for an initial public offering in Hong Kong and has
submitted its A1 filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Freshippo (Hema)

Freshippo (Hema)’s plan for an initial public offering has been put on hold as we evaluate market conditions
and other factors that would contribute to a successful transaction to enhance shareholder value.

Shareholder Return Activities

per ordinary share or US$1.00 per ADS, payable in U.S. dollars, to holders of ordinary shares and holders of
ADSs, as of the close of business on December 21, 2023, Hong Kong Time and New York Time,
respectively. The aggregate amount of the dividend will be approximately US$2.5 billion. Going forward,
we will continue to review and determine the dividend amount based on factors such as business
fundamentals, capital requirements, among others, on an annual basis.

For holders of ordinary shares, in order to qualify for the dividend, all valid documents for the transfers of
shares accompanied by the relevant share certificates must be lodged with the Company’s Hong Kong

for holders of ordinary shares and on or around January 18, 2024 for holders of ADSs.

In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 18.6 million ADSs
(the equivalent of 148.4 million ordinary shares) for approximately US$1.7 billion under our share
repurchase program. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 20.3 billion ordinary shares (the
equivalent of 2.5 billion ADSs) outstanding, a reduction of 138.9 million ordinary shares (the equivalent of

 Taobao and Tmall Group

 (i)        Segment revenue

        •   China Commerce Retail Business

            Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was
            RMB92,560 million (US$12,687 million), an increase of 3% compared to RMB89,436 million in the
            same quarter of 2022.

            Customer management revenue increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in
            merchant’s willingness to invest in advertising, partly offset by the modest decline in online GMV
            generated on Taobao and Tmall, excluding unpaid order.

            Direct sales and others revenue under China commerce retail business in the quarter ended
            September 30, 2023 was RMB23,899 million (US$3,276 million), an increase of 6% compared to
            RMB22,559 million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to strong sales driven by the
            consumer electronics and appliances.

        •   China Commerce Wholesale Business

            Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was
            RMB5,094 million (US$698 million), an increase of 18% compared to RMB4,299 million in the
            same quarter of 2022,primarily due to an increase in revenue from value-added services provided to
            paying members.

 (ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

            Taobao and Tmall Group adjusted EBITA increased by 3% to RMB47,077 million (US$6,453
            million) in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to RMB45,635 million in the same
            quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to narrowing losses in certain businesses and
            increase in profit from customer management service, partly offset by the increase in investment in
            user acquisition and retention as well as in content of Taobao app.


 Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group

 (i)        Segment revenue

        •   International Commerce Retail Business

            Revenue from our International commerce retail business in the quarter ended September 30, 2023
            was RMB18,978 million (US$2,602 million), an increase of 73% compared to RMB10,990 million
            in the same quarter of 2022. The increase in revenue was primarily due to strong combined order
            growth of AIDC’s retail businesses driven by the solid performance of all major retail platforms, the


                                                                12
           revenue contribution from AliExpress’ Choice, a new model launched in early 2023, and
           improvements in monetization. Because certain of our international businesses generate revenue in
           local currencies while our reporting currency is Renminbi, AIDC’s revenue is affected by exchange
           rate fluctuations.

       •   International Commerce Wholesale Business

           Revenue from our International commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended September 30,
           2023 was RMB5,533 million (US$758 million), an increase of 9% compared to RMB5,056 million
           in the same quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by
           cross-border related value-added services.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB384 million
           (US$53 million) in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB748 million in
           the same quarter of 2022. Losses significantly narrowed year-over-year primarily because of
           improved margins of Lazada and Trendyol, partly offset by the increase in investment in new
           business, such as Miravia, and AliExpress’ Choice. Lazada reduced loss mainly due to improvement
           in monetization. Trendyol continued to be profitable during the quarter, mainly due to improvements
           in monetization and operating efficiency.

Local Services Group

(i)        Segment revenue

           ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 16% compared to RMB13,381 million in the same quarter
           of 2022, primarily due to the strong growth in both Ele.me and Amap businesses.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Local Services Group adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB2,564 million (US$351 million) in the
           quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to a loss of RMB3,328 million in the same quarter of
           2022, primarily due to the continued narrowing of loss from our “To-Home” business driven by
           Ele.me’s improved unit economics per order and increasing scale.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited

(i)        Segment revenue

           Revenue from Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited was RMB22,823 million (US$3,128
           million) in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 25% compared to RMB18,282
           million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from cross-
           border fulfillment solutions.

(ii)       Segment adjusted EBITA

           Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited adjusted EBITA was RMB906 million (US$124 million)
           in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to RMB125 million in the same quarter of 2022.

           fulfillment solutions, technology and other services, as well as domestic logistics services.

Cloud Intelligence Group

(i)    Segment revenue

       Revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB27,648 million (US$3,789 million) in the quarter
       ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2% compared to RMB27,035 million in the same quarter
       of 2022. Year-over-year revenue growth was mainly driven by Alibaba-consolidated businesses.
       Revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated businesses slightly decreased year-over-year, primarily due
       to our continued effort to improve revenue quality by reducing the revenue from project-based
       contracts that are of low margins, and such decrease was mostly offset by the increase in revenue
       from our public cloud products and services.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Cloud Intelligence Group adjusted EBITA increased by 44% to RMB1,409 million (US$193 million)
       in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to RMB981 million in the same quarter of 2022,
       primarily due to improving product mix and operating efficiency.

(i)    Segment revenue

       Revenue from Digital Media and Entertainment Group was RMB5,779 million (US$792 million) in
       the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 11% compared to RMB5,228 million in the
       same quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the strong revenue growth of offline entertainment
       businesses of Damai and Alibaba Pictures, as well as the increase in Youku’s subscription revenue,
       partly offset by the decrease in Youku’s advertising revenue.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Digital Media and Entertainment Group adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended September 30, 2023
       was a loss of RMB201 million (US$28 million), compared to a loss of RMB362 million in the same
       quarter of 2022. The improved adjusted EBITA was mainly due to the increase in profitability of
       Damai and Alibaba Pictures.

All Others

       Revenue from all others segment, which was RMB48,052 million (US$6,586 million) in the quarter
       ended September 30, 2023, remained stable compared to RMB48,142 million in the same quarter of
       2022, primarily due to the revenue growth contributed by Freshippo, Fliggy, Alibaba Health and
       Intelligent Information Platform, partly offset by the decrease in revenue from Sun Art due to
       decrease in ticket size resulting from the decrease in consumer stockpiling behavior compared to the
       same quarter last year.

(ii)   Segment adjusted EBITA

       Adjusted EBITA from all others segment in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was a loss of

 (2) This represents Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, which is subject to mark-to-market accounting
     treatment.
 (3) This represents share-based awards of our subsidiaries.

Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards decreased in the quarter
ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the
general decrease in the average fair market value of the awards granted.

We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair
value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.

Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended September 30,
2023 was RMB2,431 million (US$333 million), a decrease of 11% from RMB2,729 million in the same
quarter of 2022.

Income from operations and operating margin

Income from operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was RMB33,584 million (US$4,603
million), or 15% of revenue, an increase of 34% compared to RMB25,137 million, or 12% of revenue, in the
same quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to an increase in adjusted EBITA, as well as a decrease in share-
based compensation expense.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA

Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% year-over-year to RMB49,237 million (US$6,748 million) in the quarter
ended September 30, 2023, compared to RMB43,311 million in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITA

30, 2023, compared to RMB36,164 million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily contributed by revenue
growth and improved operating efficiency. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA and

million (US$704 million), compared to a loss of RMB42,452 million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily
due to a net gain arising from the increase in fair value of our equity investments, compared to a net loss
from these investments in the same quarter last year.

compared to RMB2,572 million in the same quarter of 2022.

impairment of investments, as well as the deferred tax effects on basis differences arising from our equity
method investees, our effective tax rate would have been 18% in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

(1) “Others” mainly include basis differences arising from equity method investees, share-based compensation expense related to share-based
    awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or loss arising from the deemed disposal of the equity method
    investees.

We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The year-over-year
decrease in share of profit of Ant Group which reflected a RMB7.07 billion fine on Ant Group imposed by
PRC regulators announced in July 2023.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Ant Group repurchased approximately 7% equity interest
from its existing shareholders and the shares repurchased were allocated to the employee incentive plans
of Ant Group. The number of shares held by us in Ant Group remains unchanged from legal perspective,
our equity interest in Ant Group on a fully diluted basis remains unchanged at 33%.

For U.S. GAAP accounting purposes, we will take into consideration a proportionate share of equity
interest held by the employee incentive plans of Ant Group to account for our share of results from our
investment in Ant Group, subject to dilution as the equity interest under the employee incentive plans of
Ant Group is transferred out.

a net gain arising from the increase in fair value of our equity investments, compared to a net loss from these
investments in the same quarter last year, and an increase in adjusted EBITA.

As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, were RMB624,501

investments mainly comprise of investments in fixed deposits and certificates of deposits with original
maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and other treasury investments during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily
due to free cash flow generated from operations of RMB84,309 million (US$11,556 million), effect of
exchange rate changes of RMB14,247 million (US$1,953 million) mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S.
dollar against Renminbi, and net cash provided by investment and acquisition activities of RMB4,789
million (US$656 million), partly offset by cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB34,025 million

an increase of 27% compared to RMB35,709 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The year-
over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in profitability and a decrease in capital expenditure,
partly offset by net changes in working capital. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities
to free cash flow is included at the end of this results announcement.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to
the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by
the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted
earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our
core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and
operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA,


                                                      22
adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency
to investors about our operating results.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate
transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS
and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from
operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or
as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not
have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures
differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation
and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights, impairment
of goodwill, as well as equity-settled donation expense which we do not believe are reflective of our core
operating performance during the periods presented.

Adjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of
goodwill and equity-settled donation expense which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating
performance during the periods presented.

Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization of
intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and investments, gain or loss on deemed
disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, equity-settled donation expense and others, as adjusted for
the tax effects.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash
flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and
construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through
acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer
protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from
investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating
business operations. We exclude “acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to
office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and
are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection
fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of
compensating buyers for claims against merchants.

The table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP
Measures” in this results announcement have more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are

                                                     23
most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these
financial measures.
