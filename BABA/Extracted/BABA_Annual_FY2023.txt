                         Our founders started our company to champion small businesses, in the belief                   we aspire to be a good company that will last for 102 years.
                         that the Internet would level the playing field by enabling small enterprises to
                         leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more effectively in                     For a company that was founded in 1999, lasting for 102 years means we will have
                         domestic and global economies. We believe that concentrating on customer                       spanned three centuries, an achievement that few companies can claim. Our culture,

entrepreneur reinterprets the
traditional culture of handmade
cloth shoes with new ideas
Chao Xiong, a Taobao store owner born after 1995 who studied fashion design, believes that
‘driving trends with tradition’ can go a long way. Therefore, she taught herself the traditional
soling technique of handmade cloth shoes and started her own business. She was inspired by lion
dance teams that did performance tours in the villages every Chinese New Year, so she came up
with the idea of sewing dancing lion patterns on the shoes as her signature product. Chao Xiong
joined the Taobao craftsmanship initiative with fellow detailed-focused craftspeople, and together,
they spearhead a fashionable trend of “recreating tradition,” which reinterprets traditional culture
through creativity and focus among young entrepreneurs.

     Tong Niu is a young man who returned to China after studying abroad. His father develops
     peach orchards in Baiya Village, Fuping County, Baoding, Hebei Province. Tong Niu, who had
     no experience with planting, learned the process along with three classmates who had also
     returned from Australia to help his father. Tong Niu subsequently worked with Alibaba’s rural
     commissioners and Freshippo’s Fuping yellow peach project manager to digitally transform yellow
     peach cultivation in his village by introducing automatic irrigation systems and drones to water and
     fertilize the peaches, and sensors to monitor the orchards in real-time. The quality of yellow peach
     has been standardized by applying these new technologies. The yellow peaches are now sold in
     Freshippo across major cities and this new source of economic activity has helped improve the
     villagers’ living quality.

fashion business from scratch
The early stages of running a new business are always challenging due to a lack of funds and
business experience. As a university student, Natnicha Rojchanasom, a female entrepreneur in
Thailand, started her own e-commerce business selling jeans on Lazada. Without any prior retail
sales experience, she launched a store on the Lazada platform. She tried to identify local market
demands by focusing on pre-orders and products that customers preferred the most. She also
leveraged Lazada Sponsored Solutions to attract more traffic to her store and increase the volume
of completed transactions. In addition, she participated in various sales campaigns on Lazada to
create awareness and raise her brand’s profile among potential customers. Today, she is a success
story and continues growing her business.

     HiBREW, a coffee machine brand in Shunde Foshan, used to focus on several developed markets
     overseas. Since engaging AliExpress in July 2019, it has expanded into new markets, including
     the Middle East. Given that the coffee machine is a product with relatively heavy weight, HiBREW
     relies on AliExpress’ platform capability to calculate shipping capacity precisely and improve cost生气
     efficiency through container consolidation and warehouse sharing. Afterward, it took the platform’s
     recommendation to deploy overseas warehouses in the Middle East to reduce logistics storage costs

Deltha Pharma was founded in 2009 in Rome and became a popular Italian food supplement
manufacturer. Despite the ups and downs in business, Maria Francesca Aceti, CEO of Deltha Pharma,
decided to join Alibaba.com in 2019. Undoubtedly, the pandemic brought many challenges to Italian
companies, and some were severely affected when offline sales were disrupted. However, Deltha
Pharma turned this challenge into opportunity by incorporating digitalization into its business model
through Alibaba.com. During the pandemic, there was a surge in demand for vitamins and health
supplement products. Through Alibaba.com, the brand was able to sell these products worldwide. It
is now partnering with a local university to develop innovative supplements and continue growing its
businesses.

wheelchair navigation to
improve accessibility

To alleviate the inconvenience of travel experienced by the disabled population and vulnerable
groups, Amap developed a wheelchair-accessible navigation feature with the support of the
Zhejiang Provincial Disabled Person’s Federation. It has been launched in cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen. The public service project of “Wheelchair
Navigation” was initiated by Alibaba staff volunteers, while engineers from Amap quickly joined
to support and launched the project three months later. “Wheelchair Navigation” was developed
to meet special travel needs based on the digitalization of accessible facilities. Together with
corresponding route planning and navigation strategies, it helps ease the anxiety of wheelchair
users and foster the development of an accessible environment.

     esophageal cancer symptoms. To address the challenges of identifying early-stage tumors, the
     research team focused on improving the segmentation algorithm model, which helps AI learn and
     analyze global characteristics and local details of the esophagus so that patients can be screened for
     early-stage esophageal cancer through a general physical examination using non-contrast CT.

Hess Action, which also includes certain allegations

public offering, asserts claims under Section 10(b) and
Section 20(a) of the U.S. Exchange Act.

to Consolidate and Motions for Appointment as
Lead Plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act, or the PSLRA, seeking consolidation
of the Ciccarello, Romnek, and Hess Actions and
appointment of Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel under
the PSLRA. The Court consolidated the three actions
on April 20, 2021, and appointed Lead Plaintiff on
February 10, 2022. On April 22, 2022, Lead Plaintiff
filed an Amended Complaint, naming a founder as an
additional defendant, and asserting new and existing
claims concerning the SAMR’s antitrust investigation
and fine and the suspension of Ant Group’s planned
initial public offering.

On July 21, 2022, defendants filed motions to dismiss
the Amended Complaint. On March 22, 2023, the Court
granted in part Defendants’ motions, among other
things, dismissing the founder and all allegations
relating to the suspension of Ant Group’s planned
initial public offering. The portion of the case related
to the SAMR’s antitrust investigation and fine is
proceeding to discovery, which is scheduled to
conclude in January 2025.

    individual segments. The goodwill impairment, and the equity-settled donation expense related to the allotment of shares to a
    charitable trust, are presented as unallocated items in the segment information because our management does not consider these
    as part of the segment operating performance measure.

      (1) Beginning on October 1, 2022, we reclassified the results of our Instant Supermarket Delivery (全能超市) business, which was
          previously reported under China commerce segment, to Local consumer services segment following the strategy refinement
          of Instant Supermarket Delivery business to focus on building customer mindshare for grocery delivery services through Ele.me
          platform. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance. Comparative figures were
          reclassified to conform to this presentation.
      (2) Unallocated expenses primarily relate to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to
          individual segments. The goodwill impairment, and the equity-settled donation expense related to the allotment of shares to a
          charitable trust, are presented as unallocated items in the segment information because our management does not consider these
          as part of the segment operating performance measure.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of
the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our
audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matters identified in our audit are summarized as follows:

•       Impairment assessment on goodwill relating to a reporting unit under the Digital media and entertainment
        segment

•       Fair value determination related to investments in privately held companies accounted for using the
        measurement alternative

                                                          Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge

                                                          We found that the assumptions adopted and
                                                          estimations made by management were supported

Other Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of
the information included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Directors and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
give a true and fair view in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and for such internal control as the directors determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not
assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.


                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report   277
      Independent Auditor’s Report


      As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
      scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

      •    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
           due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
           evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
           a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
           involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

      •    Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
           are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
           of the Group’s internal control.

      •    Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
           and related disclosures made by the directors.

      •    Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
           on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
           that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
           that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
           disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
           opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
           However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

      •    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
           the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
           and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

      •    Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
           business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
           are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
           responsible for our audit opinion.

      We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
      the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
      during our audit.

      We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
      regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
      reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats
      or safeguards applied.

      From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most
      significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
      key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
      disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be
      communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
      outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

      The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Shin Wai Kit Ricky.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies

     (a) Basis of presentation
          The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
          principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

          Translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement,
          consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows from
          RMB into the US$ as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023 are solely for the convenience of the
          readers and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8676, representing the exchange rate set
          forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 31, 2023. No representation
          is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at
          this rate, or at any other rate.

     (b) Use of estimates
          The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
          the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
          liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
          statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The
          Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
          believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
          carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company considered the economic implications of
          the COVID-19 pandemic on its significant judgments and estimates. Given the impact and other
          unforeseen effects on the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates required
          increased judgment, and actual results could differ from these estimates.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (c) Consolidation
                The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its
                subsidiaries, which include the PRC-registered entities directly or indirectly owned by the Company
                (“WFOEs”) and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) over which the Company is the primary beneficiary
                for accounting purposes only. All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries and
                the VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
                are recorded in the consolidated income statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the
                effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

                A subsidiary is an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the
                voting power; or (ii) the Company has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members
                of the board of directors or to cast a majority of votes at the meetings of the board of directors or
                to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee pursuant to a statute or under an
                agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. A VIE is required to be consolidated by the
                primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity holders in the entity do not have the characteristics
                of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
                activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

                Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
                added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
                the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment
                is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through various contractual arrangements with VIEs that are
                incorporated and owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by PRC citizens.
                Specifically, these representative PRC domestic companies are Zhejiang Taobao Network Co., Ltd.,
                Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Alibaba Advertising Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Ali Venture
                Capital Co., Ltd., Shanghai Rajax Information Technology Co., Ltd., Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd.
                and Alibaba Culture Entertainment Co., Ltd. The registered capital of these PRC domestic companies
                was funded by the Company through loans extended to the equity holders of these PRC domestic
                companies.

                The Company has entered into certain exclusive services agreements with these PRC domestic
                companies, which entitle it to receive substantially all of the profits of the VIEs. In addition, the
                Company has entered into certain agreements with the equity holders of these PRC domestic
                companies, including loan agreements that require them to contribute registered capital to those
                PRC domestic companies, exclusive call option agreements to acquire the equity interests in these
                companies when permitted by the PRC laws, rules and regulations, equity pledge agreements of
                the equity interests held by those equity holders, and proxy agreements that irrevocably authorize
                individuals designated by the Company to exercise the equity owner’s rights over these PRC domestic
                companies.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         Details of the typical structure of the Company’s representative VIEs are set forth below:

         Loan agreements
         Pursuant to the relevant loan agreements, the respective WFOEs have granted loans to the equity
         holders of the VIEs, which may only be used for the purpose of its business operation activities
         agreed by the WFOEs or the acquisition of the relevant VIEs. The WFOEs may require acceleration of
         repayment at their absolute discretion. When the equity holders of the VIEs make early repayment
         of the outstanding amount, the WFOEs or a third-party designated by the WFOEs may purchase the
         equity interests in the VIEs at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the loan, subject to any
         applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. The equity holders of the VIEs undertake not to enter into
         any prohibited transactions in relation to the VIEs, including the transfer of any business, material
         assets or equity interests in the VIEs to any third party.

         Exclusive call option agreements
         The equity holders of the VIEs have granted the WFOEs exclusive call options to purchase their equity
         interest in the VIEs at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the
         VIEs; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each relevant VIE has further
         granted the relevant WFOE an exclusive call option to purchase its assets at an exercise price equal
         to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws, whichever
         is higher. Certain VIEs and their equity holders will also jointly grant the WFOEs (A) exclusive call
         options to request the VIEs to decrease their registered capital at an exercise price equal to the higher
         of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the VIEs and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable
         PRC laws (the “Capital Decrease Price”), and (B) exclusive call options to subscribe for any increased
         capital of the VIEs at a price equal to the Capital Decrease Price, or the sum of the Capital Decrease
         Price and the unpaid registered capital, if applicable, as of the capital decrease. The WFOEs may
         nominate another entity or individual to purchase the equity interest or assets, or to subscribe for
         the increased capital, if applicable, under the call options. Execution of each call option shall not
         violate the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Each equity holder of the VIE has agreed that
         the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed
         to the VIE (after deduction of relevant tax expenses), belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs: (i)
         proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIE, (ii) proceeds received in connection with a
         capital decrease in the VIE, and (iii) distributions or liquidation residuals from the disposal of its equity
         interests in the VIE upon termination or liquidation. Moreover, any profits, distributions or dividends
         (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) received by the VIEs also belong to and shall be paid to the
         WFOEs. The exclusive call option agreements remain in effect until the equity interest or assets that
         are the subject of these agreements are transferred to the WFOEs.

         Proxy agreements
         Pursuant to the relevant proxy agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs irrevocably authorize any
         person designated by the WFOEs to exercise their rights of the equity holders of the VIEs, including
         without limitation the right to vote and appoint directors.

           (c) Consolidation (Continued)
                Equity pledge agreements
                Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs have pledged
                all of their interests in the equity of the VIEs as a continuing first priority security interest in favor of
                the corresponding WFOEs to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant loan
                agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the VIEs and/or the
                equity holders under the other structure contracts. Each WFOE is entitled to exercise its right to
                dispose of the pledged interests in the equity of the VIE held by the equity holders and has priority in
                receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of the pledged interests,
                in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other structure contracts, if
                applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until the later of (i) the full performance
                of the contractual arrangements by the relevant parties, and (ii) the full repayment of the loans made
                to the equity holders of the VIEs.

                Exclusive services agreements
                Each relevant VIE has entered into an exclusive services agreement with the respective WFOE,
                pursuant to which the relevant WFOE provides exclusive services to the VIE. In exchange, the VIE
                pays a service fee to the WFOE, the amount of which shall be determined, to the extent permitted by
                applicable PRC laws as proposed by the WFOE, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits
                from the VIE to the WFOE.

                Other arrangements
                The exclusive call option agreements described above also entitle the WFOEs to all profits,
                distributions or dividends (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by the equity
                holder of the VIEs, and the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital
                that they contributed to the VIEs (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by each
                equity holder of the VIEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIEs, (ii) proceeds
                received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIEs, and (iii) distributions or liquidation
                residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIEs upon termination or liquidation.

                Based on these contractual agreements, the Company believes that the PRC domestic companies as
                described above should be considered as VIEs because the equity holders do not have significant
                equity at risk nor do they have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Given that the
                Company is the primary beneficiary of these PRC domestic companies, the Company believes that
                these VIEs should be consolidated based on the structure as described above.

      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      For the Years Ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023



      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (c) Consolidation (Continued)
                The VIEs did not have any material related party transactions except for the related party transactions
                which are disclosed in Note 22 or elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, and those
                transactions with other subsidiaries that are not VIEs, which were eliminated upon consolidation.

                Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of
                the VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company
                considers that there is no asset in any of the VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the
                VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all VIEs are incorporated as limited
                liability companies under the Company Law of the corresponding jurisdictions, creditors of the VIEs do
                not have recourse to the general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the VIEs.

                Currently, there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional
                financial support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based
                on the licenses and approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to
                provide financial support to the VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs as well as the
                Company’s own business objectives in the future.

                Unrecognized revenue-producing assets held by the VIEs include certain Internet content provision
                and other licenses, domain names and trademarks. The Internet content provision and other licenses
                are required under relevant PRC laws, rules and regulations for the operation of Internet businesses
                in the PRC, and therefore are integral to the Company’s operations. The Internet content provision
                licenses require that core PRC trademark registrations and domain names are held by the VIEs that
                provide the relevant services.

           (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests
                The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting
                in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” The cost of an acquisition is measured as
                the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred to the sellers, liabilities
                incurred by the Company and equity instruments issued by the Company. Transaction costs directly
                attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
                assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the
                extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of
                the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in
                the acquiree over (ii) the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is
                recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the acquisition date amounts of the net
                assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income
                statements. During the measurement period, which can be up to one year from the acquisition
                date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the
                corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the conclusion of the measurement period or final
                determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any
                further adjustments are recorded in the consolidated income statements.

                                                            For the Years Ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023



2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests (Continued)
         In a business combination achieved in stages, the Company re-measures the previously held equity
         interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the
         re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated income statements.

         When there is a change in ownership interests or a change in contractual arrangements that results in
         a loss of control of a subsidiary, the Company deconsolidates the subsidiary from the date control is
         lost. Any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and is
         included in the calculation of the gain or loss upon deconsolidation of the subsidiary.

         For the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to
         reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. When the
         noncontrolling interest is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of a conditional event, which
         is not solely within the control of the Company, the noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine
         equity. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date that
         it becomes probable that the mezzanine equity will become redeemable to the earliest redemption
         date using the effective interest method. Consolidated net income in the consolidated income
         statements includes net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and mezzanine equity
         holders when applicable.

         Net income attributable to mezzanine equity holders is included in net loss attributable to
         noncontrolling interests in the consolidated income statements, while it is excluded from the
         consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity. During the years ended March 31, 2021,
         2022 and 2023, net income attributable to mezzanine equity holders amounted to RMB140 million,
         RMB188 million and RMB365 million, respectively. The cumulative results of operations attributable to
         noncontrolling interests, along with adjustments for share-based compensation expense arising from
         outstanding share-based awards relating to subsidiaries’ shares, are also recorded as noncontrolling
         interests on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows related to transactions with
         noncontrolling interests are presented under financing activities in the consolidated statements of
         cash flows.

     (e) Segment reporting
         Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to
         the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), which is comprised of certain members of the
         Company’s management team. Prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company had
         four operating and reportable segments, namely Core commerce, Cloud computing, Digital media
         and entertainment, and Innovation initiatives and others segments. Starting from the quarter
         ended December 31, 2021, the CODM started to review information under a new reporting structure,
         and segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change, which also provides greater
         transparency in the Company’s business progress and financial performance. Consequently,
         the Company presents seven operating and reportable segments as set out in Notes 1 and 26 to
         reflect the change. As of March 31, 2023, the Company was in the process of implementing a new
         organizational and governance structure. Following the implementation of the new organizational
         structure, the segment reporting will be updated to reflect the new reporting structure that will be
         reviewed by the CODM.

           (f)   Foreign currency translation
                 The functional currency of the Company is US$. The Company’s subsidiaries with operations in
                 Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC (“Hong Kong” or “Hong
                 Kong S.A.R.”), the United States and other jurisdictions generally use their respective local currencies
                 as their functional currencies. When the Company determines that a subsidiary is operating in a highly
                 inflationary economy, the financial statements of this subsidiary shall be remeasured prospectively
                 as if the functional currency were the functional currency of its immediate parent company. The
                 reporting currency of the Company is RMB as the major operations of the Company are within the
                 PRC. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than the subsidiaries with the
                 functional currency of RMB, are translated into RMB using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet
                 date for assets and liabilities and the average daily exchange rate for each month for income and
                 expense items. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
                 income or loss as a component of shareholders’ equity.

                 In the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than the
                 functional currency are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate
                 in effect at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
                 are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
                 currency using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising from foreign
                 currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated income statements during the year in which
                 they occur.

           (g) Revenue recognition
                 Revenue is principally comprised of customer management services revenue, membership fees,
                 logistics services revenue, cloud services revenue, sales of goods and other revenue. Revenue
                 represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of promised
                 goods or services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities and is recorded net of value-
                 added tax (“VAT”). Consistent with the criteria of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”,
                 the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control
                 of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point
                 in time, the Company also considers the following indicators to assess whether control of a promised
                 good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to payment, (ii) legal title, (iii) physical
                 possession, (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership and (v) acceptance of the good or service.
                 For performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue over time by
                 measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.

                 For revenue arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, each distinct performance
                 obligation is separately accounted for and the total consideration is allocated to each performance
                 obligation based on the relative standalone selling price at contract inception.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction to determine whether revenue
         should be recorded on a gross or net basis. The Company is acting as the principal if it obtains control
         over the goods and services before they are transferred to customers. Generally, when the Company
         is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices,
         or has several but not all of these indicators, the Company acts as the principal and revenue is
         recorded on a gross basis. Generally, when the Company is not primarily obligated in a transaction,
         does not bear the inventory risk and does not have the ability to establish the price, the Company acts
         as the agent and revenue is recorded on a net basis.

         When services are exchanged or swapped for other services, revenue is recognized based on the
         estimated standalone selling price of services promised to customer if the fair value of the services
         received cannot be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized for barter transactions
         was not material for each of the periods presented.

         Practical expedients and exemptions
         The Company applies the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
         obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts for
         which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services
         performed.

         The Company applies the practical expedient to not adjust any of the transaction price for the time
         value of money for contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services
         to the customer and payment by the customer is within one year.

         Revenue recognition policies by type are as follows:

         (i)   Customer management services revenue
               Within the Company’s China commerce and International commerce segments, the Company
               provides the following customer management services to merchants on the Company’s retail
               and wholesale marketplaces and certain third-party marketing affiliates’ websites:

               Pay-for-performance (“P4P”) marketing services
               P4P marketing services allow merchants to bid for keywords that match product or service
               listings appearing in search results on the Company’s marketplaces. Merchants bid for
               keywords through an online auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the
               positioning are determined through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery
               through a market-based mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for P4P marketing services
               and the related revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this
               is the point of time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report      299

                (i)   Customer management services revenue (Continued)
                      In-feed marketing services
                      In-feed marketing services allow merchants to bid to market to groups of consumers with similar
                      profiles that match product or service listings appearing in browser results on the Company’s
                      marketplaces. Merchants bid for groups of consumers with similar profiles through an online
                      auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning are determined
                      through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based
                      mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for in-feed marketing services and the related
                      revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the point of
                      time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.

                      Display marketing services
                      Display marketing services allow merchants to place advertisements on the Company’s
                      marketplaces, at fixed prices or prices established by a market-based bidding system and
                      in particular formats. In general, merchants need to prepay for display marketing which is
                      accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized either ratably over the period in
                      which the advertisement is displayed as the merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as
                      the advertisement is displayed or when an advertisement is viewed by users, depending on the
                      type of marketing services selected by the merchants.

                      The Company also places P4P marketing services content and display marketing services
                      content through the third-party marketing affiliate program. A substantial portion of customer
                      management services revenue generated through the third-party marketing affiliate program
                      represented P4P marketing services revenue. In delivery of these customer management
                      services, the Company, through the third-party marketing affiliate program, places the P4P
                      marketing services content of the participating merchants on third-party online resources in
                      the forms of picture or text links through contextual relevance technology to match merchants’
                      marketing content to the textual content of the third-party online resources and the users’
                      attributes based on the Company’s systems and algorithms. When the links on third-party online
                      resources are clicked, users are diverted to a landing page of the Company’s marketplaces
                      where listings of the participating merchant as well as similar products or services of other
                      merchants are presented. In limited cases, the Company may embed a search box for one of
                      its marketplaces on the third-party online resources, and when a keyword is input into the
                      search box, the user will be diverted to the Company’s marketplaces where search results are
                      presented. Revenue is recognized when the users further click on the P4P marketing content
                      on the landing pages. The Company places display marketing content on third-party online
                      resources in a similar manner. In general, merchants need to prepay for display marketing
                      which is accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized ratably over the period
                      in which the advertisement is displayed as merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as
                      the advertisement is displayed.

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         (i)   Customer management services revenue (Continued)
               Display marketing services (Continued)
               P4P marketing services revenue, in-feed marketing services revenue, as well as display
               marketing services revenue generated on the Company’s marketplaces or through the third-
               party marketing affiliate program are recorded on a gross basis when the Company is the
               principal to the merchants in the arrangements. For third-party marketing affiliates with
               whom the Company has an arrangement to share the revenue, traffic acquisition cost is also
               recognized at the same time if the P4P marketing content on the landing page clicked by the
               users is from merchants participating in the third-party marketing affiliate program.

               Commissions on transactions
               The Company earns commissions from merchants when transactions are completed on
               Tmall and certain other retail marketplaces of the Company. The commissions are generally
               determined as a percentage based on the value of merchandise being sold by the merchants.
               The commission revenue includes merchant deposits that are expected to be non-refundable
               and is accounted for as variable consideration (Note 2(ac)), which is estimated at contract
               inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes
               available. Revenue related to commissions is recognized in the consolidated income statements
               based on the expected value when the performance obligation is satisfied. Adjustments to the
               estimated variable consideration related to prior reporting periods were not material for each of
               the periods presented.

               Taobaoke services
               In addition, the Company offers the Taobaoke program which generates commissions from
               merchants for transactions completed by consumers sourced from certain third-party marketing
               affiliates’ websites and mobile apps. The commission rates on Taobaoke are set by the
               merchants. The Company’s commission revenue is recognized at the time when the underlying
               transaction is completed. The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction
               to determine whether the commission revenue is recognized on a gross or net basis. When
               the Company is the agent of the arrangement (such as arrangements where the Company
               does not have latitude in establishing prices or does not have inventory risk), the commission
               revenue is recorded on a net basis. When the Company is the principal of the arrangement
               (such as arrangements where the Company is obligated to pay for website inventory costs in
               fixed amounts to third-party marketing affiliates regardless of whether commission revenue
               is generated from these marketing affiliates), the commission revenue is recorded on a gross
               basis.




                                                                                 Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report    301

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                (ii)   Membership fees
                       The Company earns membership fees revenue from wholesale sellers in respect of the sale of
                       membership packages and subscriptions that allow them to host premium storefronts on the
                       Company’s wholesale marketplaces, as well as the provision of other value-added services,
                       and from customers in respect of the sale of membership packages which allow them to access
                       premium content on Youku’s paid content platforms. These service fees are paid in advance
                       for a specific contracted service period. All these fees are initially deferred as deferred revenue
                       and customer advances when received and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
                       respective service contracts as the services are provided.

                (iii) Logistics services revenue
                       The Company earns logistics services revenue from domestic and international one-stop-shop
                       logistics services and the supply chain management solutions provided by Cainiao Network and
                       Lazada as well as on-demand delivery services provided by Ele.me. Revenue is recognized at
                       the time when the logistics services are provided.

                (iv) Cloud services revenue
                       The Company earns cloud services revenue from the provision of cloud services such as
                       proprietary servers, computing, storage, network, security, database, big data, container,
                       machine learning, and model training and inference. Certain cloud services allow customers to
                       use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. These
                       cloud services are mainly charged on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue
                       related to cloud services charged on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract
                       period. Revenue related to cloud services charged on a consumption basis, such as the quantity
                       of storage or elastic computing services used in a period, is recognized based on the customer
                       utilization of the resources.

                       For the provision of hybrid cloud services, which include hardware, software licenses, software
                       installation services, application development and maintenance services, each distinct
                       performance obligation identified is separately accounted for and the total consideration is
                       allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices at
                       contract inception. Revenue for each performance obligation is recognized when the control of
                       the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
           (v)   Sales of goods
                 Revenue from the sales of goods is mainly generated from Sun Art, Tmall Supermarket and
                 Freshippo. Revenue from the sales of goods is recognized when the control over the promised
                 goods is transferred to customers. Receipts of fees in respect of all other incidental goods or
                 services provided by the Company that are distinct performance obligations are recognized
                 when the control of the underlying goods or services is transferred to the customers. The
                 amounts relating to these incidental services are not material to the Company’s total revenue for
                 each of the periods presented.

     (h) Cost of revenue
           Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of inventories, logistics costs, expenses associated with the
           operation of the Company’s mobile platforms and websites (such as depreciation and maintenance
           expenses for servers and computers, call centers and other equipment, and bandwidth and co-
           location fees), staff costs and share-based compensation expense, traffic acquisition costs, content
           costs, payment processing fees and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to
           the Company’s principal operations.

     (i)   Product development expenses
           Product development expenses consist primarily of staff costs and share-based compensation
           expense for research and development personnel and other expenses that are directly attributable to
           the development of new technologies and products for the businesses of the Company, such as the
           development of the Internet infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and
           networks.

           The Company expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and
           implementation phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance
           of the existing websites or the development of software and website content. Costs incurred in the
           development phase are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life. However, as
           the amount of costs qualified for capitalization has been insignificant, all website and software
           development costs have been expensed as incurred.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report    303

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (j)   Sales and marketing expenses
                 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising expenses, promotion
                 expenses, staff costs and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions and other related
                 incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers and merchants.

                 The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and
                 expenses the costs of delivering advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or
                 airtime is used. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled RMB57,073 million, RMB91,103 million
                 and RMB76,818 million during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

           (k) Share-based compensation
                 Share-based awards granted are measured at fair value on grant date and the value is recognized
                 as share-based compensation expense (i) immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions
                 are required, or (ii) using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
                 requisite service period. The fair values of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares are
                 determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying shares and the fair value of share
                 options is generally determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Share-based compensation
                 expense, when recognized, is charged to the consolidated income statements with the corresponding
                 entry to additional paid-in capital, liability or noncontrolling interests as disclosed in Note 2(d).

                 On each measurement date, the Company reviews internal and external sources of information to
                 assist in the estimation of various attributes to determine the fair value of the share-based awards,
                 including the fair value of the underlying shares, expected life and expected volatility. The Company
                 recognizes the impact of any revisions to the original forfeiture rate assumptions in the consolidated
                 income statements, with a corresponding adjustment to equity or liability.

           (l)   Other employee benefits
                 The Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer
                 defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits
                 are provided to employees. The relevant labor regulations require the Company’s subsidiaries in
                 the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions based on the
                 applicable benchmarks and rates stipulated by the local government. The relevant local labor and
                 social welfare authorities are responsible for meeting all retirement benefits obligations and the
                 Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC have no further commitments beyond their monthly contributions.
                 The contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred. The Company also makes payments to other
                 defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for the benefit of employees employed by
                 subsidiaries outside of the PRC.

                 During the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, contributions to the plans amounting to
                 RMB8,223 million, RMB13,086 million and RMB13,953 million, respectively, were charged to the
                 consolidated income statements. Amounts contributed to defined benefit plans during the years
                 ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 were insignificant.

     (m) Income taxes
        The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income tax
        is recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
        carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
        and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
        in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
        tax of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
        enactment date. Valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more
        likely than not that the asset will not be realizable in the foreseeable future.

        Deferred tax is recognized on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, which are presumed to
        be distributed to parent companies, unless there is sufficient evidence that the subsidiaries have
        invested or will invest the undistributed earnings permanently in the domestic jurisdictions or the
        earnings will not be subject to tax upon the subsidiaries’ liquidation. Deferred tax is recognized for
        temporary differences in relation to certain investments in equity method investees, equity securities
        and other investments.

        The Company adopts ASC 740 “Income Taxes” which prescribes a more likely than not threshold
        for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
        taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
        classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and
        penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income
        tax disclosures. The Company did not have significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any
        unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of and for
        the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

        In April 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the
        Accounting for Income Taxes”. ASU 2019-12 simplifies various aspects related to accounting for
        income taxes, removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and
        amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not
        have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

           (n) Government grants
                Government grants, which mainly represent amounts received from central and local governments in
                connection with the Company’s investments in local business districts and contributions to technology
                development, are recognized as income in other income, net or as a reduction of specific costs
                and expenses for which the grants are intended to compensate. Such amounts are recognized in
                the consolidated income statements upon receipt and when all conditions attached to the grants
                are fulfilled. For the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, government grants recorded as
                a reduction of specific costs and expenses were RMB4,532 million, RMB6,028 million and RMB5,889
                million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, government grants
                recorded as other income, net were RMB1,589 million, RMB1,661 million and RMB1,857 million,
                respectively. As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, government grants recorded as other liabilities were
                RMB1,071 million and RMB1,687 million, respectively.

                Government grants related to assets are recognized as a reduction of the carrying amount of the
                related asset when all conditions attached to the grants are fulfilled and are recognized in the
                consolidated income statements as a reduction of related depreciation or amortization expense over
                the estimated useful live of the related asset on a straight-line method.

                In April 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures
                by Business Entities about Government Assistance”, which provides guidance on the disclosure of
                transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting
                model by analogy. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial
                position, results of operations and cash flows.

           (o) Leases
                The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases that transfer substantially
                all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases
                as if there was an acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the
                lease. All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. The Company has no significant finance
                leases.

                The Company recognizes lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance
                sheet for leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in non-current prepayments,
                receivables and other assets (Note 13), and operating lease liabilities are included in current accrued
                expenses, accounts payable and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities (Note 19) on the
                consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are
                initially recognized based on the present value of future lease payments at lease commencement.
                The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease
                commencement and the initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and is recorded net of any lease
                incentives received. As the interest rates implicit in most of the leases are not readily determinable,
                the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at lease
                commencement to determine the present value of the future lease payments. Operating lease
                expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

                The Company elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for leases of certain asset
                classes such as shops and malls and equipment leases. Lease and non-lease components for leases
                of other asset classes are accounted for separately. The Company also elected not to recognize short-
                term leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less.

     (p) Cash and cash equivalents
         The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
         months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily
         represent bank deposits and fixed deposits with original maturities of less than three months.

     (q) Short-term investments
         Short-term investments consist primarily of investments in fixed deposits with original maturities
         between three months and one year and certain investments in wealth management products,
         certificates of deposits, marketable debt securities and other investments that the Company has the
         intention to redeem within one year.

     (r) Accounts receivable
         Accounts receivable represent the amounts that the Company has an unconditional right to
         consideration. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
         uncollectible receivable amounts which is estimated using the approach based on expected losses.
         The allowance for doubtful accounts were RMB4,912 million and RMB6,174 million as of March
         31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts
         considers factors such as historical credit loss experience, age of receivable balances, current market
         conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as an
         assessment of receivables due from specific identifiable counterparties to determine whether these
         receivables are considered at risk or uncollectible. The Company assesses collectibility by pooling
         receivables that have similar risk characteristics and evaluates receivables individually when specific
         receivables no longer share those risk characteristics. For receivables evaluated individually, when
         it is determined that foreclosure is probable or when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty at
         the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or
         sale of collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting
         date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.

     (s) Inventories
         Inventories mainly consist of merchandise available for sale. They are accounted for using the
         weighted average cost method and stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
         value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
         completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

           (t)   Equity securities and other investments
                 Equity securities and other investments represent the Company’s investments in equity securities that
                 are not accounted for under the equity method, as well as other investments which primarily consist
                 of debt investments.

                 (i)    Equity securities
                        Equity securities not accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with
                        unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements, according to ASC
                        321 “Investments — Equity Securities”.

                        The Company elected to record a majority of equity investments in privately held companies
                        using the measurement alternative at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for
                        observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments
                        of the same issuer.

                        Equity investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement
                        alternative are subject to periodic impairment reviews. The Company’s impairment analysis
                        considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the fair
                        value of these equity securities, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
                        and Russia-Ukraine conflict.

                        In computing realized gains and losses on equity securities, the Company determines cost based
                        on amounts paid using the average cost method. Dividend income is recognized when the right
                        to receive the payment is established.

                 (ii)   Debt investments
                        Debt investments consist of investments in debt securities and loan investments which are
                        accounted for at amortized cost or under the fair value option, which the Company has elected
                        for certain investments including convertible and exchangeable bonds subscribed. The fair
                        value option permits the irrevocable election on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial
                        recognition or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument. The
                        investments accounted for under the fair value option are carried at fair value with unrealized
                        gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements. Interest income from debt
                        investments is recognized using the effective interest method which is reviewed and adjusted
                        periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows. Debt investments also include other
                        treasury investments which consist of investments in fixed deposits and certificates of deposits
                        with original maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The remaining maturities of these
                        treasury investments held by the Company generally range from one to three years.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (u) Investments in equity method investees
         The Company applies the equity method to account for equity investments in common stock or in-
         substance common stock, according to ASC 323 “Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures”,
         over which it has significant influence but does not own a controlling financial interest, unless the fair
         value option is elected for an investment.

         An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward
         characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity’s common stock. The Company considers
         subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining
         whether an investment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity’s common
         stock.

         Under the equity method, the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the
         equity method investee is recognized in the consolidated income statements and its share of
         post-acquisition movements in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in other
         comprehensive income. The Company records its share of the results of the equity method investees
         on a one quarter in arrears basis. The excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the
         underlying equity in net assets of the equity method investee generally represents goodwill and
         intangible assets acquired. When the Company’s share of losses of the equity method investee equals
         or exceeds its interest in the equity method investee, the Company does not recognize further losses,
         unless the Company has incurred obligations or made payments or guarantees on behalf of the
         equity method investee.

         The Company continually reviews its investments in equity method investees to determine whether
         a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The primary factors the
         Company considers in its determination include the severity and the length of time that the fair value
         of the investment is below its carrying value; the financial condition, the operating performance and
         the prospects of the equity method investee; the geographic region, market and industry in which the
         equity method investee operates, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
         and Russia-Ukraine conflict; and other company specific information such as recent financing rounds
         completed by the equity method investee. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-
         temporary, the carrying value of the investment in the equity method investee is written down to its
         fair value.

     (v) Property and equipment, net
         Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
         loss. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with no residual value based on the
         estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range as follows:

         Computer equipment and software             3–5 years

         Furniture, office and transportation
          equipment and others                       3–10 years

         Buildings and other property                10–50 years

         Property improvements                       shorter of remaining lease period or estimated useful life




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report     309

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (v) Property and equipment, net (Continued)
                Construction in progress represents buildings and related premises under construction, which is
                stated at actual construction cost less any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to
                the respective category of property and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use.

                Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and asset improvements are capitalized.
                The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of or retired are removed from the
                accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated income statements.

           (w) Intangible assets other than licensed copyrights
                Intangible assets mainly include those acquired through business combinations and purchased
                intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recognized as
                assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion.
                Intangible assets arising from business combinations are measured at fair value upon acquisition
                using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and ratio analysis with reference to
                comparable companies in similar industries under the income approach, market approach and cost
                approach. Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangible assets include
                future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Purchased intangible assets are initially
                recognized and measured at cost upon acquisition. Separately identifiable intangible assets that
                have determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-
                line method as follows:

                User base and customer relationships              3–16 years

                Trade names, trademarks and domain names          5–20 years

                Developed technology and patents                  2–7 years

                Non-compete agreements                            over the contracted term of up to 10 years

           (x) Licensed copyrights
                Licensed copyrights related to titles to movies, television series, variety shows, animations and other
                video content acquired from external parties are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or fair
                value. The amortization period for the licensed content vary depending on the type of content, which
                typically ranges from six months to ten years. Licensed copyrights are presented on the consolidated
                balance sheets as current assets under prepayments, receivables and other assets, or non-current
                assets under intangible assets, net, based on estimated time of usage. Licensed copyrights are
                generally amortized using an accelerated method based on historical viewership consumption
                patterns. Estimates of the consumption patterns for licensed copyrights are reviewed periodically and
                revised if necessary. For the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, amortization expenses in
                connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB9,093 million, RMB8,610 million and RMB8,446 million
                were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s Digital media and entertainment segment.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (x) Licensed copyrights (Continued)
         On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates the program usefulness of licensed copyrights pursuant
         to the guidance in ASC 920 “Entertainment — Broadcasters”, which provides that the rights be
         reported at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. When there is a change in the expected usage
         of licensed copyrights, the Company estimates the fair value of licensed copyrights to determine if
         any impairment exists. The fair value of licensed copyrights is determined by estimating the expected
         cash flows from advertising and membership fees, less any costs and expenses, over the remaining
         useful lives of the licensed copyrights at the film-group level. Estimates that impact these cash flows
         include anticipated levels of demand for the Company’s advertising services and the expected selling
         prices of advertisements. For the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, impairment charges in
         connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB1,688 million, RMB745 million and RMB1,133 million
         were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s Digital media and entertainment segment.

     (y) Goodwill
         Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition date amounts of
         the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired
         entity as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries. Goodwill is not
         amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
         in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company
         may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative
         goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers factors such as
         macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the
         reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations, business plans and strategies
         of the reporting unit, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the
         qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
         the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. The Company may also bypass
         the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to perform the quantitative impairment test.

         The Company performs the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of each
         reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds
         its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting
         unit exceeds its fair value, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair
         value is recognized as impairment. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant
         management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, allocation of assets, liabilities
         and goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.

     (z) Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and licensed copyrights
         The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
         indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
         be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future
         undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the assets are considered to be
         impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
         assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and
         licensed copyrights recognized for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was nil, RMB973
         million and RMB1,922 million, respectively.

           (aa) Derivatives and hedging
                All contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are recognized on the consolidated balance
                sheets as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
                are either recognized periodically in the consolidated income statements or in other comprehensive
                income depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting and
                are so designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.

                To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented
                at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which
                includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge
                effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be effective in accomplishing the objective of
                offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of
                the hedging relationship is evaluated on a prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and
                quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms
                of the derivative to those of the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the
                changes in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to that of the hedged
                item. A hedging relationship is considered initially effective if the results of the hedging instrument
                are within a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.

                Interest rate swaps
                Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the cash flows attributable
                to recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted payments may qualify as cash flow hedges. The
                Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap floating interest payments related to
                certain borrowings for fixed interest payments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain
                forecasted payments and obligations. All changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are
                designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
                income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the
                same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

                The Company has elected the optional expedients under ASC 848 “Reference Rate Reform” for certain
                existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges in the hedging relationship
                designation and the assessment of probability of forecasted transaction and hedge effectiveness.

           (ab) Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes
                Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes are recognized initially at fair value, net of upfront
                fees, debt discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees. Upfront fees, debt
                discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees are recorded as a reduction of
                the proceeds received and the related accretion is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated
                income statements over the estimated term of the facilities using the effective interest method.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (ac) Merchant deposits
         The Company collects deposits representing an annual upfront service fee from merchants on Tmall
         and AliExpress before the beginning of each calendar year. These deposits are initially recorded as
         a liability by the Company. The deposits are refundable to a merchant if the level of sales volume
         that is generated by that merchant on Tmall or AliExpress meets the target during the period. If the
         transaction volume target is not met at the end of each calendar year, the relevant deposits will
         become non-refundable. These merchant deposits are accounted for as variable consideration at an
         amount that is estimated at contract inception. The estimate is updated at the end of each reporting
         period and when there are changes in circumstances during the reporting period. Merchant deposits
         are recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statements when the likelihood of refund to
         the merchant is considered remote based on the patterns of sales volume generated by the merchant
         during the reporting period.

     (ad) Deferred revenue and customer advances
         Deferred revenue and customer advances generally represent cash received from customers
         that relate to goods or services to be provided in the future. Deferred revenue, mainly relating to
         membership fees and cloud services revenue, is stated at the amount of service fees received less the
         amount previously recognized as revenue upon the provision of the respective services to customers.

     (ae) Commitments and contingencies
         In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings
         and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for the
         contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
         the liability can be reasonably estimated.

         Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which
         may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events
         occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses these contingent liabilities, which inherently involves
         judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the
         Company or unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, the Company, in consultation
         with its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims
         as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If
         the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred
         and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the
         consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
         contingency is not probable, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent
         liability, together with an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible loss, if determinable and
         material, would be disclosed.

         Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in
         which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (af) Treasury shares
                The Company accounts for treasury shares using the cost method. Under this method, the cost
                incurred to purchase the shares is recorded in the treasury shares account on the consolidated
                balance sheets. At retirement of the treasury shares, the ordinary shares account is charged only for
                the aggregate par value of the shares. The excess of the acquisition cost of treasury shares over the
                aggregate par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.

           (ag) Statutory reserves
                In accordance with the relevant regulations and their articles of association, subsidiaries of the
                Company incorporated in the PRC are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profit
                determined based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations to the general reserve until
                the reserve has reached 50% of the relevant subsidiary’s registered capital. Appropriations to the
                enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the respective
                board of directors of the subsidiaries. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are
                not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. During the years
                ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, appropriations to the general reserve amounted to RMB1,247
                million, RMB2,492 million and RMB3,138 million, respectively. No appropriations to the enterprise
                expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund have been made by the Company.

           (ah) Newly adopted accounting standard updates
                In April 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2020-01, “Investments — Equity Securities (Topic 321),
                Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
                815) — Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a consensus of the
                FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)”, which clarifies the interactions of the accounting for certain equity
                securities under ASC 321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC
                323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under
                ASC 815. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively and the adoption of this guidance did not
                have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

                In April 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, “Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options
                (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):
                Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies
                an issuer’s accounting for certain convertible instruments and the application of derivatives scope
                exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. This guidance also addresses how convertible
                instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and required enhanced
                disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity.
                The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of
                operations and cash flows.

3.   Recent accounting pronouncements
     In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects
     of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and issued subsequent amendments within ASU 2021-
     01 and ASU 2022-06 (collectively, including ASU 2020-04, “ASC 848”) in January 2021 and December 2022
     respectively. ASC 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP on contract
     modifications and hedge accounting to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that
     reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform,
     if certain criteria are met. These optional expedients and exceptions provided in ASC 848 are effective for
     the Company from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company has elected the optional
     expedients for certain existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, which did
     not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company
     is evaluating the effects, if any, of the potential election of the other optional expedients and exceptions
     provided in this guidance on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for
     Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”, which provides guidance on
     the acquirer’s accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The
     amendments require an acquirer recognizes and measures contract assets and contract liabilities acquired
     in a business combination at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated
     the contracts. This guidance also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing
     and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business
     combination. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring
     on or after the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31,
     2024 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The
     Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial
     position, results of operations and cash flows.

     In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement
     of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”, which clarifies that a contractual restriction
     on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and,
     therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot,
     as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also
     requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance
     is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments
     recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company
     for the year ending March 31, 2025 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2025.
     Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a
     material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic
     405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations”, which require a buyer in a supplier
     finance program disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the supplier finance program.
     The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation
     of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. The new guidance is required to be applied
     retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the amendment on
     rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. This guidance is effective for the Company
     for the year ending March 31, 2024 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2024.
     Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a
     material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

      4.   Significant mergers and acquisitions and investments

           Mergers and acquisitions
           (a) Acquisition of Sun Art Retail Group Limited (“Sun Art”)
                Sun Art, a company that is listed on the HKSE, is a leading hypermarket operator in the PRC.
                The Company previously held an approximately 31% effective equity interest in Sun Art and the
                investment in Sun Art was previously accounted for under the equity method. New Retail Strategic
                Opportunities Fund, L.P. (the “Offshore Retail Fund”), an investment fund for which the Company is
                able to exercise significant influence over its investment decisions, is also an existing shareholder in
                Sun Art.

                In October 2020, the Company acquired additional effective equity interest in Sun Art for a cash
                consideration of US$3.6 billion (RMB24.1 billion). Upon the completion of the transaction, the
                Company’s effective equity interest in Sun Art increased to approximately 67% and Sun Art became a
                consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

                The allocation of the purchase price as of the date of acquisition is summarized as follows:

                                                                                                                                 Amounts

                      acquisition date.

     Mergers and acquisitions (Continued)
     (a) Acquisition of Sun Art Retail Group Limited (“Sun Art”) (Continued)
         A gain of RMB6,381 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
         recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
         ended March 31, 2021. The fair value of the previously held equity interests was estimated with
         reference to the market price per share as of the acquisition date.

         As reported in Sun Art’s 2020/2021 annual report, revenue and net income for the 15 months ended
         March 31, 2021 were RMB124.3 billion and RMB3.8 billion, respectively. Revenue and net income for
         the year ended December 2019 were RMB95.4 billion and RMB3.0 billion, respectively.

         The acquisition of Sun Art demonstrates the Company’s continued commitment to Sun Art as well
         as to further update its digital commerce infrastructure by further integrating online and offline
         resources in the PRC’s retail sector. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the
         synergies expected from the combined operations of Sun Art and the Company, the assembled
         workforce and their knowledge and experience in the retail sector in the PRC. The Company did not
         expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

         In December 2020, the Company acquired additional ordinary shares of Sun Art from public
         shareholders for a cash consideration of HK$4.9 billion (RMB4.1 billion) through a mandatory general
         offer as required under the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which resulted in a reduction
         in noncontrolling interests amounting to RMB4,592 million. Upon the completion of the mandatory
         general offer, the Company’s effective equity interest in Sun Art further increased to approximately
         74%.

           agreement is measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated

           increased to 25% and the investment in STO Express is accounted for under the equity method (Note

           consideration of RMB6.7 billion at any time on or before December 27, 2022.

                YTO Express, a company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is one of the leading express
                delivery services companies in the PRC. The Company previously held an approximately 11% equity
                interest in YTO Express and carried the investment at fair value with unrealized gains and losses

     (h) Investment in Ant Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”)
         Ant Group provides comprehensive digital payment services and facilitates digital financial and
         value-added services for consumers and merchants, in China and across the world. In September
         2019, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions, the Company received the 33% equity
         interest in Ant Group pursuant to the share and asset purchase agreement as amended from time to
         time (the “SAPA”).

         The Company accounts for its equity interest in Ant Group under the equity method. Upon the
         completion, the Company recorded the 33% equity interest in Ant Group with a carrying value
         amounting to RMB90.7 billion in investments in equity method investees. The difference between
         the carrying value of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the Company’s share of the carrying
         value of Ant Group’s net assets upon completion is a basis difference, which mainly represents the
         fair value adjustments of amortizable intangible assets and equity investments. These adjustments
         amounted to RMB24.5 billion and RMB5.3 billion, respectively, both of which were net of their
         corresponding tax effects.

         Subsequent to the receipt of the equity interest in Ant Group, the proportionate share of results of
         Ant Group, adjusted for the effects of the basis difference as described above, is recorded in share
         of results of equity method investees in the consolidated income statements on a one quarter in
         arrears basis. Following the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group, the Company has pre-emptive
         rights to participate in other issuances of equity securities by Ant Group and certain of its affiliates
         prior to the time of Ant Group meeting certain minimum criteria for a qualified IPO set forth in the
         SAPA. These pre-emptive rights entitle the Company to maintain the equity ownership percentage the
         Company holds in Ant Group immediately prior to any such issuances. In connection with the exercise
         of the pre-emptive rights, the Company is also entitled to receive certain payments from Ant Group,
         effectively funding the subscription for these additional equity interest, up to a value of US$1.5 billion,
         subject to certain adjustments. In addition, under the SAPA, in certain circumstances the Company
         is permitted to exercise pre-emptive rights through an alternative arrangement which will further
         protect the Company from dilution.

         In July 2023, the Company received notice from Ant Group of a shareholder meeting to approve,
         among other things, a proposal to repurchase from all of its shareholders up to 7.6% of its equity
         interest. The shares repurchased would be transferred to employee incentive plans of Ant Group.
         These transactions were not completed as of the date of this annual report.

      6.   Leases
           The Company entered into operating lease agreements primarily for shops and malls, offices, warehouses
           and land. Certain lease agreements contain an option for the Company to renew a lease for a term of up to
           five years or an option to terminate a lease early. The Company considers these options in determining the
           classification and measurement of the leases.

           The leases may include variable payments based on measures such as the level of sales at a physical store,
           which are expensed as incurred.

           Components of operating lease cost are as follows:

                                                                                 Year ended March 31,
                                                                              2021              2022            2023

                                                                                       (in millions)
            Operating lease cost                                             6,812           10,982          10,802
            Variable lease cost                                                 47               837             672
            Total operating lease cost                                       6,859           11,819          11,474


           For the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, cash payments for operating leases amounted to
           RMB4,408 million, RMB6,556 million and RMB8,050 million, respectively. For the years ended March 31,
           2022 and 2023, the operating lease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities amounted to
           RMB7,375 million and RMB5,030 million, respectively.

           As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease
           term of 9.9 years and 9.3 years, respectively. As of the same dates, the Company’s operating leases had
           a weighted average discount rate of 5.1% and 4.8%, respectively. Future lease payments under operating
           leases as of March 31, 2023 are as follows:

                                                                                                           Amounts

     Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital
     gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands
     withholding tax is imposed. The Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to the
     Hong Kong profits tax rate at 16.5% for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Company’s
     subsidiaries incorporated in other jurisdictions were subject to income tax charges calculated according to
     the tax laws enacted or substantially enacted in the countries where they operate and generate income.

     Current income tax expense primarily includes the provision for PRC Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) for
     subsidiaries operating in the PRC and withholding tax on earnings that have been declared for distribution
     by PRC subsidiaries to offshore holding companies. Substantially all of the Company’s income before
     income tax and share of results of equity method investees are generated by these PRC subsidiaries. These
     subsidiaries are subject to EIT on their taxable income as reported in their respective statutory financial
     statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and regulations in the PRC.

     Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for
     domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for,
     among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology
     Enterprises. Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as Software Enterprises and thereby entitled
     to full exemption from EIT for two years beginning from their first profitable calendar year and a 50%
     reduction for the subsequent three calendar years. In addition, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise
     (“KSE”) within China’s national plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The KSE status is subject to
     review by the relevant authorities every year and the timing of the annual review and notification by the
     relevant authorities may vary from year to year. The related reduction in tax expense as a result of official
     notification confirming the KSE status is accounted for upon the receipt of such notification.

     The tax status of the subsidiaries of the Company with major taxable profits is described below:

     •      Alibaba (China) Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alibaba China”), Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd. (“Taobao
            China”), Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tmall China”) and Alibaba (China) Co., Ltd (“China
            Co.”), entities primarily engaged in the operations of the Company’s wholesale marketplaces,
            Taobao, Tmall, and technology, software research and development and relevant services,
            respectively, were qualified as High and New Technology Enterprises. Alibaba China, Taobao China
            and Tmall China also obtained the annual review and notification relating to the renewal of the KSE
            status for the taxation year of 2019 in the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Accordingly, Alibaba
            China, Taobao China and Tmall China, which had applied an EIT rate of 15% for the taxation year
            of 2019, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation year of 2019 in the consolidated
            income statements for the year ended March 31, 2021.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report   325

           Composition of income tax expenses (Continued)
           •    Alibaba (Beijing) Software Services Co., Ltd (“Alibaba Beijing”), an entity primarily engaged in the
                operations of technology, software research and development and relevant services, was recognized
                as a High and New Technology Enterprise. Alibaba Beijing was also granted the Software Enterprise
                status and was thereby entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning from its first
                profitable taxation year of 2017, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three consecutive years
                starting from the taxation year of 2019. Accordingly, Alibaba Beijing was entitled to an EIT rate of
                12.5% (50% reduction in the standard statutory rate) during the taxation years of 2019, 2020 and
                2021. Alibaba Beijing also obtained notification of recognition as a KSE for the taxation year of 2019
                in the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Accordingly, Alibaba Beijing, which had applied an EIT rate
                of 12.5% for the taxation year of 2019, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation year
                of 2019 in the consolidated income statement for the year ended March 31, 2021.

           The total tax adjustments for the recognition of KSE status for Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China,
           Alibaba Beijing and certain other PRC subsidiaries of the Company, amounting to RMB6,085 million, nil and
           nil, were recorded in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and
           2023, respectively.

           For the taxation years of 2020, 2021 and 2022, Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China, China Co. and
           Alibaba Beijing did not obtain the KSE status, and accordingly, Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China
           and China Co. continued to apply an EIT rate of 15% as High and New Technology Enterprises. Alibaba
           Beijing applied an EIT rate of 12.5% (50% reduction in the standard statutory rate) as a Software Enterprise
           for the taxation years of 2020 and 2021 and applied an EIT rate of 15% as High and New Technology
           Enterprise for the taxation year of 2022.

           Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31,
           2021, 2022 and 2023.

           Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to
           their foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with
           at least 25% equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the relevant
           requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between Chinese mainland and Hong Kong S.A.R. Since
           the equity holders of the major PRC subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies
           and meet the relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between Chinese mainland and
           Hong Kong S.A.R., the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings
           which are anticipated to be distributed. As of March 31, 2023, the Company has accrued the withholding
           tax on substantially all of the distributable earnings of the PRC subsidiaries, except for those undistributed
           earnings that the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB233.6 billion.

8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

     (a) Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
         Share options (Continued)
         No share options were granted during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2023. The fair value of
         each option granted during the year ended March 31, 2022 is estimated on the measurement date
         using the Black-Scholes model by applying the assumptions below:

                                                                                                                        Year ended
                                                                                                                         March 31,
                                                                                                                                2022
          Risk-free interest rate (i)                                                                                 1.93%-2.00%
          Expected dividend yield (ii)                                                                                             0%
          Expected life (years) (iii)                                                                                      3.71-7.14
          Expected volatility (iv)                                                                                             35.7%

         (i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
             life of the share options in effect on the measurement date.
         (ii) Expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its
              ordinary shares.
         (iii) Expected life of share options is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise of share options.
         (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company in the period equal to the expected life
              of each grant.

         As of March 31, 2023, there were RMB283 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
         outstanding share options, net of expected forfeitures. These amounts are expected to be recognized
         over a weighted average period of 3.2 years.

         During the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company recognized share-based
         compensation expense of RMB159 million, RMB86 million and RMB490 million, respectively, in
         connection with the above share options.

     (b) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group
         The employees of the Company hold share-based awards granted by Ant Group and Hangzhou
         Junhan Equity Investment Partnership (“Junhan”), a major equity holder of Ant Group. These awards
         tied to the valuation of Ant Group and will be settled by respective grantors upon disposal of these
         awards by the holders, vesting or exercise of these awards, depending on the forms of these awards.
         In addition, Junhan and Ant Group have the right to repurchase the vested awards (or any underlying
         equity for the settlement of the vested awards) granted by them, as applicable, from the holders
         upon an initial public offering of Ant Group or the termination of the holders’ employment with the
         Company at a price to be determined based on the then fair market value of Ant Group.

         For accounting purposes, these awards meet the definition of a financial derivative. The cost
         relating to these awards is recognized by the Company and the related expense is recognized over
         the requisite service period in the consolidated income statements with a corresponding credit to
         additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these awards are recorded in the
         consolidated income statements. The expenses relating to these awards are re-measured at the fair
         value on each reporting date until their settlement dates. The fair value of the underlying equity is
         primarily determined with reference to the business enterprise value, or BEV, of Ant Group which is
         based on the contemporaneous valuation report, external information and information obtained from
         Ant Group.



                                                                                                 Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report            331

      8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

           (b) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group (Continued)
                During the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company recognized expenses of
                RMB17,315 million, a net reversal of RMB11,585 million and expenses of RMB668 million, respectively,
                in respect of the share-based awards relating to Ant Group.

                Starting from April 2020, the parties agreed to settle with each other the cost associated with certain
                share-based awards granted to each other’s employees upon vesting. The settlement amounts under
                this arrangement depend on the values of Ant Group share-based awards granted to the Company’s
                employees and the Company’s share-based awards granted to employees of Ant Group, in which the
                net settlement amount is insignificant to the Company.

                Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company and Ant Group are generally subject
                to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the plans. Depending on the
                nature and the purpose of the grant, share-based awards generally vest 25% or 50% upon the first
                or second anniversary of the vesting commencement date, respectively, as provided in the award
                agreements, and 25% every year thereafter. Share-based awards granted to certain management
                members of the Company are subject to a vesting period of up to ten years.

      9.   Earnings per share/ADS
           Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

           Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
           weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, adjusted for treasury shares. Basic earnings per
           ADS is derived from the basic earnings per share.

           For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic
           earnings per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including share-based awards, under the
           treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities, of which the amounts are insignificant, have been
           excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted
           earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per share.

      12. Fair value measurement
           Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
           orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability
           of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to
           measure fair value:

           Level 1         —    Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in
                                active markets.

           Level 2         —    Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1,
                                such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices
                                for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other
                                inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

           Level 3         —    Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions, consistent with
                                reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These
                                valuations require significant judgment.


           Fair value of listed equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
           liabilities. Certain other financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts and certain option
           agreements, are valued based on inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
           Valuations of convertible and exchangeable bonds that do not have a quoted price are generally
           performed using valuation models such as the binomial model with unobservable inputs including
           risk-free interest rate and expected volatility. The valuation of contingent consideration is performed
           using an expected cash flow method with unobservable inputs including the probability to achieve
           the contingencies, which is assessed by the Company, in connection with the contingent consideration
           arrangements. Investments in privately held companies for which the Company elected to record using the
           measurement alternative are re-measured on a non-recurring basis, and are categorized within Level 3
           under the fair value hierarchy. The values are estimated based on valuation methods using the observable
           transaction price at the transaction date and considering the rights and obligations of the securities and
           other unobservable inputs including volatility.

   (i) During the year ended March 31, 2022, considered the changes in market conditions, the Company performed quantitative
       impairment tests on certain reporting units under the Digital media and entertainment segment and recognized impairment
       charges of RMB14,754 million relating to one listed reporting unit and RMB10,387 million relating to one unlisted reporting
       unit. The fair value of the listed reporting unit was determined based on its market capitalization, adjusted for control
       premium. The fair value of the unlisted reporting unit was determined based on the discounted cash flow analysis using the
       assumptions including the future growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital. No further impairment charge was
       recognized relating to these reporting units during the year ended March 31, 2023.
   (ii) During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company allocated its goodwill primarily as a result of the change in segments
        (Note 26).

   Gross goodwill balances were RMB299,201 million and RMB300,425 million as of March 31, 2022 and 2023,
   respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were RMB29,620 million and RMB32,334 million as of March
   31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

   In the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts
   of certain reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and recorded impairment losses of
   nil, RMB25,141 million and RMB2,714 million during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023,
   respectively.

   The goodwill impairment is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information (Note 26)
   because the CODM of the Company does not consider this as part of the segment operating performance
   measure.

      18. Deferred revenue and customer advances
           Deferred revenue and customer advances primarily represent service fees prepaid by merchants or
           customers for which the relevant services have not been provided. The respective balances are as follows:

                                                                                             As of March 31,

                                                                                            70,473             74,855
            Less: current portion                                                           (66,983)           (71,295)
            Non-current portion                                                               3,490             3,560


           All service fees received in advance are initially recorded as customer advances. These amounts are
           transferred to deferred revenue upon commencement of the provision of services by the Company and
           are recognized in the consolidated income statements in the period in which the services are provided. In
           general, service fees received in advance are non-refundable after the amounts are transferred to deferred
           revenue. Substantially all of the balances of deferred revenue and customer advances are generally
           recognized as revenue within one year.

           Bank borrowings are analyzed as follows:

           (i) As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company had short-term borrowings from banks which were repayable within one
               year or on demand and charged interest rates ranging from 0.6% to 12.5% and 1.6% to 12.5% per annum, respectively.
               As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, the weighted average interest rate of these borrowings was 2.8% and 2.7% per annum,
               respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB.

                floating interest payments are hedged by certain interest rate swap contracts entered into by the Company. The proceeds of
                the loan were used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions). In May 2023, the loan terms
                were modified such that the interest rate of the loan was adjusted to 80 basis points over Secured Overnight Financing Rate
                (“SOFR”) with a credit adjustment spread and the maturity of the loan was extended to May 2028 in July 2023.
           (iii) As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company had long-term borrowings from banks with weighted average interest rates of
                 4.1% and 3.8% per annum, respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB.

           Certain other bank borrowings are collateralized by a pledge of certain buildings and property
           improvements, construction in progress and land use rights in the PRC with carrying values of RMB19,617
           million and RMB23,767 million, as of March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, the
           Company is in compliance with all covenants in relation to bank borrowings.

           In April 2017, the Company obtained a revolving credit facility provided by certain financial institutions for
           an amount of US$5.15 billion, which has not yet been drawn down. The interest rate on any outstanding
           utilized amount under this credit facility was calculated based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. This facility
           is reserved for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions). In June 2021,
           the terms of this credit facility were amended and the amount of the credit facility was increased to
           US$6.5 billion. The expiration date of the credit facility was extended to June 2026. Under the terms of the
           amended credit facility, the interest rate on any outstanding utilized amount will be calculated based on
           LIBOR plus 80 basis points. In May 2023, the interest rate was adjusted to SOFR with a credit adjustment
           spread plus 80 basis points.

           with the Company’s investments. As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, the aggregate outstanding balance of
           these loans was RMB3,000 million and RMB2,345 million, respectively, with remaining terms of up to four
           years and interest rates of up to 10% per annum as of March 31, 2022, and remaining terms of up to three
           years and interest rates of up to 10% per annum as of March 31, 2023.

           The Company provided a guarantee for a term loan facility of HK$7.7 billion in favor of Hong Kong Cingleot
           Investment Management Limited (“Cingleot”), a company that is partially owned by the Company, in
           connection with a logistics center development project at the Hong Kong International Airport. As of March
           31, 2022 and 2023, HK$3,413 million and HK$5,233 million was drawn down by Cingleot under this facility,
           respectively.

22. Related party transactions (Continued)

    Transactions with other investees (Continued)
    The Company’s ecosystem offers different platforms on which different enterprises operate and the
    Company believes that all transactions on the Company’s platforms are conducted on terms obtained in
    arm’s length transactions with similar unrelated parties.

    Other than the transactions disclosed above or elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company has commercial arrangements with SoftBank, other investees and other related parties to
    provide and receive certain marketing, cloud and other services and products. The amounts relating to
    these services provided and received represent less than 1% of the Company’s revenue and total costs and
    expenses, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

    In addition, the Company has made certain acquisitions and equity investments together with related
    parties from time to time during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The agreements for
    acquisitions and equity investments were entered into by the parties involved and conducted on fair value
    basis. The significant acquisitions and equity investments together with related parties are included in
    Note 4.

23. Restricted net assets
    PRC laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the
    PRC only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards
    and regulations. In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are required to annually
    appropriate 10% of their net income to the statutory reserve prior to payment of any dividends, unless the
    reserve has reached 50% of their respective registered capital. Furthermore, registered share capital and
    capital reserve accounts are also restricted from distribution. As a result of the restrictions described above
    and elsewhere under PRC laws and regulations, the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are
    restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company in the form of dividends.
    The restriction amounted to RMB194,576 million as of March 31, 2023. Except for the above or disclosed
    elsewhere, there is no other restriction on the use of proceeds generated by the Company’s subsidiaries to
    satisfy any obligations of the Company.

      24. Commitments

           (a) Capital commitments
                The Company’s capital commitments primarily relate to capital expenditures contracted for purchase
                of property and equipment, including the construction of corporate campuses. Total capital
                commitments contracted but not provided for amounted to RMB39,272 million and RMB21,924 million
                as of March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The capital expenditures contracted for are analyzed as
                follows:

                                                                                            As of March 31,
                                                                                              2022             2023
                                                                                              RMB               RMB
                                                                                              (in millions)
                 No later than 1 year                                                       25,438            16,826
                 Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years                                13,781             5,092
                 More than 5 years                                                              53                6
                                                                                            39,272            21,924


           (b) Investment commitments
                The Company was obligated to pay up to RMB12,456 million and RMB11,570 million for business
                combinations and equity investments under various arrangements as of March 31, 2022 and
                2023, respectively. The commitment balance as of March 31, 2022 and 2023 primarily includes the
                remaining committed capital of certain investment funds.

           (c) Other commitments
                The Company also has other commitments including commitments for co-location and bandwidth
                fees, licensed copyrights and marketing expenses. These commitments are analyzed as follows:

                                                                                            As of March 31,
                                                                                              2022             2023
                                                                                              RMB               RMB
                                                                                              (in millions)
                 No later than 1 year                                                       37,229            37,210
                 Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years                                17,347            21,288
                 More than 5 years                                                           2,446             3,559
                                                                                            57,022            62,057

24. Commitments (Continued)

   (c) Other commitments (Continued)
         As a marketing initiative, the Company entered into a framework agreement with the International
         Olympic Committee (the “IOC”) and the United States Olympic Committee in January 2017 for a long-
         term partnership arrangement through 2028. Joining in The Olympic Partner worldwide sponsorship
         program, the Company has become the official “E-Commerce Services” Partner and “Cloud Services”
         Partner of the IOC. In addition, the Company has been granted certain marketing rights, benefits
         and opportunities relating to future Olympic Games and related initiatives, events and activities. The
         Company committed to provide at least US$815 million worth of cash, cloud infrastructure services
         and cloud computing services, as well as marketing and media support in connection with various
         Olympic initiatives, events and activities, including the Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games
         through 2028.

25. Risks and contingencies
   (a)   The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and considered as a foreign entity under PRC
         laws. Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
         added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
         the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses through various contractual
         arrangements with VIEs that are incorporated and owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned
         and/or controlled by PRC citizens. The VIEs hold the licenses and approvals that are essential for
         their business operations in the PRC and the Company has entered into various agreements with the
         VIEs and their equity holders such that the Company has the right to benefit from their licenses and
         approvals and generally has control of the VIEs. In the Company’s opinion, the current ownership
         structure and the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders as well as the
         operations of the VIEs are in substantial compliance with all existing PRC laws, rules and regulations.
         However, there may be changes and other developments in PRC laws, rules and regulations.
         Accordingly, the Company gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view
         in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of
         the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found
         to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct
         its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership
         structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in
         deconsolidation of the VIEs.

   (b)   The PRC market in which the Company operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks
         and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of the Company to operate or invest
         in online and mobile commerce or other Internet related businesses, representing the principal
         services provided by the Company, in the PRC. The information and technology industries are highly
         regulated. Restrictions are currently in place or are unclear regarding what specific segments of
         these industries foreign owned enterprises, like the Company, may operate. If new or more extensive
         restrictions were imposed on the segments in which the Company is permitted to operate, the
         Company could be required to sell or cease to operate or invest in some or all of its current businesses
         in the PRC. These uncertainties also extend to the PRC’s regulations relating to anti-monopoly and
         anti-unfair competition. In December 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation of the
         PRC (the “SAMR”) commenced an investigation on the Company pursuant to the PRC Anti-monopoly
         Law. Following the investigation, in April 2021, the SAMR issued an administrative penalty decision
         of the anti-monopoly investigation into the Company and imposed a fine of RMB18.2 billion, which
         was accrued for as of March 31, 2021. The amount has been paid as of March 31, 2022. The SAMR
         also issued an administrative guidance, instructing the Company to implement a comprehensive
         rectification program, and to file a self-assessment and compliance report to the SAMR for three
         consecutive years.

                                                                                 Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report     353
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      For the Years Ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023



      25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
           (c)   Because of the Company’s equity interest in and close association with Ant Group and overlapping
                 user bases, regulatory developments, litigation or proceedings, media and other reports, whether or
                 not true, and other events that affect Ant Group could also negatively affect customers’, regulators’,
                 investors’ and other third parties’ perception of the Company. In April 2021, Ant Group announced
                 that it would apply to set up a financial holding company to ensure its financial-related businesses
                 are fully regulated. To implement the rectification plan and comply with applicable new measures
                 and rules, Ant Group may be required to spend significant time and resources and make changes
                 to its businesses, which could materially and adversely affect its business operations and growth
                 prospects. In July 2023, PRC regulators announced a RMB7.07 billion fine for Ant Group and Ant Group
                 has completed the related work on the rectification. Changes in Ant Group’s business and future
                 prospects, or speculation of such changes, as well as additional regulatory requirements placed on
                 Ant Group, could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company.

           (d)   The Company’s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a
                 significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely
                 convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to
                 be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People’s Bank of
                 China (the “PBOC”).

                 Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in the PRC must be processed through the
                 PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory bodies and require certain supporting documentation
                 in order to effect the remittance. If the foreign exchange control system prevents the Company from
                 obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able
                 to pay dividends in foreign currencies and the Company’s ability to fund its business activities that are
                 conducted in foreign currencies could be adversely affected.

           (e)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes strategic investments to increase the service
                 offerings and expand capabilities. The Company continually reviews its investments to determine
                 whether there is a decline in fair value below the carrying value. Fair value of the listed securities is
                 subject to volatility and may be materially affected by market fluctuations.

           (f)   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk
                 consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and equity
                 securities and other investments. As of March 31, 2022 and 2023, substantially all of the Company’s
                 cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and other treasury investments
                 were held by major financial institutions located worldwide, including Chinese mainland and Hong
                 Kong S.A.R. If the financial institutions and other issuers of financial instruments held by the Company
                 could become insolvent or if the markets for these instruments could become illiquid as a result of a
                 severe economic downturn, the Company could lose some or all of the value of its investments.

           (g)   During the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company offered a trade assurance
                 program on the international wholesale marketplaces at no charge to the wholesale buyers and
                 sellers. If the wholesale sellers who participate in this program do not deliver the products in their
                 stated specifications to the wholesale buyers on schedule, the Company may compensate the
                 wholesale buyers for their losses on behalf of the wholesale sellers up to a pre-determined amount
                 following a review of each particular case. In turn, the Company will seek a full reimbursement
                 from the wholesale sellers for the prepaid reimbursement amount, yet the Company is exposed
                 to a risk over the collectability of the reimbursement from the wholesale sellers. During the years
                 ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company did not incur any material losses with respect
                 to the compensation provided under this program. Given that the maximum compensation for each
                 wholesale seller is pre-determined based on their individual risk assessments by the Company
                 considering their credit profile or other relevant information, the Company determined that the
                 likelihood of material default on the payments are not probable and therefore no provisions have
                 been made in relation to this program.

25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (h)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
         and litigations in relation to disputes relating to trademarks and other intellectual property, among
         others. In 2017, Beijing Jingdong Shiji Trading Co., Ltd. and Beijing Jingdong 360 E-commerce Co., Ltd.
         sued Tmall China, Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Limited for abuse of
         dominant market position. The plaintiffs requested the three defendants to cease relevant acts and
         claimed a substantial amount of damages in the original complaint. In March 2021, the plaintiffs
         amended their claim to seek higher damages. The case is pending in Beijing High People’s Court
         and the potential damages are not reasonably estimable at the current stage. There are no legal
         proceedings and litigations that have in the recent past had, or to the Company’s knowledge, are
         probable to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial positions, results of operations or
         cash flows. The Company did not accrue any material loss contingencies in this respect as of March
         31, 2022 and 2023.

   (i)   The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on
         the global economy in the year ended March 31, 2023, which has adversely affected the Company’s
         business and financial results. From early 2020 to early 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a
         series of lock-downs, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions that significantly and
         negatively affected our various businesses in China, particularly the Company’s China commerce
         and local consumer services businesses. The Company’s key international commerce businesses also
         experienced a negative impact. The COVID-19 pandemic also presented challenges to the Company’s
         business operations as well as the business operations of the Company’s merchants, business
         partners and other participants in the Company’s ecosystem, such as closure of offices and facilities,
         disruptions to or even suspensions of normal business and logistics operations, as well as restrictions
         on travel. Starting in December 2022, China has lifted most of the COVID-19-induced travel restrictions
         and quarantine requirements. From late December 2022 to early 2023, certain parts of China
         experienced COVID-19 resurgence, which caused significant disruption to the Company’s business
         operations in these regions. It is not possible to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
         the Company’s business operations and financial results going forward, which is highly dependent
         on numerous factors, including the frequency, duration and spread of the outbreaks of the COVID-19
         pandemic (including any new variant with different characteristics) in China or elsewhere, actions
         taken by governments, the response of businesses and individuals to the pandemic, the impact
         of the pandemic on business and economic conditions in China and globally, consumer demand,
         the Company’s ability and the ability of merchants, retailers, logistics service providers and other
         participants in the Company’s ecosystem to continue operations in areas affected by the pandemic
         and the Company’s efforts and expenditures to support merchants and partners and ensure the
         safety of the Company’s employees. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect the
         Company’s business and results of operations.

   (j)   The Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in significant disruptions to supply chains, logistics and
         business activities in the region that has negatively affected our international commerce business
         and Cainiao’s international logistics business. The conflict has also caused, and continues to intensify,
         significant geopolitical tensions in Europe and across the globe. The resulting sanctions imposed
         are expected to have significant impacts on the economic conditions of the countries and markets
         targeted by such sanctions, and may have unforeseen, unpredictable secondary effects on global

      26. Segment information
           The Company presents segment information after elimination of inter-company transactions. In general,
           revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses are directly attributable, or are allocated, to each
           segment. The Company allocates costs and expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific
           segment, such as those that support infrastructure across different segments, to different segments mainly
           on the basis of usage, revenue or headcount, depending on the nature of the relevant costs and expenses.
           The Company does not allocate assets to its segments as the CODM does not evaluate the performance of
           segments using asset information.

           The following tables present the summary of each segment’s revenue, income from operations and
           adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Adjusted EBITA”) which is considered as a
           segment operating performance measure, for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:

               was previously reported under the China commerce segment, to the Local consumer services segment in order to conform
               to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance. Figures for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 were
               reclassified to conform to this presentation.
           (ii) Unallocated expenses primarily relate to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated
                to individual segments.

           (iv) Adjusted EBITA margin represents Adjusted EBITA divided by revenue.

           Details of the Company’s revenue by segment are set out in Note 5. As substantially all of the Company’s
           long-lived assets are located in the PRC and substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from
           within the PRC, no geographical information is presented.

           As of March 31, 2023, the Company was in the process of implementing a new organizational and
           governance structure. Following the implementation of the new organizational structure, the segment
           reporting will be updated to reflect the new reporting structure that will be reviewed by the CODM.

                                                                        For the Years Ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023



27. Reconciliation between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
    Standards (Continued)
   (i) Consolidation and business combinations
       The Company consolidates an entity when the Company obtains control over the entity and deconsolidates the entity upon
       the loss of control. Under U.S. GAAP, control generally exists when the Company obtains a controlling financial interest over
       an entity, whereby the usual condition is ownership of over 50% of the voting shares. Under IFRS, de facto control exists
       when the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity, even if the Company owns less than
       50% of the voting shares.
       The Company recognizes noncontrolling interests to reflect the portion of equity of a subsidiary that is not attributable to the
       Company. Under U.S. GAAP, noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value and full goodwill in relation to the acquiree
       is recognized in a business combination. Under IFRS, the Company can elect, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to
       measure noncontrolling interests at the noncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets
       and partial goodwill is recognized to reflect the controlling interests only.
   (ii) Equity securities without readily determinable fair value
       Under U.S. GAAP, the Company can elect, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to apply the measurement alternative to
       record the investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, with subsequent
       adjustments for observable price changes recognized in the consolidated income statements. Under IFRS, these investments
       are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated income statements.
   (iii) Equity method investments
       The Company generally applies the equity method to account for equity investments over which it has significant influence.
       Under U.S. GAAP, significant influence is presumed to exist for an investment in limited partnership or unincorporated entity,
       unless the investment is so minor that the Company has virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial
       policies. Under IFRS, significant influence is presumed to exist for an investment of over 20% of the voting rights of an entity.
       The Company records its share of the post-acquisition results of its equity method investees and adjusts for the basis
       differences that exist between the carrying values of the equity method investments and the Company’s proportionate share
       of the carrying value of the investee’s net assets. Adjustments are made to the financial statements of the equity method
       investees prepared under U.S. GAAP in order to conform to the Company’s accounting policies under IFRS and to reflect the
       basis differences of the equity method investments under IFRS, if different from those under U.S. GAAP.
   (iv) Share-based awards
       The employees of the Company hold share-based awards relating to an equity method investee of the Company that were
       granted and will be settled by related parties or economic interest holders of the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, the cost
       related to these awards is recognized over the requisite service period, with subsequent changes in fair value of these
       awards recognized in the consolidated income statements. Under IFRS, these awards are not considered as share based
       payments of the Company and the cost relating to these awards is not recognized.
       The Company accounts for income tax effects of share based awards that ordinarily give rise to tax deduction. Under U.S.
       GAAP, deferred taxes for these awards are measured based on share-based compensation expenses recognized in the
       consolidated financial statements. Under IFRS, deferred taxes for these awards are measured based on future tax deduction
       estimated at the end of each reporting period.
   (v) Operating leases
       Under U.S. GAAP, the amortization of right-of-use assets and the interest expense related to lease liabilities are recorded
       together as lease expense and recognized in the consolidated income statements on a straight-line basis. Under IFRS,
       the right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis while the interest expense related to lease liabilities are
       recognized in the consolidated income statements using effective interest method.
   (vi) Redeemable noncontrolling interests
       Equity interests issued by certain subsidiaries of the Company are redeemable. Under U.S. GAAP, redeemable equity
       interests are classified as mezzanine equity if the redemption is outside the Company’s control and as noncontrolling
       interests if equity interests issued by finite-lived subsidiaries are mandatorily redeemable only upon liquidation. Under IFRS,
       these redeemable equity interests are generally classified as financial liabilities.
   (vii)Hyperinflation
       Under U.S. GAAP, when the Company determines that a subsidiary is operating in a highly inflationary economy, the
       financial statements of this subsidiary are remeasured prospectively as if its functional currency was the functional currency
       of its immediate parent company. Under IFRS, the financial statements of the subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary
       economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.
