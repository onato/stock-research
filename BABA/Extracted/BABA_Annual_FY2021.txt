                                                                                                                         we defined our mission
     Dear Shareholders,
                                                                                                                         “to make it easy to do business
     This time last year, I thought the world would have reopened and normal travel would have resumed by now. I
                                                                                                                         anywhere.” Over the past 22 years,
     hope that you and your loved ones have stayed safe and healthy over this past year, and discovered silver linings   we have remained committed to
     amidst the challenges. I want to express my appreciation for your continued understanding, support, and trust
     during these exceptional times.
                                                                                                                         taking a long-term approach
                                                                                                                         and investing for the future.
     We went through an unprecedented year. In addition to the complications of the pandemic, there were profound        This has been the
     and lasting shifts in international relations, global economy, and the overall macro environment. Many of these     cornerstone of our
     changes were also new for Alibaba. Luckily, we are well-positioned in the world’s biggest consumption market
     and backed by the world’s most resilient and dynamic supply chain system here in China. Moreover, the economy       development.
     and life in China was among the first to return to normalcy. All these factors have reinforced confidence in our
     long-term growth and value-creation.


     Despite the challenges, we remained focused on our vision and mission, and in transforming adversity into
     opportunity. As of the end of March 2021, global annual active consumers across the Alibaba Ecosystem reached
     1.13 billion, surpassing the historic one billion consumer milestone. Our globalization strategy is making solid
     progress and our overseas active consumers reached 240 million, with Lazada’s swift growth in Southeast Asia,
     rapid expansion of AliExpress in Europe and healthy development of our investee company Trendyol in Turkey.
     Over the past year, our consumers in China and overseas collectively contributed a combined GMV of more than
     RMB8,119 billion (US$1,239 billion). More importantly, we have China’s most diverse consumer base with
     the highest consumption power. Over the past fiscal year, the annual average GMV per consumer on our China
     retail marketplaces exceeded RMB9,200 (US$1,404).


     In 2016, we introduced our New Retail strategy and have been actively experimenting with different retail
     formats over the past few years. We have redefined the shopping experience for consumers online and offline,
     by leveraging our understanding of the industry’s complexities to transform traditional retailers such as
     RT-Mart and incubate new omni-channel retail formats such as Freshippo. We are addressing a wide range of
     consumer needs through a full range of high-frequency fulfillment services that includes one-hour delivery, half-
     day delivery and next-day delivery. In 2020, we introduced our Community Marketplace business that offered
     next-day pickup in select regions. This new retail format will help to further expand our consumer base in less-
     developed and rural areas, and an important channel for serving price-sensitive consumers within our multi-
     dimensional New Retail matrix. The combined capabilities that we have accumulated over the years - product
     and supply chain; fulfillment and delivery; consumer management; and social commerce channel development
     and operations – have made Alibaba well-positioned to build out a healthy and sustainable new business that
     will enrich our New Retail matrix.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rulan Lv embarked on a new career path and started a store on
Taobao Marketplace. The store is a venue for her to deploy her excellent needlecraft, giving birth
to a new profession — “stuffed animal doctor.” She repairs damaged old stuffed animals and
has “cured” over 200 “sick” animals in a year. Just like a real doctor, she keeps medical records
for each stuffed animal. Through cleaning, replenishing stuffing, reshaping and sewing, she
lovingly revitalizes each stuffed animal with needle and thread. Rulan uses her unique skills to
become an entrepreneur on Taobao Marketplace and helped many Taobao Marketplace users
preserve treasured childhood memories.

           Jinye Paper is a wholesale merchant from the traditional industry belt in Hebei Province.
           Guided by the consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) model, the company redesigned its
           production line to manufacture eco-friendly toilet paper rolls and quickly captured market
           share through Taobao Deals. Jinye discovered that Taobao Deals is effective in attracting
           consumers. The robust retail demand and sales on Taobao Deals in turn led wholesalers to
           make bulk purchases on Jinye’s store on 1688.com. Furthermore, Jinye was able to leverage
           Cainiao Network’s fulfillment services to overcome the logistics pain points of many paper
           manufacturers and expand its business to southern China.

           Cainiao Network
           Experienced businesswoman Juan Qiu began selling men’s and women’s underwear on
           AliExpress in 2016. One of her biggest challenges was to address international customer
           inquiries about timing of order deliveries. In 2020, while global logistics was still impacted by the
           COVID-19 pandemic, Cainiao Network launched its “US$5, 10-day delivery” * shipping service
           that reduced delivery time of international parcels to under two weeks. This service improved
           Juan’s global customers’ satisfaction, which in turn has helped Juan’s team to build trust with
           customers. The improved time efficiency has also reduced inventory and cash flow pressures.

           * “US$5, 10-day delivery” means that goods will be delivered within 10 working days from order placement to
           package receipt. Currently, the service coverage includes Spain, France, the Netherlands and Russia, among others,
           and it is expected to cover 20 countries around the world within this year.

           Zengguang Song, a “blue knight” of Ele.me, was the first delivery rider to be awarded the
           “National May 1st Labor Day Medal of Honor” in China and believes this recognition of his
           profession is invaluable as more people join the food delivery industry. Zengguang has now
           transitioned from a frontline rider to a logistics station manager. To contribute to a safer and
           more professional environment for new riders, he has since trained more than 400 riders, not
           only by providing basic knowledge training to new riders but also by sharing his delivery station
           management experience and best practices to improve rider safety.

amid the COVID-19 pandemic
Kopi Kenangan is a coffee shop start-up in Indonesia that adopts Alibaba Cloud’s technology
for digitalization and online-offline integration. Kopi Kenangan moved its mobile app to
Alibaba Cloud’s cloud-based platform to enhance the efficiency of processing peak-time
online orders. It also leverages cloud computing tools to analyze and visually display data.
With the technology support of Alibaba Cloud, Kopi Kenangan’s operation remained smooth
despite a tens of times surge in traffic volume on its app during its third anniversary in August
2020. Notwithstanding the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company
achieved remarkable online business growth in the past year, which demonstrates the
importance of digital strategy for start-ups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kopi Kenangan
started using DingTalk, Alibaba’s digital collaboration workplace for enterprises, to facilitate

For Yahui Sun from Henan, who lost both arms in an accident, livestreaming has become
his tool to overcome his personal adversity. In the past year, he conducted livestreaming
sessions for eight hours every day. His persistence resulted in a fan base in excess of 10,000
followers, and a transformation from being camera-shy to actively engaging with his fans. He
established an agricultural cooperative in his village and has been listing local agricultural
specialties on Taobao Marketplace to help with the village’s economic development. Today,
more than 20 different agricultural specialty products from his store on Taobao Marketplace
are sold to major cities across China, transcending geographical boundaries.

      (1) Beginning on April 1, 2020, we reclassified revenue from our self-developed online games business, which was previously reported
          under the innovation initiatives and others segment, as revenue from digital media and entertainment segment because it has
          moved beyond the incubation stage. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance.
          Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.
      (2) Each ADS represents eight Shares. For the year ended March 31, 2019, earnings per share has been retrospectively adjusted for the

          under the innovation initiatives and others segment, to the digital media and entertainment segment because it has moved
          beyond the incubation stage. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance.
          Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.

      of the preferred shares issued under this plan by the

      Partner Capital Investment Plan
      We adopted the Partner Capital Investment Plan in
      2013 to provide partners of the Alibaba Partnership
      an opportunity to invest in interests in our ordinary
      shares in order to align further their interests with the
      interests of our shareholders. Pursuant to the Partner
      Capital Investment Plan, eligible partners subscribed
      for or will receive rights or interests, issued by two
      special purpose vehicles, to acquire or receive our
      ordinary shares. These rights or interests are subject
      to non-compete provisions, transfer restrictions,
      exercise restrictions and/or vesting schedules, which
      are longer than the vesting schedules under our equity
      incentive plans. Subsequent to the transfer of 5,957,904
      ordinary shares (equivalent to 744,738 ADSs) from the
      Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan discussed
      above, the maximum number of our ordinary shares

      Report of Independent Registered Public
      Accounting Firm




      To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alibaba Group Holding Limited

      Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its
      subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, and the related consolidated income statements,
      consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each
      of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as
      the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial
      reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
      issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
      flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
      in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria
      established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

      Change in Accounting Principle
      As discussed in Note 2(t) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
      accounts for its investments in equity securities for the year ended March 31, 2019.

      Basis for Opinions
      The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
      effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
      over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      appearing under the section of “Controls and Procedures” in the Company’s annual report. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal
      control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
      Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect
      to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
      the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
      and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
      are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
      financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.




268   Alibaba Group Holding Limited
                        Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded Sun Art Retail Group Limited and its subsidiaries (“Sun Art”) from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, because it was acquired by the Company in a business combination
during the year ended March 31, 2021. We have also excluded Sun Art from our audit of internal control over
financial reporting. Sun Art is a subsidiary of the Company whose total assets and total revenues excluded from
management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 7% and
6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31,
2021.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements
and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report    269
      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



      Impairment Assessment on Goodwill Allocated to Reporting Units under the Digital Media and
      Entertainment Segment
      As described in Note 2(y) and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s balance of
      goodwill allocated to reporting units under the Digital Media and Entertainment Segment as of March 31, 2021
      was RMB58,673 million. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events
      or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. The Company has elected to first perform a
      qualitative assessment to determine whether the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is necessary. In the
      qualitative assessment, the Company considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
      considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting units, and other specific information related to
      the operations, business plans and strategies of the reporting units, including consideration of the impact of
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of
      a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. During the year
      ended March 31, 2021, no impairment charge on goodwill was recognized based on the qualitative assessment
      performed.

      The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment
      assessment on goodwill allocated to reporting units under the Digital Media and Entertainment Segment is a
      critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment and estimation by management when performing
      the qualitative assessment, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in
      performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the factors considered in management’s
      qualitative assessment.

      Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
      forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the
      effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessment on goodwill allocated to reporting
      units under the Digital Media and Entertainment Segment, including controls over management’s evaluation
      of the factors considered in the qualitative assessment. These procedures also included, among others, testing
      management’s qualitative assessment, which included evaluating the factors considered by management,
      such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the
      reporting units, and other specific information related to the operations, business plans and strategies of the
      reporting units, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Valuation of Intangible Assets Acquired in Connection with Business Combinations
      As described in Note 2(w) and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded
      RMB20,750 million of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with business combinations during
      the year ended March 31, 2021, which were measured at fair value upon acquisition primarily using valuation
      techniques under the income approach. Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these
      intangible assets include future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital.

      The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of
      intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations is a critical audit matter are that there
      was significant judgment and estimation by management when determining the fair values of these intangible
      assets, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures
      and evaluating audit evidence relating to the valuation techniques and the significant assumptions used
      by management in determining the fair value of these intangible assets, including future growth rates and
      weighted average cost of capital.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the
effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting in connection with business combinations,
including controls over management’s identification of the intangible assets and controls over the development
of the significant assumptions related to the valuation of these intangible assets. These procedures also
included, among others, reading the share purchase agreements and testing the fair values of the intangible
assets acquired in connection with business combinations as determined by management, which included
(i) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques, (ii) testing the completeness, mathematical
accuracy and relevance of the underlying data in management’s cash flow projections adopted in the income
approach, and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions, including future growth rates and weighted average
cost of capital. Evaluating the reasonableness of the future growth rates for the forecast period involved
considering the past performance of the acquired businesses as well as economic and industry forecasts. The
weighted average cost of capital was evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and
other industry factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the
reasonableness of the future growth rate for terminal value and the weighted average cost of capital used by
management.

Fair Value Determination Related to Investments in Privately Held Companies Accounted for Using the
Measurement Alternative
As described in Note 2(t) and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s investments in
privately held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative were RMB96,946 million as of March
31, 2021. The Company recorded these investments at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for
observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same
issuer. The fair value of the investments with observable price changes is determined based on valuation
methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including
volatility, as well as rights and obligations of the securities.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value
determination related to investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement
alternative is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment and estimation by management
when determining the fair value of the investments with observable price changes, which in turn led to a high
degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence
relating to management’s assessment of whether the observable transaction is orderly and whether the
investment involved is similar to the Company’s investment and management’s determination of the fair value
adjustments.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the
effectiveness of controls relating to fair value determination of the investments in privately held companies
with observable price changes, including controls over management’s assessment of whether the observable
transaction is orderly and whether the investment involved is similar to the Company’s investment and controls
over the determination of the fair value adjustments. These procedures also included, among others, testing
the fair value of these investments as determined by management, which included (i) evaluating whether the
observable transaction is orderly and whether the investment involved is similar to the Company’s investment, (ii)
testing the completeness, mathematical accuracy and relevance of key underlying data used in the valuation,
and (iii) evaluating the unobservable inputs, including volatility as well as rights and obligations of the
securities, as used in the valuation. The volatility was evaluated by considering the external market and industry
data of comparable businesses. The rights and obligations of the securities were evaluated by reading the
investment agreements. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the
reasonableness of the volatility used by management as well as the rights and obligations of the securities.

      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      For the Years Ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021




      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies

           (a) Basis of presentation
                The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
                principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

                Effective on July 30, 2019, the Company subdivided each of its issued and unissued ordinary shares
                into eight ordinary shares (the “Share Subdivision”). Following the Share Subdivision, the Company’s
                authorized share capital became United States Dollar (“US$”)100,000 divided into 32,000,000,000
                ordinary shares of par value US$0.000003125 per share. The number of issued and unissued ordinary
                shares as disclosed elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements are presented on a basis
                after taking into account the effects of the Share Subdivision and have been retrospectively adjusted,
                where applicable.

                Simultaneously with the Share Subdivision, the change in ratio of the Company’s ADS to ordinary
                share (the “ADS Ratio Change”) also became effective. Following the ADS Ratio Change, each
                ADS now represents eight ordinary shares. Previously, each ADS represented one ordinary share.
                Given that the ADS Ratio Change was exactly proportionate to the Share Subdivision, no new ADSs
                were issued to any ADS holder and the total number of the Company’s outstanding ADSs remains
                unchanged immediately after the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change became effective.

                For the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company changed the presentation of segment information
                as discussed in Notes 5 and 26. Accordingly, the Company presented segment information for the
                years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 in the same manner.

                Translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement,
                consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows from
                RMB into the US$ as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021 are solely for the convenience of the
                readers and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB6.5518, representing the exchange rate set
                forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 31, 2021. No representation
                is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at
                this rate, or at any other rate.

           (b) Use of estimates
                The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
                the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
                liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
                statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The
                Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
                believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
                carrying values of assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2021, the Company considered the economic
                implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its significant judgments and estimates. Given the impact
                and other unforeseen effects on the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates
                required increased judgment, and actual results could differ from these estimates.

           (c) Consolidation
                The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its
                subsidiaries, which include the PRC-registered entities directly or indirectly wholly owned by the
                Company (“WFOEs”) and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) over which the Company is the primary
                beneficiary. All transactions and balances among the Company and its subsidiaries have been
                eliminated upon consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are recorded in the
                consolidated income statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of
                disposal, as appropriate.

                                                                For the Years Ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021




2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         A subsidiary is an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the
         voting power; or (ii) the Company has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members
         of the board of directors or to cast a majority of votes at the meetings of the board of directors or
         to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee pursuant to a statute or under an
         agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. A VIE is required to be consolidated by the
         primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity holders in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
         controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
         without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

         Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
         added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
         the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment
         is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through various contractual arrangements with VIEs that are
         incorporated and 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by PRC
         citizens. Specifically, these PRC domestic companies that are material to the Company’s business are
         Zhejiang Taobao Network Co., Ltd., Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd., Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd.
         and Youku Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The registered capital of these PRC domestic
         companies was funded by the Company through loans extended to the equity holders of these PRC
         domestic companies.

         The Company has entered into certain exclusive technical services agreements with these PRC
         domestic companies, which entitle it to receive a majority of their residual returns and make it
         obligatory for the Company to absorb a majority of the risk of losses from their activities. In addition,
         the Company has entered into certain agreements with the equity holders of these PRC domestic
         companies, including loan agreements that require them to contribute registered capital to those
         PRC domestic companies, exclusive call option agreements to acquire the equity interests in these
         companies when permitted by the PRC laws, rules and regulations, equity pledge agreements of
         the equity interests held by those equity holders, and proxy agreements that irrevocably authorize
         individuals designated by the Company to exercise the equity owner’s rights over these PRC domestic
         companies.

         Details of the typical structure of the Company’s significant VIEs are set forth below:

         (i)   Contracts that give the Company effective control of VIEs
               Loan agreements
               Pursuant to the relevant loan agreements, the respective WFOEs have granted loans to the equity
               holders of the VIEs, which may only be used for the purpose of its business operation activities
               agreed by the WFOEs. The WFOEs may require acceleration of repayment at their absolute
               discretion. When the equity holders of the VIEs make early repayment of the outstanding
               amount, the WFOEs or a third-party designated by the WFOEs may purchase the equity interests
               in the VIEs at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the loan, subject to any applicable
               PRC laws, rules and regulations. The equity holders of the VIEs undertake not to enter into any
               prohibited transactions in relation to the VIEs, including the transfer of any business, material
               assets, intellectual property rights or equity interests in the VIEs to any third party.

                (i)   Contracts that give the Company effective control of VIEs (Continued)
                      Exclusive call option agreements
                      The equity holders of the VIEs have granted the WFOEs exclusive call options to purchase their
                      equity interest in the VIEs at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered
                      capital in the VIEs; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each
                      relevant VIE has further granted the relevant WFOE an exclusive call option to purchase its assets
                      at an exercise price equal to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by
                      applicable PRC laws, whichever is higher. Certain VIEs and their equity holders will also jointly
                      grant the WFOEs (A) exclusive call options to request the VIEs to decrease their registered capital
                      at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the VIEs and (ii)
                      the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws (the “Capital Decrease Price”), and (B)
                      exclusive call options to subscribe for the increased capital of the VIEs at a price equal to the
                      sum of the Capital Decrease Price and the unpaid registered capital, if applicable, as of the
                      capital decrease. The WFOEs may nominate another entity or individual to purchase the equity
                      interest or assets, or to subscribe for the increased capital, if applicable, under the call options.
                      Execution of each call option shall not violate the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                      Each equity holder of the VIE has agreed that the following amounts, to the extent in excess of
                      the original registered capital that they contributed to the VIE (after deduction of relevant tax
                      expenses), belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity
                      interests in the VIE, (ii) proceeds received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIE, and
                      (iii) distributions or liquidation residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIE upon
                      termination or liquidation. Moreover, any profits, distributions or dividends (after deduction of
                      relevant tax expenses) received by the VIEs also belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs. The
                      exclusive call option agreements remain in effect until the equity interest or assets that are the
                      subject of these agreements are transferred to the WFOEs.

                      Proxy agreements
                      Pursuant to the relevant proxy agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs irrevocably authorize
                      any person designated by the WFOEs to exercise their rights as the equity holders of the VIEs,
                      including without limitation the right to vote and appoint directors.

                      Equity pledge agreements
                      Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs have pledged
                      all of their interests in the equity of the VIEs as a continuing first priority security interest in favor
                      of the corresponding WFOEs to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant
                      loan agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the VIEs
                      and/or the equity holders under the other structure contracts. Each WFOE is entitled to exercise
                      its right to dispose of the pledged interests in the equity of the VIE held by the equity holders
                      and has priority in receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of
                      the pledged interests, in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other
                      structure contracts, if applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until the later
                      of (i) the full performance of the contractual arrangements by the relevant parties, and (ii) the
                      full repayment of the loans made to the equity holders of the VIEs.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         (ii)   Contracts that enable the Company to receive substantially all of the economic benefits
                from the VIEs
                Exclusive technology services agreements or exclusive services agreements
                Each relevant VIE has entered into an exclusive technology services agreement or an exclusive
                services agreement with the respective WFOE, pursuant to which the relevant WFOE provides
                exclusive services to the VIE. In exchange, the VIE pays a service fee to the WFOE, the amount of
                which shall be determined, to the extent permitted by applicable PRC laws as proposed by the
                WFOE, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits from the VIE to the WFOE.

                Other arrangements
                The exclusive call option agreements described above also entitle the WFOEs to all profits,
                distributions or dividends (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by the VIEs,
                and the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital that they
                contributed to the VIEs (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by each equity
                holder of the VIEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIEs, (ii) proceeds
                received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIEs, and (iii) distributions or liquidation
                residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIEs upon termination or liquidation.

         Based on these contractual agreements, the Company believes that the PRC domestic companies as
         described above should be considered as VIEs because the equity holders do not have significant
         equity at risk nor do they have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Given that the
         Company is the primary beneficiary of these PRC domestic companies, the Company believes that
         these VIEs should be consolidated based on the structure as described above.

         The following financial information of the VIEs in the PRC was recorded in the accompanying
         consolidated financial statements:

                                                                                             As of March 31,

           (i) Revenue generated by the VIEs are primarily from cloud computing services, digital media and entertainment services and
               others.

           The VIEs did not have any material related party transactions except for the related party transactions
           which are disclosed in Note 22 or elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, and those
           transactions with other subsidiaries that are not VIEs, which were eliminated upon consolidation.

           Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of the
           VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company considers
           that there is no asset in any of the VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIEs, except for
           registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all VIEs are incorporated as limited liability companies
           under the Company Law of the PRC, creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the
           Company for any of the liabilities of the VIEs.

           Currently, there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional financial
           support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based on the licenses and
           approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to provide financial support to the
           VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs, as well as the Company’s own business objectives
           in the future.

           Unrecognized revenue-producing assets held by the VIEs include certain Internet content provision and
           other licenses, domain names and trademarks. The Internet content provision and other licenses are
           required under relevant PRC laws, rules and regulations for the operation of Internet businesses in the PRC,
           and therefore are integral to the Company’s operations. The Internet content provision licenses require that
           core PRC trademark registrations and domain names are held by the VIEs that provide the relevant services.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests
         The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting
         in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations.” The
         cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets
         transferred to the sellers, liabilities incurred by the Company and equity instruments issued by
         the Company. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
         Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured separately at their fair values as
         of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the
         total costs of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value
         of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the acquisition date amounts of the
         identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than
         the acquisition date amounts of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized
         directly in the consolidated income statements. During the measurement period, which can be up to
         one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and
         liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the conclusion of the
         measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed,
         whichever comes first, any further adjustments are recorded in the consolidated income statements.

         In a business combination achieved in stages, the Company re-measures the previously held equity
         interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the
         re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated income statements.

         When there is a change in ownership interests or a change in contractual arrangements that results in
         a loss of control of a subsidiary, the Company deconsolidates the subsidiary from the date control is
         lost. Any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and is
         included in the calculation of the gain or loss upon deconsolidation of the subsidiary.

         For the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to
         reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. When the
         noncontrolling interest is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of a conditional event, which
         is not solely within the control of the Company, the noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine
         equity. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date that it
         becomes probable that the mezzanine equity will become redeemable to the earliest redemption date
         using the effective interest method. Consolidated net income in the consolidated income statements
         includes net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and mezzanine equity holders when
         applicable.

         Net (loss) income attributable to mezzanine equity holders is included in net loss attributable
         to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated income statements, while it is excluded from the
         consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity. During the years ended March 31, 2019,
         2020 and 2021, net (loss) income attributable to mezzanine equity holders amounted to RMB(438)
         million, RMB(124) million and RMB140 million, respectively. The cumulative results of operations
         attributable to noncontrolling interests, along with adjustments for share-based compensation
         expense arising from outstanding share-based awards relating to subsidiaries’ shares, are also
         recorded as noncontrolling interests on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows
         related to transactions with noncontrolling interests are presented under financing activities in the
         consolidated statements of cash flows.

           (e) Segment reporting
                 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to
                 the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), which is comprised of certain members of the
                 Company’s management team. The Company had four operating and reportable segments during the
                 periods presented as set out in Notes 1 and 26.

           (f)   Foreign currency translation
                 The functional currency of the Company is US$. The Company’s subsidiaries with operations in
                 mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC (“Hong Kong” or “Hong
                 Kong S.A.R.”), the United States and other jurisdictions generally use their respective local currencies
                 as their functional currencies. The reporting currency of the Company is RMB as the major operations
                 of the Company are within the PRC. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, other
                 than the subsidiaries with the functional currency of RMB, are translated into RMB using the exchange
                 rate as of the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and the average daily exchange rate for
                 each month for income and expense items. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated
                 other comprehensive income or loss as a component of shareholders’ equity.

                 In the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than the
                 functional currency are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate
                 in effect at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
                 are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
                 currency using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising from foreign
                 currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated income statements during the year in which
                 they occur.

           (g) Revenue recognition
                 Revenue is principally comprised of customer management revenue, membership fees, logistics
                 services revenue, cloud computing services revenue, sales of goods and other revenue. Revenue
                 represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of promised
                 goods or services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities and is recorded net of value-
                 added tax (“VAT”). Consistent with the criteria of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”,
                 the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control
                 of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a
                 point in time, the Company also considers the following indicators to assess whether control of
                 a promised good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to payment, (ii) legal title, (iii)
                 physical possession, (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership and (v) acceptance of the good or
                 service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue over time
                 by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.

                 For revenue arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations such as the sale of
                 proprietary cloud services packages, which include hardware, software license, software installation
                 service, and maintenance service, each distinct performance obligation is separately accounted
                 for and the total consideration is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative
                 standalone selling price at contract inception.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction to determine whether revenue
         should be recorded on a gross or net basis. The Company is acting as the principal if it obtains control
         over the goods and services before they are transferred to customers. Generally, when the Company
         is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, or
         has several but not all of these indicators, the Company acts as the principal and revenue is recorded
         on a gross basis. Generally, when the Company is not primarily obligated in a transaction, does not
         bear the inventory risk and does not have the ability to establish the price, the Company acts as the
         agent and revenue is recorded on a net basis.

         When services are exchanged or swapped for other services, revenue is recognized based on the
         estimated standalone selling price of services promised to customer if the fair value of the services
         received cannot be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized for barter transactions
         was not material for each of the periods presented.

         Practical expedients and exemptions
         The Company applies the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
         obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts for
         which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services
         performed.

         The Company does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised
         goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a result, the
         Company applies the practical expedient and does not adjust any of the transaction price for the time
         value of money.

         Revenue recognition policies by type are as follows:

         (i)   Customer management revenue
               Within the core commerce segment, the Company provides the following customer management
               services to merchants on the Company’s retail and wholesale marketplaces and certain third-
               party marketing affiliates’ websites:

               Pay-for-performance (“P4P”) marketing services
               P4P marketing services allow merchants to bid for keywords that match product or service
               listings appearing in search results on the Company’s marketplaces. Merchants bid for keywords
               through an online auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning
               are determined through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a
               market-based mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for P4P marketing services and the
               related revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the
               point of time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.

               In-feed marketing services
               In-feed marketing services allow merchants to bid to market to groups of consumers with similar
               profiles that match product or service listings appearing in browser results on the Company’s
               marketplaces. Merchants bid for groups of consumers with similar profiles through an online
               auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning are determined
               through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based
               mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for in-feed marketing services and the related
               revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the point of
               time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                (i)   Customer management revenue (Continued)
                      Display marketing services
                      Display marketing services allow merchants to place advertisements on the Company’s
                      marketplaces, at fixed prices or prices established by a market-based bidding system and
                      in particular formats. In general, merchants need to prepay for display marketing which is
                      accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized either ratably over the period in
                      which the advertisement is displayed as the merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as
                      the advertisement is displayed or when an advertisement is viewed by users, depending on the
                      type of marketing services selected by the merchants.

                      The Company also places P4P marketing services content and display marketing content through
                      the third-party marketing affiliate program. A substantial portion of customer management
                      revenue generated through the third-party marketing affiliate program represented P4P
                      marketing services revenue. In delivery of these customer management services, the Company,
                      through the third-party marketing affiliate program, places the P4P marketing services content
                      of the participating merchants on third-party online resources in the forms of picture or text links
                      through contextual relevance technology to match merchants’ marketing content to the textual
                      content of the third-party online resources and the users’ attributes based on the Company’s
                      systems and algorithms. When the links on third-party online resources are clicked, users are
                      diverted to a landing page of the Company’s marketplaces where listings of the participating
                      merchant as well as similar products or services of other merchants are presented. In limited
                      cases, the Company may embed a search box for one of its marketplaces on the third-party
                      online resources, and when a keyword is input into the search box, the user will be diverted to
                      the Company’s marketplaces where search results are presented. Revenue is recognized when
                      the users further click on the P4P marketing content on the landing pages. The Company places
                      display marketing content on third-party online resources in a similar manner. In general,
                      merchants need to prepay for display marketing which is accounted for as customer advances
                      and revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed as
                      merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as the advertisement is displayed.

                      P4P marketing services revenue, in-feed marketing services revenue, as well as display
                      marketing revenue generated on the Company’s marketplaces or through the third-party
                      marketing affiliate program are recorded on a gross basis when the Company is the principal to
                      the merchants in the arrangements. For third-party marketing affiliates with whom the Company
                      has an arrangement to share the revenue, traffic acquisition cost is also recognized at the same
                      time if the P4P marketing content on the landing page clicked by the users is from merchants
                      participating in the third-party marketing affiliate program.

                      Commissions on transactions
                      The Company earns commissions from merchants when transactions are completed on
                      Tmall and certain other retail marketplaces of the Company. The commissions are generally
                      determined as a percentage based on the value of merchandise being sold by the merchants.
                      The commission revenue includes merchant deposits that are expected to be non-refundable
                      and is accounted for as variable consideration (Note 2(ac)), which is estimated at contract
                      inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes
                      available. Revenue related to commissions is recognized in the consolidated income statements
                      based on the expected value when the performance obligation is satisfied. Adjustments to the
                      estimated variable consideration related to prior reporting periods were not material for each of
                      the periods presented.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         (i)    Customer management revenue (Continued)
                Taobaoke services
                In addition, the Company offers the Taobaoke program which generates commissions from
                merchants for transactions completed by consumers sourced from certain third-party marketing
                affiliates’ websites and mobile apps. The commission rates on Taobaoke are set by the
                merchants. The Company’s commission revenue is recognized at the time when the underlying
                transaction is completed. The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction
                to determine whether the commission revenue is recognized on a gross or net basis. When
                the Company is the agent of the arrangement (such as arrangements where the Company
                does not have latitude in establishing prices or does not have inventory risk), the commission
                revenue is recorded on a net basis. When the Company is the principal of the arrangement
                (such as arrangements where the Company is obligated to pay for website inventory costs in
                fixed amounts to third-party marketing affiliates regardless of whether commission revenue
                is generated from these marketing affiliates), the commission revenue is recorded on a gross
                basis.

         (ii)   Membership fees
                The Company earns membership fees revenue from wholesale sellers in respect of the sale of
                membership packages and subscriptions that allow them to host premium storefronts on the
                Company’s wholesale marketplaces, as well as the provision of other value-added services,
                and from customers in respect of the sale of membership packages which allow them to access
                premium content on Youku’s paid content platforms. These service fees are paid in advance
                for a specific contracted service period. All these fees are initially deferred as deferred revenue
                and customer advances when received and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
                respective service contracts as the services are provided.

         (iii) Logistics services revenue
                The Company earns logistics services revenue from domestic and international one-stop-shop
                logistics services and the supply chain management solutions provided by Cainiao Network and
                Lazada as well as on-demand delivery services provided by Ele.me. Revenue is recognized at
                the time when the logistics services are provided.

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                 (iv) Cloud computing services revenue
                       The Company earns cloud computing services revenue from the provision of services such as
                       elastic computing, database, storage, network virtualization services, large scale computing,
                       security, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine learning platform
                       and IoT services. These cloud computing services allow customers to use hosted software over
                       the contract period without taking possession of the software. Cloud computing services are
                       mainly charged on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services
                       charged on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related
                       to cloud services charged on a consumption basis, such as the quantity of storage or elastic
                       computing services used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of the
                       resources.

                 (v)   Sales of goods
                       Revenue from the sales of goods is mainly generated from Tmall Supermarket, Sun Art,
                       Freshippo and direct import. Revenue from the sales of goods is recognized when the control
                       over the promised goods is transferred to customers. Receipts of fees in respect of all other
                       incidental goods or services provided by the Company that are distinct performance obligations
                       are recognized when the control of the underlying goods or services is transferred to the
                       customers. The amounts relating to these incidental services are not material to the Company’s
                       total revenue for each of the periods presented.

           (h) Cost of revenue
                 Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of inventories, logistics costs, expenses associated with the
                 operation of the Company’s mobile platforms and websites (such as depreciation and maintenance
                 expenses for servers and computers, call centers and other equipment, and bandwidth and co-
                 location fees), staff costs and share-based compensation expense, traffic acquisition costs, content
                 costs, payment processing fees and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to
                 the Company’s principal operations.

           (i)   Product development expenses
                 Product development expenses consist primarily of staff costs and share-based compensation
                 expense for research and development personnel and other expenses that are directly attributable to
                 the development of new technologies and products for the businesses of the Company, such as the
                 development of the Internet infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and
                 networks.

                 The Company expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and implementation
                 phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance of the existing
                 websites or the development of software and website content. Costs incurred in the development
                 phase are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life. However, as the amount of costs
                 qualified for capitalization has been insignificant, all website and software development costs have
                 been expensed as incurred.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (j)   Sales and marketing expenses
           Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising expenses, promotion
           expenses, staff costs and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions and other related
           incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers and merchants.

           The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and
           expenses the costs of delivering advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or airtime
           is used. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled RMB22,013 million, RMB30,949 million and
           RMB57,073 million during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

     (k) Share-based compensation
           Share-based awards granted are measured at fair value on grant date and share-based
           compensation expense is recognized (i) immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are
           required, or (ii) using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
           requisite service period. The fair values of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares are
           determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying shares and the fair value of share
           options is generally determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The value is recognized
           as an expense over the respective service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Share-based
           compensation expense, when recognized, is charged to the consolidated income statements with the
           corresponding entry to additional paid-in capital, liability or noncontrolling interests as disclosed in
           Note 2(d).

           On each measurement date, the Company reviews internal and external sources of information to
           assist in the estimation of various attributes to determine the fair value of the share-based awards,
           including the fair value of the underlying shares, expected life and expected volatility. The Company
           recognizes the impact of any revisions to the original forfeiture rate assumptions in the consolidated
           income statements, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

           In April 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic
           718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” Before the adoption of
           this guidance, the equity-classified share-based awards held by non-employees were subject to
           re-measurement through each vesting date. Upon the adoption of this guidance, the Company no
           longer re-measures equity-classified share-based awards granted to consultants or non-employees
           at each reporting date through the vesting date and the accounting for these share-based awards to
           consultants or non-employees and employees was substantially aligned.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report     295

           (l)   Other employee benefits
                 The Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer
                 defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits
                 are provided to employees. The relevant labor regulations require the Company’s subsidiaries in
                 the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions based on the
                 applicable benchmarks and rates stipulated by the local government. The relevant local labor and
                 social welfare authorities are responsible for meeting all retirement benefits obligations and the
                 Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC have no further commitments beyond their monthly contributions.
                 The contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred. During the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020
                 and 2021, contributions to the plan amounting to RMB5,608 million, RMB6,317 million and RMB7,850
                 million, respectively, were charged to the consolidated income statements.

                 The Company also makes payments to other defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for
                 the benefit of employees employed by subsidiaries outside of the PRC. Amounts contributed during
                 the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were insignificant.

           (m) Income taxes
                 The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income tax
                 is recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
                 carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
                 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
                 in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
                 tax of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
                 enactment date. Valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more
                 likely than not that the asset will not be realizable in the foreseeable future.

                 Deferred tax is recognized on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, which are presumed to be
                 distributed to parent companies, unless there is sufficient evidence that the subsidiaries have invested
                 or will invest the undistributed earnings permanently in the domestic jurisdictions or the earnings
                 will not be subject to tax upon the subsidiaries’ liquidation. Deferred tax is recognized for temporary
                 differences in relation to certain investments in equity method investees, equity securities and other
                 investments.

                 The Company adopts ASC 740 “Income Taxes” which prescribes a more likely than not threshold
                 for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
                 taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
                 classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and
                 penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income
                 tax disclosures. The Company did not have significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any
                 unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of and for
                 the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

           (n) Government grants
                 Government grants, which mainly represent amounts received from central and local governments in
                 connection with the Company’s investments in local business districts and contributions to technology
                 development, are recognized as income in other income, net or as a reduction of specific costs and
                 expenses for which the grants are intended to compensate. Such amounts are recognized in the
                 consolidated income statements upon receipt and when all conditions attached to the grants are
                 fulfilled.

     (o) Leases
        In April 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
        842)”, including certain transitional guidance and subsequent amendments within ASU 2018-01,
        ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01 (collectively, including ASU 2016-02, “ASC
        842”), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).

        ASC 842 supersedes the lease requirements in ASC 840 “Leases”, and generally requires lessees
        to recognize operating and finance lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the
        balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty
        of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits
        and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases as if there was an
        acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease. All other leases
        are accounted for as operating leases. The Company has no significant finance leases.

        The Company adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method by applying
        the new lease standard to all leases existing as of April 1, 2019, the date of initial application. The
        adoption of the new lease standard does not have any significant impact on the results of operations
        and cash flows and there was no adjustment to the beginning retained earnings on April 1, 2019.

        The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance,
        which allowed the Company to carry forward previous lease classification, the assessment on whether
        a contract was or contained a lease, and the initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to April
        1, 2019.

        Under ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease
        right-of-use assets are included in non-current prepayments, receivables and other assets (Note 13),
        and operating lease liabilities are included in current accrued expenses, accounts payable and other
        liabilities and other non-current liabilities (Note 19) on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating
        lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present
        value of future lease payments at lease commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset also
        includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and the initial direct costs incurred
        by the lessee and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. As the interest rates implicit in most
        of the leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates based
        on the information available at lease commencement to determine the present value of the future
        lease payments. Operating lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of
        the lease.

        The Company elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for leases of certain asset
        classes such as shops and malls and equipment leases. Lease and non-lease components for leases
        of other asset classes are accounted for separately. The Company also elected not to recognize short-
        term leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less.

        Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, the Company incurred rental expenses under operating leases of
        RMB4,699 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, components of
        operating lease cost recorded in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31,
        2020 and 2021 are set out in Note 6.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (p) Cash and cash equivalents
                 The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
                 months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily
                 represent bank deposits and fixed deposits with original maturities of less than three months.

           (q) Short-term investments
                 Short-term investments consist primarily of investments in fixed deposits with original maturities
                 between three months and one year and certain investments in wealth management products and
                 other investments that the Company has the intention to redeem within one year. As of March 31, 2020
                 and 2021, the investments in fixed deposits that were recorded as short-term investments amounted
                 to RMB19,147 million and RMB104,896 million, respectively.

           (r) Accounts receivable
                 Accounts receivable represent the amounts that the Company has an unconditional right to
                 consideration. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
                 uncollectible receivable amounts. In April 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial
                 Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement on Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”,
                 including certain subsequent amendments, transitional guidance and other interpretive guidance
                 within ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and ASU 2020-03
                 (collectively, including ASU 2016-13, “ASC 326”). ASC 326 introduces an approach based on expected
                 losses to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts, which replaces the previous incurred loss
                 impairment model. The Company’s estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts considers factors
                 such as historical credit loss experience, age of receivable balances, current market conditions,
                 reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as an assessment of
                 receivables due from specific identifiable counterparties to determine whether these receivables are
                 considered at risk or uncollectible. The Company assesses collectibility by pooling receivables that
                 have similar risk characteristics and evaluates receivables individually when specific receivables no
                 longer share those risk characteristics. The adoption of ASC 326 did not have a material impact on
                 the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The consolidated financial
                 statements as of March 31, 2020 and for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 were not
                 retrospectively adjusted.

           (s)   Inventories
                 Inventories mainly consist of merchandise available for sale. They are accounted for using the
                 weighted average cost method and stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
                 value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
                 completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

     (t)   Equity securities and other investments
           Equity securities and other investments represent the Company’s investments in equity securities that
           are not accounted for under the equity method, as well as other investments which primarily consist
           of debt investments.

           (i)    Equity securities
                  Equity securities not accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with
                  unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements, according to ASC
                  321 “Investments — Equity Securities”, which the Company adopted beginning April 1, 2018.
                  Upon the adoption of ASC 321, unrealized gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
                  income as of March 31, 2018 related to equity securities previously classified as available-for-
                  sale, in the amount of RMB8,196 million, net of tax, were reclassified into retained earnings as of
                  April 1, 2018.

                  The Company elected to record a majority of equity investments in privately held companies
                  using the measurement alternative at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for
                  observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments
                  of the same issuer.

                  Equity investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative
                  are subject to periodic impairment reviews. The Company’s impairment analysis considers both
                  qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the fair value of these
                  equity securities, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                  In computing realized gains and losses on equity securities, the Company determines cost based
                  on amounts paid using the average cost method. Dividend income is recognized when the right
                  to receive the payment is established.

           (ii)   Debt investments
                  Debt investments are accounted for at amortized cost or under the fair value option, which
                  the Company has elected for certain investments including convertible and exchangeable
                  bonds subscribed. The fair value option permits the irrevocable election on an instrument-
                  by-instrument basis at initial recognition or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of
                  accounting for that instrument. The investments accounted for under the fair value option are
                  carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income
                  statements. Interest income from debt investments is recognized using the effective interest
                  method which is reviewed and adjusted periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows.

     (u) Investments in equity method investees
           The Company applies the equity method to account for equity investments in common stock or in-
           substance common stock, according to ASC 323 “Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures”,
           over which it has significant influence but does not own a controlling financial interest, unless the fair
           value option is elected for an investment.

           An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward
           characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity’s common stock. The Company considers
           subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining
           whether an investment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity’s common
           stock.




                                                                                     Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report     299

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (u) Investments in equity method investees (Continued)
                Under the equity method, the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the equity
                method investee is recognized in the consolidated income statements and its share of post-acquisition
                movements in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive
                income. The Company records its share of the results of the equity method investees on a one quarter
                in arrears basis. The excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the underlying equity in net
                assets of the equity method investee generally represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired.
                When the Company’s share of losses of the equity method investee equals or exceeds its interest in
                the equity method investee, the Company does not recognize further losses, unless the Company has
                incurred obligations or made payments or guarantees on behalf of the equity method investee.

                The Company continually reviews its investments in equity method investees to determine whether
                a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The primary factors the
                Company considers in its determination include the severity and the length of time that the fair value
                of the investment is below its carrying value; the financial condition, the operating performance and
                the prospects of the equity method investee; the geographic region, market and industry in which the
                equity method investee operates, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
                and other company specific information such as recent financing rounds completed by the equity
                method investee. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value
                of the investment in the equity method investee is written down to its fair value.

           (v) Property and equipment, net
                Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
                loss. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with no residual value based on the
                estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range as follows:

                Computer equipment and software                      3 – 5 years
                Furniture, office and transportation equipment       3 – 10 years
                Buildings                                            10 – 50 years
                Property improvements                                shorter of remaining lease period or estimated
                                                                     useful life


                Construction in progress represents buildings and related premises under construction, which is
                stated at actual construction cost less any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to
                the respective category of property and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use.

                Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and asset improvements are capitalized.
                The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of or retired are removed from the
                accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated income statements.

     (w) Intangible assets other than licensed copyrights
         Intangible assets mainly include those acquired through business combinations and purchased
         intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recognized as
         assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion.
         Intangible assets arising from business combinations are measured at fair value upon acquisition
         using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and ratio analysis with reference to
         comparable companies in similar industries under the income approach, market approach and cost
         approach. Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangible assets include
         future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Purchased intangible assets are initially
         recognized and measured at cost upon acquisition. Separately identifiable intangible assets that have
         determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line
         method as follows:

         User base and customer relationships                 3 – 16 years
         Trade names, trademarks and domain names             5 – 20 years
         Developed technology and patents                     2 – 7 years
         Non-compete agreements                               over the contracted term of up to 10 years


     (x) Licensed copyrights
         Licensed copyrights related to titles to movies, television series, variety shows, animations and other
         video content acquired from external parties are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or fair
         value. The amortization period for the licensed content vary depending on the type of content, which
         typically ranges from six months to ten years. Licensed copyrights are presented on the consolidated
         balance sheets as current assets under prepayments, receivables and other assets, or non-current
         assets under intangible assets, net, based on estimated time of usage. Licensed copyrights are
         generally amortized using an accelerated method based on historical viewership consumption
         patterns. Estimates of the consumption patterns for licensed copyrights are reviewed periodically and
         revised if necessary. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, amortization expenses in
         connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB11,391 million, RMB9,390 million and RMB9,093 million
         were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s digital media and entertainment segment.

         On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates the program usefulness of licensed copyrights pursuant
         to the guidance in ASC 920 “Entertainment — Broadcasters”, which provides that the rights be
         reported at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. When there is a change in the expected usage
         of licensed copyrights, the Company estimates the fair value of licensed copyrights to determine if
         any impairment exists. The fair value of licensed copyrights is determined by estimating the expected
         cash flows from advertising and membership fees, less any costs and expenses, over the remaining
         useful lives of the licensed copyrights at the film-group level. Estimates that impact these cash flows
         include anticipated levels of demand for the Company’s advertising services and the expected selling

         connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB2,843 million, RMB2,654 million and RMB1,688 million
         were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s digital media and entertainment segment.

      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      For the Years Ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021




      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (x) Licensed copyrights (Continued)
                 In April 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2019-02, “Entertainment — Films — Other Assets — Film
                 Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment — Broadcasters — Intangibles — Goodwill and Other
                 (Subtopic 920-350)”. As a result of the adoption of this new accounting update, cash outflows for
                 the acquisition of licensed copyrights amounting to RMB11,811 million are classified as operating
                 activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2021. Comparative
                 figures were not retrospectively adjusted and were classified as investing activities in the consolidated
                 statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. The adoption of this guidance
                 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

           (y)   Goodwill
                 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition date amounts of the
                 identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired entity
                 as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries. Goodwill is not amortized but
                 is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
                 indicate that it might be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine
                 whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative
                 assessment, the Company considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
                 considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information
                 related to the operations, business plans and strategies of the reporting unit, including consideration
                 of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than
                 not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment
                 test is performed.

                 In April 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):
                 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”. After adopting this guidance, the Company performs
                 the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
                 amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
                 goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
                 value, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value is recognized
                 as impairment. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment,
                 including the identification of reporting units, allocation of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting
                 units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The adoption of this guidance did not
                 have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

           (z) Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and licensed copyrights
                 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
                 indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
                 be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future
                 undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the assets are considered to be
                 impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
                 assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There was no material impairment for long-lived assets
                 recognized for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

                                                              For the Years Ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021




2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (aa) Derivatives and hedging
         All contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are recognized on the consolidated balance
         sheets as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
         are either recognized periodically in the consolidated income statements or in other comprehensive
         income depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting and
         are so designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.

         In April 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted
         Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities”, including certain transitional guidance and
         subsequent amendments within ASU 2019-04 (collectively, “ASU 2017-12”).

         To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented
         at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which
         includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge
         effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be effective in accomplishing the objective of
         offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of
         the hedging relationship is evaluated on a prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and
         quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of
         the derivative to those of the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the changes
         in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to that of the hedged item. A
         hedging relationship is considered initially effective if the results of the hedging instrument are within
         a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.

         Interest rate swaps
         Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the cash flows attributable
         to recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted payments may qualify as cash flow hedges. The
         Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap floating interest payments related
         to certain borrowings for fixed interest payments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with
         certain forecasted payments and obligations. For the year ended March 31, 2019, the effective
         portion of changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that were designated and qualified as
         cash flow hedges was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The gain or loss
         relating to the ineffective portion was recognized immediately in interest and investment income,
         net in the consolidated income statements. Upon the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on April 1, 2019,
         all changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow
         hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts in accumulated other
         comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged
         forecasted transaction affects earnings both before and after the adoption of ASU 2017-12.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report     303

      For the Years Ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021




      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (ab) Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes
                Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes are recognized initially at fair value, net of upfront
                fees, debt discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees. Upfront fees, debt
                discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees are recorded as a reduction of
                the proceeds received and the related accretion is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated
                income statements over the estimated term of the facilities using the effective interest method.

           (ac) Merchant deposits
                The Company collects deposits representing an annual upfront service fee from merchants on Tmall
                and AliExpress before the beginning of each calendar year. These deposits are initially recorded as
                a liability by the Company. The deposits are refundable to a merchant if the level of sales volume
                that is generated by that merchant on Tmall or AliExpress meets the target during the period. If the
                transaction volume target is not met at the end of each calendar year, the relevant deposits will
                become non-refundable. These merchant deposits are accounted for as variable consideration at an
                amount that is estimated at contract inception. The estimate is updated at the end of each reporting
                period and when there are changes in circumstances during the reporting period. Merchant deposits
                are recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statements when the likelihood of refund to
                the merchant is considered remote based on the patterns of sales volume generated by the merchant
                during the reporting period.

           (ad) Deferred revenue and customer advances
                Deferred revenue and customer advances generally represent cash received from customers
                that relate to goods or services to be provided in the future. Deferred revenue, mainly relating to
                membership fees and cloud computing services revenue, is stated at the amount of service fees
                received less the amount previously recognized as revenue upon the provision of the respective
                services to customers.

           (ae) Commitments and contingencies
                In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings
                and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for the
                contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
                the liability can be reasonably estimated.

                Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which
                may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events
                occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses these contingent liabilities, which inherently involves
                judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the
                Company or unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, the Company, in consultation
                with its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims
                as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If
                the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred
                and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the
                consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
                contingency is not probable, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent
                liability, together with an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible loss, if determinable and
                material, would be disclosed.

                Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in
                which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (af) Treasury shares
          The Company accounts for treasury shares using the cost method. Under this method, the cost
          incurred to purchase the shares is recorded in the treasury shares account on the consolidated
          balance sheets. At retirement of the treasury shares, the ordinary shares account is charged only for
          the aggregate par value of the shares. The excess of the acquisition cost of treasury shares over the
          aggregate par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital (up to the amount credited to the
          additional paid-in capital upon original issuance of the shares) and retained earnings. The treasury
          shares account includes 146,780,688 ordinary shares and 143,363,408 ordinary shares issued at par
          to wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company for the purpose of certain equity investment plans for
          management as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

     (ag) Statutory reserves
          In accordance with the relevant regulations and their articles of association, subsidiaries of the
          Company incorporated in the PRC are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profit
          determined based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations to the general reserve until
          the reserve has reached 50% of the relevant subsidiary’s registered capital. Appropriations to the
          enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the respective
          board of directors of the subsidiaries. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are
          not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. During the years
          ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, appropriations to the general reserve amounted to RMB690
          million, RMB1,032 million and RMB1,247 million, respectively. No appropriations to the enterprise
          expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund have been made by the Company.

3.   Recent accounting pronouncements
     In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting
     for Income Taxes”, which simplifies various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-
     12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing
     guidance to improve consistent application. The new guidance is effective for the Company for the year
     ending March 31, 2022 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2022. The Company
     does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial position,
     results of operations and cash flows.

     In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments — Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments
     — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) — Clarifying
     the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues
     Task Force)”, which clarifies the interactions of the accounting for certain equity securities under ASC
     321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323, and the accounting
     for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. ASU 2020-01 could
     change how an entity accounts for (i) an equity security under the measurement alternative and (ii) a
     forward contract or purchased option to purchase securities that, upon settlement of the forward contract
     or exercise of the purchased option, would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or
     the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825 “Financial Instruments”. These amendments improve
     current U.S. GAAP by reducing diversity in practice and increasing comparability of the accounting for
     these interactions. The new guidance is effective prospectively for the Company for the year ending March
     31, 2022 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2022. The Company does not
     expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial position, results of
     operations and cash flows.

      3.   Recent accounting pronouncements (Continued)
           In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects
           of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and issued a subsequent amendment which refines the
           scope of the ASU and clarifies some of its guidance as part of the FASB’s monitoring of global reference
           rate reform activities in January 2021 within ASU 2021-01 (collectively, including ASU 2020-04, “ASC 848”).
           ASC 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP on contract modifications
           and hedge accounting to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or
           another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are
           met. These optional expedients and exceptions provided in ASC 848 are effective for the Company from
           January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company has elected the optional expedients for certain
           existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, which did not have a material impact
           on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company is evaluating the effects, if
           any, of the potential election of the other optional expedients and exceptions provided in this guidance on
           the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

           In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-
           20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for
           Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies an issuer’s accounting
           for certain convertible instruments and the application of derivatives scope exception for contracts in an
           entity’s own equity. This guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the
           diluted earnings per share calculation and required enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible
           instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new guidance is required to be applied either
           retrospectively to financial instruments outstanding as of the beginning of the first comparable reporting
           period for each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change
           to be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption.
           This guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2023 and interim reporting
           periods during the year ending March 31, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
           the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on the financial position, results of operations and cash
           flows.

      4.   Significant mergers and acquisitions and investments

           Mergers and acquisitions
           (a)   Acquisition of Sun Art Retail Group Limited (“Sun Art”)
                 Sun Art, a company that is listed on the HKSE, is a leading hypermarket operator in the PRC. The
                 Company previously held an approximately 31% effective equity interest in Sun Art and the investment
                 in Sun Art was previously accounted for under the equity method (Note 14). New Retail Strategic
                 Opportunities Fund, L.P. (the “Offshore Retail Fund”), an investment fund for which the Company is
                 able to exercise significant influence over its investment decisions, is also an existing shareholder in
                 Sun Art.

                 In October 2020, the Company acquired additional effective equity interest in Sun Art for a cash
                 consideration of US$3.6 billion (RMB24.1 billion). Upon the completion of the transaction, the
                 Company’s effective equity interest in Sun Art increased to approximately 67% and Sun Art became
                 a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. In December 2020, the Company acquired additional
                 ordinary shares of Sun Art from public shareholders for a cash consideration of HK$4.9 billion (RMB4.1
                 billion) through a mandatory general offer as required under the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and
                 Mergers, which resulted in a reduction in noncontrolling interests amounting to RMB4,592 million.
                 Upon the completion of the mandatory general offer, the Company’s effective equity interest in Sun
                 Art further increased to approximately 74%.

           A gain of RMB6,381 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
           recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
           ended March 31, 2021. The fair value of the previously held equity interests was estimated with

           As reported in Sun Art’s 2020/2021 annual report, revenue and net income for the 15 months ended
           March 31, 2021 were RMB124.3 billion and RMB3.8 billion, respectively. Revenue and net income for

           The acquisition of Sun Art demonstrates the Company’s continued commitment to Sun Art as well as
           its New Retail strategy by further integrating online and offline resources in the PRC’s retail sector.
           Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the combined
           operations of Sun Art and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and
           experience in the retail sector in the PRC. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be
           deductible for income tax purposes.

                 entertainment experiences for consumers in the PRC. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was
                 attributable to the synergies expected from the combined operations of Alibaba Pictures and the
                 Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in the digital media
                 and entertainment sector in the PRC. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be
                 deductible for income tax purposes.

           (d) Acquisitions and integration of Rajax Holding (“Ele.me”) and Koubei Holding Limited (“Koubei”)
                 Ele.me
                 Ele.me is a leading local services and on-demand delivery platform in the PRC, which was previously
                 owned by a joint investment vehicle established by the Company and Ant Group. The Company
                 previously held an approximately 27% effective equity interest in Ele.me on a fully diluted basis and
                 the investment was previously accounted for using the measurement alternative.

                 In May 2018, the joint investment vehicle completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of
                 Ele.me that it did not already own at a consideration of US$5,482 million (RMB34,923 million). Upon
                 the completion of the acquisition, Ele.me became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

                 The allocation of the purchase price as of the date of acquisition is summarized as follows:

         (Continued)
         Ele.me (Continued)
         (i) Net liabilities assumed primarily included payables to merchants and other logistics providers of RMB4,259 million as
             of the date of acquisition.
         (ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets had estimated amortization periods not exceeding ten years and a weighted-
              average amortization period of 5.8 years.
         (iii) Fair value of the noncontrolling interests was estimated based on the equity value of Ele.me derived by the purchase
               consideration, adjusted for a discount for control premium.
         (iv) The amount is payable contingent upon the satisfaction of certain non-compete provisions by the respective selling
              equity holders, and will not exceed RMB4,790 million.

         A gain of RMB1,657 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
         recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
         ended March 31, 2019. The fair value of the previously held equity interests was estimated based on
         the equity value of Ele.me derived by the purchase consideration, adjusted for a discount for control
         premium.

         The Company expected that the acquisition will deepen Ele.me’s integration into the Company’s
         ecosystem and advance the Company’s New Retail strategy to provide a seamless online and offline
         consumer experience in the consumer services sector. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was
         attributable to the synergies expected from the combined operations of Ele.me and the Company, the
         assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in the consumer services sector in the PRC.
         The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

         Integration of Ele.me and Koubei
         Koubei is one of the PRC’s leading restaurant and local services guide platforms for in-store
         consumption, which was previously set up by the Company and Ant Group. The investment in Koubei
         was previously accounted for under the equity method.

         In December 2018, the Company completed the integration of Ele.me and Koubei under a newly
         established holding company and paid a cash consideration of US$465 million (RMB3,196 million)
         in connection with the integration. Immediately prior to the integration, the Company held an
         approximately 90% equity interest in Ele.me and an approximately 38% equity interest in Koubei on
         a fully diluted basis. Upon the completion of the integration, the Company held an approximately
         72% equity interest in this new holding company (“Local Services Holdco”) which owns substantially
         all of the equity interest in Ele.me and Koubei, resulting in an effective controlling equity interest
         held by the Company in each of Ele.me and Koubei, and Koubei became a consolidated subsidiary
         of the Company. Upon the completion of the integration, the Company’s effective equity interest in
         Ele.me decreased, resulting in an increase in noncontrolling interests and additional paid-in capital
         amounting to RMB6,715 million and RMB7,515 million, respectively.

                (i) Net assets acquired primarily included cash and cash equivalents of RMB4,475 million as of the date of acquisition.

                     average amortization period of 6.3 years.
                (iii) Fair value of the noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date was estimated based on the purchase price

                      December 2018, with certain adjustments made to reflect other factors that may affect the fair value estimation.

                A gain of RMB21,990 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
                recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
                ended March 31, 2019. The fair value of the previously held equity interests as of the acquisition date

                deliver consumer insights and digitized operational solutions to empower local merchants on the
                Koubei platform. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected
                from the combined operations of Koubei and the Company, the assembled workforce and their
                knowledge and experience in the consumer services sector in the PRC. The Company did not expect
                the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

           (i) Net assets acquired primarily included cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,206 million as of the date of acquisition.
           (ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets had estimated amortization periods not exceeding 15 years and a weighted-
                average amortization period of 12.5 years.
           (iii) Fair value of the noncontrolling interests was estimated with reference to the purchase price per share as of the
                 acquisition date, adjusted for a discount for control premium, and includes the fair value of an option granted to the
                 founders of Trendyol to acquire additional interests in Trendyol from the Company as of the date of acquisition.

           The acquisition of Trendyol underscored the Company’s commitment to international expansion.
           Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the combined
           operations of Trendyol and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and
           experience in e-commerce. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for
           income tax purposes.

     (m) Investment in AliExpress Russia Holding Pte. Ltd. (“AliExpress Russia Joint Venture”) (Continued)
         The contribution of the Company’s AliExpress Russia businesses into the joint venture resulted in
         the deconsolidation of these businesses, and a one-time gain of RMB10.3 billion was recognized in
         interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year ended March
         31, 2020.

         RMB4,290 million was allocated to goodwill, RMB116 million was allocated to deferred tax liabilities

         the Company and this shareholder in the future. In December 2020, this shareholder exercised a
         call option under this agreement to acquire additional equity interest in the AliExpress Russia Joint
         Venture from the Company for a cash consideration of US$194 million (RMB1,269 million). Upon the

     (n) Investment in Ant Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”)
         Ant Group provides comprehensive digital payment services and offers digital financial services and
         digital daily life services for consumers and small and micro businesses, in China and across the
         world. In August 2014, the Company entered into a share and asset purchase agreement (together
         with all subsequent amendments, the “SAPA”), and entered into or amended certain ancillary
         agreements including an amendment and restatement of the intellectual property license agreement
         (the “2014 IPLA”) with Alipay.com Co., Ltd. (“Alipay”), a subsidiary of Ant Group. Pursuant to these
         agreements, the Company restructured its relationships with Ant Group and Alipay.

         In February 2018, the Company amended both the SAPA and the Alipay commercial agreement,
         and agreed with Ant Group and certain other parties on forms of certain ancillary agreements. In
         September 2019, the Company further amended the SAPA and entered into a cross license agreement
         and certain ancillary agreements and amendments, including the previously agreed form of
         amendment and restatement of the 2014 IPLA (“the Amended IPLA”). In August 2020, the Company
         further amended the SAPA, the Alipay commercial agreement and certain other agreements.
         These amendments were made primarily to facilitate Ant Group’s planned IPO on the Science and
         Technology Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and on the Main Board of the HKSE.

         SAPA
         Issuance of equity interest
         In September 2019, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions, the Company received the 33%
         equity interest in Ant Group pursuant to the SAPA.

         Under the SAPA, the consideration to acquire the newly issued 33% equity interest in Ant Group was
         fully funded by concurrent payments from Ant Group to the Company in consideration for certain
         intellectual property rights and assets that the Company transferred to Ant Group upon the issuance
         of the equity interest. Such consideration was determined based on the fair values of the underlying
         assets exchanged in the transaction as described above at contract inception in 2014, whereby the

                SAPA (Continued)
                Issuance of equity interest (Continued)
                The Company accounts for its equity interest in Ant Group under the equity method (Note 14). Upon
                the receipt of the equity interest in September 2019, this investment was initially measured at cost,
                with an upward adjustment determined based on the fair value of the Company’s share of Ant Group’s
                net assets as of the completion date of the transaction.

                Upon the completion, the Company recorded the 33% equity interest in Ant Group with a
                carrying value amounting to RMB90.7 billion in investment in equity method investees, other cost
                reimbursement of RMB0.6 billion from Ant Group to the Company pursuant to the SAPA and the
                deferred tax effect of RMB19.7 billion, with a corresponding gain of RMB71.6 billion recorded in
                interest and investment income, net in the year ended March 31, 2020. The difference between the
                carrying value of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the Company’s share of the carrying value
                of Ant Group’s net assets upon completion is a basis difference, which mainly represents the fair
                value adjustments of amortizable intangible assets with a weighted average amortization period of
                9.5 years and equity investments. These adjustments amounted to RMB24.5 billion and RMB5.3 billion,
                respectively, both of which were net of their corresponding tax effects.

                The application of accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in
                Ant Group and the recognition of the upward adjustment require significant management judgment,
                which included (i) determination of the contract inception date of the SAPA for the initial measurement
                of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and (ii) determination of the accounting treatment for the
                difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the
                cost of investment when the former is greater than the latter.

                In relation to the determination of the contract inception date of the SAPA, management considered
                the relevant U.S. GAAP guidance and focused on the legal enforceability of the agreement, and
                determined that the contract inception date was in 2014.

                In relation to the determination of the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company’s
                share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the cost of investment when the former
                is greater than the latter, in the absence of specific guidance and with the diversity in practice,
                management assessed various views derived from the interpretations of relevant U.S. GAAP and
                made reference to the relevant guidance of other international accounting framework and recognized
                the difference under interest and investment income, net with a corresponding increase to the initial
                carrying value of the investment in Ant Group.

                Subsequent to the receipt of the equity interest in Ant Group, the proportionate share of results of
                Ant Group, adjusted for the effects of the basis difference as described above, is recorded in share of
                results of equity method investees in the consolidated income statements on a one quarter in arrears
                basis.

         SAPA (Continued)
         Pre-emptive rights
         Following the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group, the Company has pre-emptive rights to
         participate in other issuances of equity securities by Ant Group and certain of its affiliates prior to
         the time of Ant Group meeting certain minimum criteria for a qualified IPO set forth in the SAPA (a
         “Qualified IPO”). These pre-emptive rights entitle the Company to maintain the equity ownership
         percentage the Company holds in Ant Group immediately prior to any such issuances. In connection
         with the exercise of the pre-emptive rights, the Company is also entitled to receive certain payments
         from Ant Group, effectively funding the subscription for these additional equity interest, up to a value
         of US$1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, under the SAPA, in certain circumstances
         the Company is permitted to exercise pre-emptive rights through an alternative arrangement which
         will further protect the Company from dilution. The value of the pre-emptive rights was considered to
         be insignificant upon the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group.

         Corporate governance provisions
         Under the SAPA, in addition to an independent director, the Company has the right to nominate two
         officers or employees of the Company for election to the board of Ant Group. In each case, these
         director nomination rights will continue unless the Company ceases to own a certain amount of its
         post-issuance equity interest in Ant Group or upon the completion of a Qualified IPO of Ant Group,
         whichever is earlier. In September 2019, the Company nominated two officers of the Company who
         have then been elected to the board of Ant Group pursuant to these director nomination rights under
         the SAPA.

         2014 IPLA and Amended IPLA
         2014 IPLA
         Under the 2014 IPLA, the Company received, in addition to a software technology service fee, royalty
         streams related to Alipay and other current and future businesses of Ant Group (collectively, the “Profit
         Share Payments”). The Profit Share Payments were paid at least annually and equaled the sum of
         an expense reimbursement plus 37.5% of the consolidated pre-tax income of Ant Group, subject to
         certain adjustments. The expense reimbursement represented the reimbursement for the costs and
         expenses incurred by the Company in the provision of software technology services. The Company
         accounted for the Profit Share Payments in the periods when the services were provided, where the
         payments were expected to approximate the estimated fair values of the services provided. Upon the
         receipt of the equity interest in September 2019, the Company terminated the 2014 IPLA, and the Profit
         Share Payments arrangement was terminated.

         Income in connection with the Profit Share Payments, net of costs incurred by the Company, of
         RMB517 million and RMB3,835 million, was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated income
         statements for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively (Note 22).

     The leases may include variable payments based on measures such as the level of sales at a physical store,
     which are expensed as incurred.

     Components of operating lease cost are as follows:

                                                                                                   Year ended March 31,

           Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital
           gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands
           withholding tax is imposed. The Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to the
           Hong Kong profits tax rate at 16.5% for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company’s
           subsidiaries incorporated in other jurisdictions were subject to income tax charges calculated according to
           the tax laws enacted or substantially enacted in the countries where they operate and generate income.

           Current income tax expense primarily includes the provision for PRC Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) for
           subsidiaries operating in the PRC and withholding tax on earnings that have been declared for distribution
           by PRC subsidiaries to offshore holding companies. Substantially all of the Company’s income before
           income tax and share of results of equity method investees are generated by these PRC subsidiaries. These
           subsidiaries are subject to EIT on their taxable income as reported in their respective statutory financial
           statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and regulations in the PRC.

7.   Income tax expenses (Continued)

     Composition of income tax expenses (Continued)
     Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for
     domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for,
     among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology
     Enterprises. Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as Software Enterprises and thereby entitled
     to full exemption from EIT for two years beginning from their first profitable calendar year and a 50%
     reduction for the subsequent three calendar years. In addition, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise
     (“KSE”) within China’s national plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The KSE status is subject to
     review by the relevant authorities every year and the timing of the annual review and notification by the
     relevant authorities may vary from year to year. The related reduction in tax expense as a result of official
     notification confirming the KSE status is accounted for upon the receipt of such notification.

     The tax status of the subsidiaries of the Company with major taxable profits is described below:

     •    Alibaba (China) Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alibaba China”) and Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd. (“Taobao
          China”) and Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tmall China”), entities primarily engaged in the
          operations of the Company’s wholesale marketplaces, Taobao Marketplace and Tmall, respectively,
          obtained the annual review and notification relating to the renewal of the KSE status for the taxation
          years of 2017, 2018 and 2019 in the quarters ended September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
          Accordingly, Alibaba China, Taobao China and Tmall China, which had qualified as High and New
          Technology Enterprises and applied an EIT rate of 15% for the taxation years of 2017, 2018 and
          2019, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation years of 2017, 2018 and 2019 in the
          consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

     •    Alibaba (Beijing) Software Services Co., Ltd (“Alibaba Beijing”), an entity primarily engaged in the
          operations of technology, software research and development and relevant services, was recognized
          as a High and New Technology Enterprise. Alibaba Beijing was also granted the Software Enterprise
          status and was thereby entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning from its first
          profitable taxation year of 2017, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three consecutive years
          starting from the taxation year of 2019. Accordingly, Alibaba Beijing was entitled to an EIT rate of
          12.5% during the taxation years of 2019 and 2020. Alibaba Beijing obtained notification of recognition
          as a KSE for the taxation year of 2019 in the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Accordingly, Alibaba
          Beijing, which had applied an EIT rate of 12.5% for the taxation year of 2019, reflected the reduction in
          tax rate to 10% for the taxation year of 2019 in the consolidated income statement for the year ended
          March 31, 2021.

     The total tax adjustments for Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China, Alibaba Beijing and certain other
     PRC subsidiaries of the Company, amounting to RMB4,656 million, RMB4,144 million and RMB6,085 million,
     were recorded in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,
     respectively.

     The annual review and notification relating to the renewal of the KSE status for the taxation year of 2020
     has not yet been obtained as of March 31, 2021. Accordingly, Alibaba China, Taobao China and Tmall
     China continued to apply an EIT rate of 15% for the taxation year of 2020 as High and New Technology
     Enterprises, and Alibaba Beijing applied an EIT rate of 12.5% (50% reduction in the standard statutory rate)
     for the taxation year 2020 as a Software Enterprise.

     Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31,
     2019, 2020 and 2021.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report     325

      7.   Income tax expenses (Continued)

           Composition of income tax expenses (Continued)
           Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to their
           foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with at least
           25% equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the relevant requirements
           pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R. Since the equity holders
           of the major PRC subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies and meet the
           relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R.,
           the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are anticipated
           to be distributed. As of March 31, 2021, the Company has accrued the withholding tax on substantially
           all of the distributable earnings of the PRC subsidiaries, except for those undistributed earnings that the
           Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB195.3 billion.

           (i) Others primarily represents deferred tax assets for share-based awards, investments in equity method investees, equity
               securities and other investments, as well as accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under PRC tax laws.
           (ii) The related deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 were provided on the assumption that substantially all of
                the distributable earnings of PRC subsidiaries will be distributed as dividends, except for those undistributed earnings that
                the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB107.2 billion and RMB195.3 billion, respectively.
           (iii) Deferred tax liabilities for investments in equity method investees mainly includes the deferred tax effect on the gain in
                 relation to the receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group of RMB19.7 billion (Note 4(n)). Others primarily represents
                 deferred tax liabilities for investments in equity securities and other investments.

           Valuation allowances provided on the deferred tax assets mainly related to the tax losses carried forward
           due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization. If events occur in the future that improve the certainty
           of realization, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will be made and consequently income tax
           expenses will be reduced.

      8.   Share-based awards
           Share-based awards such as RSUs, incentive and non-statutory stock options, restricted shares, dividend
           equivalents, share appreciation rights and share payments may be granted to any directors, employees
           and consultants of the Company or affiliated companies under equity incentive plans adopted since the
           inception of the Company. Currently, the 2014 Post-IPO Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”), which was
           adopted in September 2014 and has a ten-year term, is in effect and governs the terms of the awards. If an
           award under the previous plan terminates, expires or lapses, or is canceled for any reason, ordinary shares
           subject to the award become available for the grant of a new award under the 2014 Plan. Starting from
           April 1, 2015 and on each anniversary thereof, an additional amount equal to the lesser of (A) 200,000,000
           ordinary shares (previously 25,000,000 ordinary shares before the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note
           2(a)), and (B) such lesser number of ordinary shares as determined by the board of directors becomes
           available for the grant of a new award under the 2014 Plan. All share-based awards granted under the
           2014 Plan are subject to dilution protection should the capital structure of the Company be affected by a
           share split, reverse share split, share dividend or other dilutive action. As of March 31, 2021, the number of
           shares authorized but unissued was 276,575,864 ordinary shares.

           Share-based awards granted are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the
           administrator of the plans. Depending on the nature and the purpose of the grant, share-based awards
           generally vest 25% or 50% upon the first or second anniversary of the vesting commencement date,
           respectively, as provided in the award agreements, and 25% every year thereafter. Share-based awards
           granted to the senior management members of the Company are generally subject to a vesting period
           of up to six years. No outstanding share-based awards will be vested or exercisable after the expiry of a
           period of up to ten years from the date of grant.

           Following the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change that became effective on July 30, 2019 as
           detailed in Note 2(a), each ordinary share was subdivided into eight ordinary shares and each ADS
           represents eight ordinary shares. Pro-rata adjustments have been made to the number of ordinary shares
           underlying each RSU and share option granted, so as to give the participants the same proportion of the
           equity that they would have been entitled to prior to the Share Subdivision. Prior to July 30, 2019, one
           ordinary share was issuable upon the vesting of one outstanding RSU or the exercise of one outstanding
           share option, respectively. Subsequent to the Share Subdivision, eight ordinary shares are issuable upon
           the vesting of one outstanding RSU or the exercise of one outstanding share option, respectively. The Share
           Subdivision has no impact on the number of RSUs, the number of share options, the weighted average
           grant date fair value per RSU and the weighted average exercise price per share option as stated below.

      8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

           (b) Share options relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
                As of March 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options was RMB5,405 million.
                As of the same date, the aggregate intrinsic value of options that were vested and exercisable
                and options that were vested and expected to vest was RMB4,518 million and RMB5,355 million,
                respectively.

                During the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the weighted average grant date fair value
                of share options granted was nil, US$57.33 and nil, respectively, and the total grant date fair value
                of options vested during the same years was RMB311 million, RMB295 million and RMB335 million,
                respectively. During the same years, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options exercised was
                RMB708 million, RMB1,011 million and RMB468 million, respectively.

                Cash received from option exercises under the share option plans for the years ended March 31, 2019,
                2020 and 2021 was RMB220 million, RMB960 million and RMB205 million, respectively.

                No share options were granted during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2021. The fair value of
                each option granted during the year ended March 31, 2020 is estimated on the date of grant using the
                Black-Scholes model by applying the assumptions below:

                                                                                                                  Year ended March 31,
                                                                                                                                       2020
                 Risk-free interest rate (i)                                                                                          1.68%
                 Expected dividend yield (ii)                                                                                             0%
                 Expected life (years) (iii)                                                                                            4.50
                 Expected volatility (iv)                                                                                             34.7%

                (i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
                    life of the share options in effect at the time of grant.
                (ii) Expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its
                     ordinary shares.
                (iii) Expected life of share options is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise of share options.
                (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company and the Company’s comparable
                     companies in the period equal to the expected life of each grant.

                As of March 31, 2021, there were RMB143 million of unamortized compensation costs related to
                these outstanding share options, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to
                the awards granted to non-employees before the adoption of ASU 2018-07 on April 1, 2019. These
                amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

                During the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized share-based
                compensation expense of RMB181 million, RMB140 million and RMB159 million, respectively, in
                connection with the above share options.

8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

     (c) Partner Capital Investment Plan relating to ordinary shares of the Company
         Beginning in 2013, the Company offered selected members of the Alibaba Partnership rights or
         interests to acquire restricted shares of the Company. For the rights or interests offered before 2016,
         these rights or interests and the underlying restricted shares were subject to a non-compete provision,
         and each right or interest entitles the holder to purchase eight restricted shares at an aggregate price
         of US$14.50, after the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a), during a four-year period. Upon the
         exercise of the rights or interests, the underlying ordinary shares may not be transferred for a period
         of eight years from the date of subscription of the relevant rights or interests. For the rights or interests
         offered since 2016, the rights or interests and the underlying restricted shares were subject to certain
         service provisions that were not related to employment, and each right or interest entitles the holder
         to purchase eight restricted shares at an aggregate price between US$23.00 and US$26.00, after the
         Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a), over a period of ten years from the vesting commencement
         date.

         As of March 31, 2021, the number of ordinary shares underlying these rights or interests is 149,957,904
         shares, of which 24,889,472 shares underlying these rights or interests were available for offering. The
         rights or interests offered before 2016 were accounted for as noncontrolling interests of the Company
         as these rights or interests were issued by the Company’s subsidiaries and classified as equity at the
         subsidiary level. The rights or interests offered in the subsequent periods were accounted for as share
         options issued by the Company.

         As of March 31, 2021, there were RMB452 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
         rights or interests, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to the awards
         granted to non-employees before the adoption of ASU 2018-07 on April 1, 2019. These amounts are
         expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.0 years. Share-based compensation
         expense of RMB409 million, RMB425 million and RMB224 million was recognized in connection with
         these rights or interests for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

         No rights or interests were granted during the year ended March 31, 2021. The fair value of each right
         or interest to acquire restricted shares during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 is estimated
         on the subscription date using the Black-Scholes model by applying the assumptions below:

                                                                                                      Year ended March 31,
                                                                                                            2019                   2020

          Expected life (years) (iii)                                                                       8.25                   8.25
          Expected volatility (iv)                                                                        33.0%                33.1%

         (i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
             life of the share-based awards in effect at the time of grant.
         (ii) Expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its
              ordinary shares.
         (iii) Expected life of the rights or interests is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise of the rights or
               interests.
         (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company’s comparable companies in the period
              equal to expected life of each right or interest.

      8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

           (d) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group
                Since March 2014, Hangzhou Junhan Equity Investment Partnership (“Junhan”), a major equity holder
                of Ant Group, has granted share-based awards tied to the valuation of Ant Group to the employees
                of the Company, which will be settled by Junhan upon disposal of these awards by the holders.
                Since April 2018 and July 2019, Ant Group has granted RSUs and share appreciation rights tied to
                the valuation of Ant Group, respectively, to the employees of the Company, both of which will be
                settled by Ant Group upon vesting or exercise of these awards. In addition, Junhan and Ant Group
                have the right to repurchase the vested awards (or any underlying equity for the settlement of the
                vested awards) granted by them, as applicable, from the holders upon an initial public offering of Ant
                Group or the termination of the holders’ employment with the Company at a price to be determined
                based on the then fair market value of Ant Group. These awards are generally subject to a four-year
                vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the plan. Depending on the nature and the
                purpose of the grant, these awards generally vest 25% or 50% upon the first or second anniversary of
                the vesting commencement date, respectively, as provided in the award agreements, and 25% every
                year thereafter. Awards granted to the senior management members of the Company are generally
                subject to a vesting period of up to six years.

                For accounting purposes, these awards meet the definition of a financial derivative. The cost
                relating to these awards is recognized by the Company and the related expense is recognized over
                the requisite service period in the consolidated income statements with a corresponding credit to
                additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these awards are recorded in the
                consolidated income statements. The expenses relating to the awards granted by Junhan are re-
                measured at the fair value on each reporting date until their settlement dates. The expenses relating
                to the awards granted by Ant Group are re-measured at the fair value on each reporting date until
                their vesting dates or settlement dates.

                During the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized expenses of
                RMB12,855 million, RMB1,261 million and RMB17,315 million, respectively, in respect of the share-
                based awards relating to Ant Group.

                Subsequent to the Company’s initial public offering in 2014, the Company, Junhan and Ant Group
                agreed that none of them had any obligations to pay any other party any expense relating to the
                cross-grant of share-based awards. Starting from April 2020, the parties agreed to settle with each
                other the cost associated with certain share-based awards granted to each other’s employees upon
                vesting. The settlement amounts under this arrangement depend on the values of Ant Group share-
                based awards granted to the Company’s employees and the Company’s share-based awards granted
                to employees of Ant Group, in which the net settlement amount is insignificant to the Company.

9.   Earnings per share/ADS
     Following the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change as detailed in Note 2(a), each ordinary share
     was subdivided into eight ordinary shares and each ADS represents eight ordinary shares. The weighted
     average number of ordinary shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share/ADS
     for the year ended March 31, 2019 have been retrospectively adjusted.

     Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
     weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, adjusted for treasury shares. Basic earnings per
     ADS is derived from the basic earnings per share after the ADS Ratio Change.

     For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic
     earnings per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including share-based awards, under the
     treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities, of which the amounts are insignificant, have been
     excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted
     earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per share after the ADS Ratio Change.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share/ADS for the
     following periods:

                                                                                         Year ended March 31,

   2020 and 2021 were RMB80,939 million and RMB96,946 million, respectively.

   For equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative as of March 31, 2020, the

   for which the fair value as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 were RMB4,704 million and RMB11,343 million,
   respectively. The aggregate fair value of these convertible and exchangeable bonds was (lower) higher
   than their aggregate unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 by RMB(1,576) million and
   RMB90 million, respectively. Unrealized gains (losses) recorded on these convertible and exchangeable
   bonds in the consolidated income statements were RMB44 million, RMB(1,651) million and RMB1,573

   due to the fact that the related effective interest rates approximate rates currently offered by financial
   institutions for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

      12. Fair value measurement
           Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
           orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability
           of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to
           measure fair value:

           Level 1   —    Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
                          markets.
           Level 2   —    Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as
                          quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
                          or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are
                          observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
           Level 3   —    Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions, consistent with reasonably
                          available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require
                          significant judgment.


           Fair value of listed equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
           liabilities. Certain other financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts and certain option
           agreements, are valued based on inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
           Valuations of convertible and exchangeable bonds that do not have a quoted price are generally
           performed using valuation models such as the binomial model with unobservable inputs including
           risk-free interest rate and expected volatility. The valuation of contingent consideration is performed
           using an expected cash flow method with unobservable inputs including the probability to achieve
           the contingencies, which is assessed by the Company, in connection with the contingent consideration
           arrangements. Investments in privately held companies for which the Company elected to record using the
           measurement alternative are re-measured on a non-recurring basis, and are categorized within Level 3
           under the fair value hierarchy. The values are estimated based on valuation methods using the observable
           transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, as well as
           rights and obligations of the securities.

                   ended March 31, 2020, additions were primarily related to the 33% equity interest in Ant Group received pursuant to the

           (ii)    Share of results, other comprehensive income and other reserves include the share of results of the equity method
                   investees, the gain or loss arising from the deemed disposal of the equity method investees and the amortization of basis
                   differences. The amount excludes the expenses relating to the share-based awards underlying the equity of the Company
                   and Ant Group granted to employees of certain equity method investees.
           (iii)   During the year ended March 31, 2020, transfers were primarily related to the deconsolidation of the Company’s AliExpress
                   Russia businesses, which were contributed to the AliExpress Russia Joint Venture (Note 4(m)).

           (iv)    Impairment loss recorded represents other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of the
                   investments in equity method investees. The valuation inputs for the fair value measurement with respect to the
                   impairments include the stock price for equity method investees that are listed, as well as certain unobservable inputs that
                   are not subject to meaningful aggregation.

   (i)    During the year ended March 31, 2020, additions under the core commerce segment primarily included the acquisition of
          Kaola (Note 4(b)).
          During the year ended March 31, 2021, additions under the core commerce segment primarily included the acquisition of
          Sun Art (Note 4(a)).
   (ii)   During the year ended March 31, 2020, measurement period adjustments under the digital media and entertainment
          segment were primarily related to the adjustments to the fair value of intangible assets and certain other net assets
          acquired from the acquisition of Alibaba Pictures (Note 4(c)).

   Gross goodwill balances were RMB281,302 million and RMB297,250 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2021,
   respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were RMB4,520 million and RMB4,479 million as of March 31,
   2020 and 2021, respectively.

   In the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of
   certain reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and recorded impairment losses of nil, RMB576
   million and nil during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The impairment losses
   were resulted from a revision of long-term financial outlook and the change in business model of those
   reporting units. The goodwill impairment is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information
   (Note 26) because the CODM of the Company does not consider this as part of the segment operating
   performance measure.

      18. Deferred revenue and customer advances
           Deferred revenue and customer advances primarily represent service fees prepaid by merchants or
           customers for which the relevant services have not been provided. The respective balances are as follows:

                                                                                             As of March 31,
                                                                                              2020                2021

            Deferred revenue                                                                23,195             30,508
            Customer advances                                                               17,168             35,139
                                                                                            40,363             65,647
            Less: current portion                                                           (38,338)        (62,489)
            Non-current portion                                                               2,025               3,158


           All service fees received in advance are initially recorded as customer advances. These amounts are
           transferred to deferred revenue upon commencement of the provision of services by the Company and
           are recognized in the consolidated income statements in the period in which the services are provided. In
           general, service fees received in advance are non-refundable after the amounts are transferred to deferred
           revenue. Substantially all of the balances of deferred revenue and customer advances are generally
           recognized as revenue within one year.

      20. Bank borrowings
           Bank borrowings are analyzed as follows:

                                                                                                                As of March 31
                                                                                                                  2020               2021
                                                                                                              (in millions of RMB)
             Current portion:
             Short-term other borrowings (i)                                                                     5,154               3,606
             Non-current portion:
             US$4.0 billion syndicated loan denominated in US$ (ii)                                             28,211             26,153
             Long-term other borrowings (iii)                                                                   11,449             12,182
                                                                                                                39,660             38,335

           (i)     As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had short-term borrowings from banks which were repayable within one
                   year or on demand and charged interest rates ranging from 0.9% to 16.5% and 0.6% to 12.5% per annum, respectively.
                   As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the weighted average interest rate of these borrowings was 3.4% and 2.9% per annum,
                   respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB or HK$.
           (ii)    As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had a five-year US$4.0 billion syndicated loan, which was entered into with
                   a group of eight lead arrangers. The loan has a five-year bullet maturity and was priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR.
                   Certain related floating interest payments are hedged by certain interest rate swap contracts entered into by the Company.
                   The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions). In May
                   2019, the loan terms were modified such that the interest rate of the loan was reduced to 85 basis points over LIBOR and
                   the maturity of the loan was extended to May 2024.
           (iii)   As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had long-term borrowings from banks with weighted average interest rates
                   of 4.4% and 4.3% per annum, respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB.

           Certain other bank borrowings are collateralized by a pledge of certain buildings and property
           improvements, construction in progress and land use rights in the PRC with carrying values of RMB18,744
           million and RMB18,365 million, as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, the
           Company is in compliance with all covenants in relation to bank borrowings.

           In April 2017, the Company obtained a revolving credit facility provided by certain financial institutions for
           an amount of US$5.15 billion, which has not yet been drawn down. The interest rate on any outstanding
           utilized amount under this credit facility was calculated based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. This facility
           is reserved for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions). In June 2021, the
           terms of this credit facility were amended and the amount of the credit facility was increased to US$6.5
           billion. The expiration date of the credit facility was extended to June 2026. Under the amended terms of
           the credit facility, the interest rate on any outstanding utilized amount will be calculated based on LIBOR
           plus 80 basis points.

           As of March 31, 2021, the borrowings will be due according to the following schedule:

                                                                                                                      Principal amounts
                                                                                                                    (in millions of RMB)
             Within 1 year                                                                                                           3,606

                                                             For the Years Ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021




23. Restricted net assets
    PRC laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the
    PRC only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards
    and regulations. In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are required to annually
    appropriate 10% of their net income to the statutory reserve prior to payment of any dividends, unless the
    reserve has reached 50% of their respective registered capital. Furthermore, registered share capital and
    capital reserve accounts are also restricted from distribution. As a result of the restrictions described above
    and elsewhere under PRC laws and regulations, the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are
    restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company in the form of dividends.
    The restriction amounted to RMB160,133 million as of March 31, 2021. Except for the above or disclosed
    elsewhere, there is no other restriction on the use of proceeds generated by the Company’s subsidiaries to
    satisfy any obligations of the Company.

24. Commitments

    (a) Capital commitments
         Capital expenditures contracted for are analyzed as follows:

                                                                                          As of March 31,
                                                                                           2020                2021
                                                                                        (in millions of RMB)

         combinations and equity investments under various arrangements as of March 31, 2020 and
         2021, respectively. The commitment balance as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 primarily includes the
         consideration for the investment in Focus Media (Note 4(p)) and the remaining committed capital of
         certain investment funds.

    (c) Other commitments
         The Company also has other commitments including commitments for co-location and bandwidth
         fees, licensed copyrights and marketing expenses. These commitments are analyzed as follows:

                                                                                          As of March 31,
                                                                                           2020                2021
                                                                                        (in millions of RMB)
          No later than 1 year                                                           27,398             35,109
          Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years                                    19,261             17,266
          More than 5 years                                                                3,102               2,849

      24. Commitments (Continued)

           (c) Other commitments (Continued)
                 As a marketing initiative, the Company entered into a framework agreement with the International
                 Olympic Committee (the “IOC”) and the United States Olympic Committee in January 2017 for a long-
                 term partnership arrangement through 2028. Joining in The Olympic Partner worldwide sponsorship
                 program, the Company has become the official “E-Commerce Services” Partner and “Cloud Services”
                 Partner of the IOC. In addition, the Company has been granted certain marketing rights, benefits
                 and opportunities relating to future Olympic Games and related initiatives, events and activities. The
                 Company committed to provide at least US$815 million worth of cash, cloud infrastructure services
                 and cloud computing services, as well as marketing and media support in connection with various
                 Olympic initiatives, events and activities, including the Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games
                 through 2028.

      25. Risks and contingencies
           (a)   The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and considered as a foreign entity under PRC
                 laws. Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
                 added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
                 the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses through various contractual
                 arrangements with VIEs that are incorporated and 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities
                 owned and/or controlled by PRC citizens. The VIEs hold the licenses and approvals that are essential
                 for their business operations in the PRC and the Company has entered into various agreements with
                 the VIEs and their equity holders such that the Company has the right to benefit from their licenses
                 and approvals and generally has control of the VIEs. In the Company’s opinion, the current ownership
                 structure and the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders as well as the
                 operations of the VIEs are in substantial compliance with all existing PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                 However, there may be changes and other developments in PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                 Accordingly, the Company gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view
                 in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of
                 the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found
                 to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct
                 its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership
                 structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in
                 deconsolidation of the VIEs.

           (b)   The PRC market in which the Company operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks
                 and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of the Company to operate or invest in
                 online and mobile commerce or other Internet related businesses, representing the principal services
                 provided by the Company, in the PRC. The information and technology industries are highly regulated.
                 Restrictions are currently in place or are unclear regarding what specific segments of these industries
                 foreign owned enterprises, like the Company, may operate. If new or more extensive restrictions
                 were imposed on the segments in which the Company is permitted to operate, the Company could
                 be required to sell or cease to operate or invest in some or all of its current businesses in the PRC.
                 These uncertainties also extend to the PRC’s regulations relating to anti-monopoly and unfair
                 competition. In December 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation of the PRC (the “SAMR”)
                 commenced an investigation on the Company pursuant to the PRC Anti-monopoly Law. Following the
                 investigation, in April 2021, the SAMR issued an administrative penalty decision of the anti-monopoly
                 investigation into the Company and imposed a fine of RMB18.2 billion (Note 19), which was accrued
                 for as of March 31, 2021. The SAMR also issued an administrative guidance, instructing the Company
                 to implement a comprehensive rectification program, and to file a self-assessment and compliance
                 report to the SAMR for three consecutive years.

25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (c)   PRC regulators have recently enhanced their scrutiny over financial technology, or fintech, businesses,
         and have proposed or promulgated several new measures and rules to strengthen regulations
         over certain financial industries in which Ant Group operates, such as digital payment, wealth
         management, micro financing and insurance. Recently, Ant Group has also been in discussions with
         PRC regulators about its business. In December 2020, Ant Group announced that it would establish
         a rectification working group and bring the operation and development of its finance-related
         businesses in line with regulatory requirements. In April 2021, Ant Group announced that under the
         regulators’ guidance, and in accordance with regulatory requirements, Ant Group had completed the
         formulation of its rectification plan, according to which Ant Group would apply to set up a financial
         holding company to ensure its financial-related businesses are fully regulated. To implement the
         rectification plan and comply with applicable new measures and rules, Ant Group may be required
         to spend significant time and resources and make changes to its businesses. As a result of regulatory
         developments, Ant Group’s business operations and growth prospects could be materially and
         adversely affected. Given that Ant Group offers a variety of services and products that have become
         essential parts of the services and experience the Company offers to consumers and merchants on the
         Company’s platforms, rectification and other regulatory requirements placed on Ant Group could in
         turn have a material adverse effect on the Company.

   (d)   The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its indebtedness. The Company also has
         interest bearing assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted
         cash. Certain of the Company’s indebtedness carries floating interest rates based on a spread over
         LIBOR. As a result, the interest expenses associated with these indebtedness will be subject to the
         potential impact of any fluctuation in LIBOR. The Company uses derivatives, such as interest rate
         swaps, to manage its interest rate exposure, and has entered into various agreements with various
         financial institutions as counterparties to swap a certain portion of its floating interest rate debt to
         effectively become fixed interest rate debt. Uncertainties surrounding changes to the basis on which
         LIBOR is calculated or the phase-out of LIBOR, which may cause a sudden and prolonged increase or
         decrease in LIBOR, could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and financial condition, as
         well as the Company’s cash flows. In addition, once LIBOR is not available, the Company may need to
         further negotiate with its lenders to agree on an alternative basis of interest, which may result in an
         interest rate differing from the Company’s expectations and could materially affect the cost of these
         facilities to the Company.

   (e)   The Company’s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a
         significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely
         convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to
         be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People’s Bank of
         China (the “PBOC”).

         Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in the PRC must be processed through the
         PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory bodies and require certain supporting documentation
         in order to effect the remittance. If the foreign exchange control system prevents the Company from
         obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able
         to pay dividends in foreign currencies and the Company’s ability to fund its business activities that are
         conducted in foreign currencies could be adversely affected.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report     353

      25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
           (f)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes strategic investments to increase the service
                 offerings and expand capabilities. The Company continually reviews its investments to determine
                 whether there is a decline in fair value below the carrying value. Fair value of the listed securities is
                 subject to volatility and may be materially affected by market fluctuations.

           (g)   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk
                 consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and equity
                 securities and other investments. As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Company’s
                 cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash were held by major financial
                 institutions located worldwide, including mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R. If the banking system
                 or the financial markets deteriorate or become volatile, the financial institutions and other issuers
                 of financial instruments held by the Company could become insolvent and the markets for these
                 instruments could become illiquid, in which case the Company could lose some or all of the value of
                 its investments.

           (h)   During the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company offered a trade assurance
                 program on the international wholesale marketplaces at no charge to the wholesale buyers and
                 sellers. If the wholesale sellers who participate in this program do not deliver the products in their
                 stated specifications to the wholesale buyers on schedule, the Company may compensate the
                 wholesale buyers for their losses on behalf of the wholesale sellers up to a pre-determined amount
                 following a review of each particular case. In turn, the Company will seek a full reimbursement
                 from the wholesale sellers for the prepaid reimbursement amount, yet the Company is exposed
                 to a risk over the collectibility of the reimbursement from the wholesale sellers. During the years
                 ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company did not incur any material losses with respect
                 to the compensation provided under this program. Given that the maximum compensation for each
                 wholesale seller is pre-determined based on their individual risk assessments by the Company
                 considering their credit profile or other relevant information, the Company determined that the
                 likelihood of material default on the payments are not probable and therefore no provisions have
                 been made in relation to this program.

           (i)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
                 and litigations in relation to disputes relating to trademarks and other intellectual property, among
                 others. In 2017, Beijing Jingdong Shiji Trading Co., Ltd. and Beijing Jingdong 360 E-commerce Co., Ltd.
                 sued Tmall China, Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Limited for abuse of
                 dominant market position. The plaintiffs requested the three defendants to cease relevant acts and
                 claimed a substantial amount of damages in the original complaint. In March 2021, the plaintiffs
                 amended their claim to seek higher damages. The case is pending in Beijing High People’s Court
                 and the potential damages are not reasonably estimable at the current stage. There are no legal
                 proceedings and litigations that have in the recent past had, or to the Company’s knowledge, are
                 probable to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial positions, results of operations or
                 cash flows. The Company did not accrue any material loss contingencies in this respect as of March
                 31, 2020 and 2021.

25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (j)   The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant negative impact on the
         global economy, which has adversely affected the Company’s business and financial results.
         Starting in late January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a series of lock-downs, social
         distancing requirements and travel restrictions that drastically reduced business activities in China.
         This substantial decline in business activities in China negatively affected most of the Company’s
         domestic core commerce businesses, including the Company’s China retail marketplaces and Local
         Consumer Services business, as well as other businesses that involve travel, transportation and offline
         entertainment, such as Fliggy, Alibaba Pictures (Note 4(c)), Damai and Amap. The Company’s key
         international commerce businesses also experienced a negative impact. The COVID-19 pandemic also
         presented and may continue to present challenges to the Company’s business operations as well as
         the business operations of the Company’s merchants, business partners and other participants in the
         Company’s ecosystem, such as closure of offices and facilities, disruptions to or even suspensions of
         normal business and logistics operations, as well as restrictions on travel. Although the Company’s
         businesses have recovered or are starting to recover, it is not possible to determine the ultimate
         impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business operations and financial results, which
         is highly dependent on numerous factors, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and
         any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China or elsewhere, actions taken by governments,
         domestically and in international relations, the response of businesses and individuals to the
         pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on business and economic conditions in China and globally,
         consumer demand, the Company’s ability and the ability of merchants, retailers, logistics service
         providers and other participants in the Company’s ecosystem to continue operations in areas affected
         by the pandemic and the Company’s efforts and expenditures to support merchants and partners and
         ensure the safety of the Company’s employees. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely
         affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

      26. Segment information
           The Company presents segment information after elimination of inter-company transactions. In general,
           revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses are directly attributable, or are allocated, to each
           segment. The Company allocates costs and expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific
           segment, such as those that support infrastructure across different segments, to different segments mainly
           on the basis of usage, revenue or headcount, depending on the nature of the relevant costs and expenses.
           The Company does not allocate assets to its segments as the CODM does not evaluate the performance of
           segments using asset information.

           The following tables present the summary of each segment’s revenue, income from operations and
           adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Adjusted EBITA”) which is considered as a
           segment operating performance measure, for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021:
