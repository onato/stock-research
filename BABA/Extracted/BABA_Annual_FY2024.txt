                Our founders started our company to champion small businesses, in the belief that the
                Internet would level the playing field by enabling small enterprises to leverage innovation
                and technology to grow and compete more effectively in domestic and global economies. We
                believe that concentrating on customer needs and solving their problems — whether those
                customers are consumers, merchants or enterprises — ultimately will lead to the best outcome
                for our business. In the digital era, we are staying true to our mission by helping our customers
                and business partners harness the power of digital technology. We have developed a large
                ecosystem powered by technology infrastructure that enables participants to create and share
                value on our platforms. Our decisions are guided by how they serve our mission over the long
                term, not by the pursuit of short-term gains.

     First, we take a long-term perspective when making hard decisions. We think in 10-year cycles as the
     development cadence of technology businesses typically experience the phases of investment, growth, harvest,         First, as technology pioneers, we are interested in exploring the potential of machine intelligence to achieve

                                                                                                                          generate substantial free cash flows from their core business. Alibaba has a market-leading proprietary LLM,

     Second, we apply extreme focus and intentionality in everything we do. Focus means we are not distracted by
     unimportant things, and in determining what is important or not, we are unemotional when facing hard choices.
     Intentionality means we develop sound reasons for doing what we do. For example, Alibaba Cloud’s pivot to            Second, investment in LLMs drives the growth of our cloud computing business as the training and usage of LLMs

     based business.                                                                                                      resource needs. We also have China’s largest open-source LLM community, ModelScope, which includes third-

     Last but not least, we communicate a clear direction to our teams and seek alignment from them by setting
     sound incentive systems. We believe that transparency of strategic direction and demonstration of intentionality
     from company leaders make a more productive and happier workforce. We have developed employee incentive              Third, Alibaba is an integral part of the consumer economy. The user experience within our multitude of consumer

                                 factory jointly with her friends several years ago. The business focused on
                                 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) production and offline wholesale of
                                 women’s footwear. In its business operations, Qiu faced challenges relating

                                 issues. Qiu and her brother took advantage of the livestreaming trend and
                                 started livestreaming on Taobao to sell their products directly to consumers.
                                 Qiu capitalized on her wholesale cost basis and inventory advantages to offer
                                 value-for-money and high-quality products directly to consumers. With her

     products for pet owners

     Pet products have emerged as a growing consumer trend in recent
     years. Given the fierce competition landscape, it is difficult to stand
     out. Di Zhang, founder of seedshub, saw that pet-focused brands
     mainly catered to the daily food and basic needs of pets, often
     overlooking pet owners’ unique household cleaning requirements.
     Di Zhang founded seedshub with a consumer-oriented approach to
     create a specialized cleaning and care brand for pet-owning families.
     Using Tmall’s comprehensive consumer and market insights, seedshub
     has successfully introduced specialized cleaning products such as
     liquid laundry detergent, laundry detergent pod, and disinfectant
     tailored for families with pets.


     For the long-term steady development of the brand, seedshub has
     joined Tmall's new brand support plan, which allows it to target
     a specific group of pet consumers. As part of the plan, the
     membership program on Tmall helps brands enhance
     consumer mind share and improve user growth and

company based in Shengze, Suzhou, has been in the apparel
business for over a decade. In 2019, his business hit a bottleneck, but
he found new life after the discovery of Alibaba.com. The platform
allowed him to garner insights and unlock opportunities in the niche
market for clothing made of recycled materials.


To encourage exporters that focus on manufacturing products with
recycled materials, Alibaba.com provides their online storefronts
with additional customer traffic. While the cost of recycled materials
is generally higher, a community of global buyers on Alibaba.com
is willing to pay the premium, presenting more potential business
opportunities to exporters in this sector. Currently, the recycled
materials used in Pan's clothing production are not limited to plastic
bottles. They also include coffee grounds, fishing nets, oyster shells,
and other marine waste.

market opportunities
Zhuocheng Cai, Product Director of Guangzhou Qiancheng Trading
Co., Ltd, is an experienced seller on AliExpress. Seven years ago, he
and a few partners started their own brand with the vision to develop
a portable, smart water purifier that would meet European and
American consumer aesthetic preferences. He soon recognized that
the success of a brand hinges not only on product quality and design
but also on providing an exceptional logistics customer experience.

The “5-Day Delivery” and other express delivery services introduced
by Cainiao and AliExpress have boosted the growth of his brand.
Many customers can now receive their products in less than a
week after placing an order, which leads to enhanced customer
satisfaction and rapid sales growth. Cainiao’s efficient logistics
services not only give their products a competitive advantage but
also foster repeat purchases from customers.

      basis for investors to evaluate the assets, operations
      and overall significance of the variable interest
      entities as a group, as well as the nature and amounts
      associated with intercompany transactions. The large
      number of variable interest entities not included as
      major variable interest entities are individually, and in
      the aggregate, not material for our company taken as
      a whole. To include them in the presentation would
      require tremendous time and efforts to prepare
      condensed consolidating schedules for them,
      which we do not believe would provide meaningful
      additional information to investors.

of any committee, the 2014 Plan will be administered

Other Information
The directors of Alibaba Group Holding Limited are responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises all of the information included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements
and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Directors and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
The directors of Alibaba Group Holding Limited are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern for one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are available to be
issued.

The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not
assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report   261
      Independent Auditor’s Report


      As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
      scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

      •    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
           due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
           evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
           a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
           involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

      •    Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
           are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
           of the Company’s internal control.

      •    Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
           and related disclosures made by the directors.

      •    Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
           on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
           that may cast substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
           that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
           disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
           opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
           However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

      •    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
           the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
           and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

      •    Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
           business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
           We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
           responsible for our audit opinion.

      We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
      the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
      during our audit.

      We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
      regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
      reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats
      or safeguards applied.

      From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most
      significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
      key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
      disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be
      communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
      outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

      The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Shin Wai Kit Ricky.

                                                             (For the Years Ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024)



2.   Summary of significant accounting policies

     (a) Basis of presentation
         The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

         Translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement,
         consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows from
         RMB into the US$ as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024 are solely for the convenience of the
         readers and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.2203, representing the exchange rate set
         forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 29, 2024. No representation
         is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at
         this rate, or at any other rate.

     (b) Use of estimates
         The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
         the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
         statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The
         Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
         believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
         carrying values of assets and liabilities.

     (c) Consolidation
         The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its
         subsidiaries, which include the PRC-registered entities directly or indirectly owned by the Company
         (“WFOEs”) and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) over which the Company is the primary beneficiary
         for accounting purposes only. All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries and
         the VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
         are recorded in the consolidated income statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the
         effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

         A subsidiary is an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the
         voting power; or (ii) the Company has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members
         of the board of directors or to cast a majority of votes at the meetings of the board of directors or
         to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee pursuant to a statute or under an
         agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. A VIE is required to be consolidated by the
         primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity holders in the entity do not have the characteristics
         of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
         activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

         Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
         added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
         the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment
         is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through various contractual arrangements with VIEs that are
         incorporated and owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by PRC citizens.
         Specifically, these representative PRC domestic companies are Zhejiang Taobao Network Co., Ltd.,
         Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Ali Venture Capital Co., Ltd., Shanghai Rajax Information
         Technology Co., Ltd., Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd. and Alibaba Culture Entertainment Co., Ltd.
         The registered capital of these PRC domestic companies was funded by the Company through loans
         extended to the equity holders of these PRC domestic companies.



                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report    275

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (c) Consolidation (Continued)
                The Company has entered into certain exclusive services agreements with these PRC domestic
                companies, which entitle it to receive substantially all of the profits of the VIEs. In addition, the
                Company has entered into certain agreements with the equity holders of these PRC domestic
                companies, including loan agreements that require them to contribute registered capital to those
                PRC domestic companies, exclusive call option agreements to acquire the equity interests in these
                companies when permitted by the PRC laws, rules and regulations, equity pledge agreements of
                the equity interests held by those equity holders, and proxy agreements that irrevocably authorize
                individuals designated by the Company to exercise the equity owner’s rights over these PRC domestic
                companies.

                Details of the typical structure of the Company’s representative VIEs are set forth below:

                Loan agreements
                Pursuant to the relevant loan agreements, the respective WFOEs have granted loans to the equity
                holders of the VIEs, which may only be used for the purpose of its business operation activities
                agreed by the WFOEs or the acquisition of the relevant VIEs. The WFOEs may require acceleration of
                repayment at their absolute discretion. When the equity holders of the VIEs make early repayment
                of the outstanding amount, the WFOEs or a third-party designated by the WFOEs may purchase the
                equity interests in the VIEs at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the loan, subject to any
                applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. The equity holders of the VIEs undertake not to enter into
                any prohibited transactions in relation to the VIEs, including the transfer of any business, material
                assets or equity interests in the VIEs to any third party.

                Exclusive call option agreements
                The equity holders of the VIEs have granted the WFOEs exclusive call options to purchase their equity
                interest in the VIEs at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the
                VIEs; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each relevant VIE has further
                granted the relevant WFOE an exclusive call option to purchase its assets at an exercise price equal
                to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws, whichever
                is higher. Certain VIEs and their equity holders will also jointly grant the WFOEs (A) exclusive call
                options to request the VIEs to decrease their registered capital at an exercise price equal to the higher
                of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the VIEs and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable
                PRC laws (the “Capital Decrease Price”), and (B) exclusive call options to subscribe for any increased
                capital of the VIEs at a price equal to the Capital Decrease Price, or the sum of the Capital Decrease
                Price and the unpaid registered capital, if applicable, as of the capital decrease. The WFOEs may
                nominate another entity or individual to purchase the equity interest or assets, or to subscribe for
                the increased capital, if applicable, under the call options. Execution of each call option shall not
                violate the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Each equity holder of the VIE has agreed that
                the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed
                to the VIE (after deduction of relevant tax expenses), belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs: (i)
                proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIE, (ii) proceeds received in connection with a
                capital decrease in the VIE, and (iii) distributions or liquidation residuals from the disposal of its equity
                interests in the VIE upon termination or liquidation. Moreover, any profits, distributions or dividends
                (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) received by the VIEs also belong to and shall be paid to the
                WFOEs. The exclusive call option agreements remain in effect until the equity interest or assets that
                are the subject of these agreements are transferred to the WFOEs.

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         Proxy agreements
         Pursuant to the relevant proxy agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs irrevocably authorize any
         person designated by the WFOEs to exercise their rights of the equity holders of the VIEs, including
         without limitation the right to vote and appoint directors.

         Equity pledge agreements
         Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs have pledged
         all of their interests in the equity of the VIEs as a continuing first priority security interest in favor of
         the corresponding WFOEs to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant loan
         agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the VIEs and/or the
         equity holders under the other structure contracts. Each WFOE is entitled to exercise its right to
         dispose of the pledged interests in the equity of the VIE held by the equity holders and has priority in
         receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of the pledged interests,
         in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other structure contracts, if
         applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until the later of (i) the full performance
         of the contractual arrangements by the relevant parties, and (ii) the full repayment of the loans made
         to the equity holders of the VIEs.

         Exclusive services agreements
         Each relevant VIE has entered into an exclusive services agreement with the respective WFOE,
         pursuant to which the relevant WFOE provides exclusive services to the VIE. In exchange, the VIE
         pays a service fee to the WFOE, the amount of which shall be determined, to the extent permitted by
         applicable PRC laws as proposed by the WFOE, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits
         from the VIE to the WFOE.

         Other arrangements
         The exclusive call option agreements described above also entitle the WFOEs to all profits,
         distributions or dividends (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by the equity
         holder of the VIEs, and the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital
         that they contributed to the VIEs (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by each
         equity holder of the VIEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIEs, (ii) proceeds
         received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIEs, and (iii) distributions or liquidation
         residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIEs upon termination or liquidation.

         Based on these contractual agreements, the Company believes that the PRC domestic companies as
         described above should be considered as VIEs because the equity holders do not have significant
         equity at risk nor do they have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Given that the
         Company is the primary beneficiary of these PRC domestic companies, the Company believes that
         these VIEs should be consolidated based on the structure as described above.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         The VIEs did not have any material related party transactions except for the related party transactions
         which are disclosed in Note 22 or elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, and those
         transactions with other subsidiaries that are not VIEs, which were eliminated upon consolidation.

         Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of
         the VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company
         considers that there is no asset in any of the VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the
         VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all VIEs are incorporated as limited
         liability companies under the Company Law of the corresponding jurisdictions, creditors of the VIEs do
         not have recourse to the general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the VIEs.

         Currently, there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional
         financial support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based
         on the licenses and approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to
         provide financial support to the VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs as well as the
         Company’s own business objectives in the future.

         Unrecognized revenue-producing assets held by the VIEs include certain Internet content provision
         and other licenses, domain names and trademarks. The Internet content provision and other licenses
         are required under relevant PRC laws, rules and regulations for the operation of Internet businesses
         in the PRC, and therefore are integral to the Company’s operations. The Internet content provision
         licenses require that core PRC trademark registrations and domain names are held by the VIEs that
         provide the relevant services.

     (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests
         The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting
         in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” The cost of an acquisition is measured as
         the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred to the sellers, liabilities
         incurred by the Company and equity instruments issued by the Company. Transaction costs directly
         attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
         assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the
         extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of
         the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in
         the acquiree over (ii) the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is
         recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the acquisition date amounts of the net
         assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income
         statements. During the measurement period, which can be up to one year from the acquisition
         date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the
         corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the conclusion of the measurement period or final
         determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any
         further adjustments are recorded in the consolidated income statements.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report   279

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests (Continued)
                In a business combination achieved in stages, the Company remeasures the previously held equity
                interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the
                remeasurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated income statements.

                When there is a change in ownership interests or a change in contractual arrangements that results in
                a loss of control of a subsidiary, the Company deconsolidates the subsidiary from the date control is
                lost. Any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and is
                included in the calculation of the gain or loss upon deconsolidation of the subsidiary.

                For the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to
                reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. When the
                noncontrolling interest is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of a conditional event, which
                is not solely within the control of the Company, the noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine
                equity. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date that
                it becomes probable that the mezzanine equity will become redeemable to the earliest redemption
                date using the effective interest method. Consolidated net income in the consolidated income
                statements includes net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and mezzanine equity
                holders when applicable.

                Net income attributable to mezzanine equity holders is included in net loss attributable to
                noncontrolling interests in the consolidated income statements, while it is excluded from the
                consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity. During the years ended March 31, 2022,
                2023 and 2024, net income attributable to mezzanine equity holders amounted to RMB188 million,
                RMB365 million and RMB181 million, respectively. The cumulative results of operations attributable to
                noncontrolling interests, along with adjustments for share-based compensation expense arising from
                outstanding share-based awards relating to subsidiaries’ shares, are also recorded as noncontrolling
                interests on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows related to transactions with
                noncontrolling interests are presented under financing activities in the consolidated statements of
                cash flows.

           (e) Segment reporting
                Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to
                the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), which is comprised of certain members of the
                Company’s management team. Prior to the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company had seven
                reportable segments, namely China commerce, International commerce, Local consumer services,
                Cainiao, Cloud, Digital media and entertainment, and Innovation initiatives and others segments.
                Starting from the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company has implemented a new organizational
                and governance structure, which includes six major business groups and various other businesses.
                Accordingly, the CODM started to review information under a new reporting structure, and segment
                reporting has been updated to conform to this change. Consequently, the Company presents six
                reportable segments as set out in Note 26 to reflect the change.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (f)   Foreign currency translation
           The functional currency of the Company is US$. The Company’s subsidiaries with operations in
           Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC (“Hong Kong” or “Hong
           Kong S.A.R.”), the United States and other jurisdictions generally use their respective local currencies
           as their functional currencies. When the Company determines that a subsidiary is operating in
           a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of this subsidiary shall be remeasured
           prospectively as if the functional currency were the functional currency of its immediate parent
           company. The reporting currency of the Company is RMB as the major operations of the Company are
           within the PRC. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than the subsidiaries
           with the functional currency of RMB, are translated into RMB using the exchange rate as of the
           balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and the average daily exchange rate for each month for
           income and expense items. Translation gains and losses, including those arising from intra-entity
           foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term-investment nature, are recorded in accumulated
           other comprehensive income or loss as a component of shareholders’ equity.

           In the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than the
           functional currency are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate
           in effect at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
           are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
           currency using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising from foreign
           currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated income statements during the year in which
           they occur.

     (g) Revenue recognition
           Revenue is principally generated from customer management services, membership fees and
           value-added services, logistics services, cloud services, sales of goods and other revenue. Revenue
           represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of promised
           goods or services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities and is recorded net of value-
           added tax (“VAT”). Consistent with the criteria of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”,
           the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control
           of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point
           in time, the Company also considers the following indicators to assess whether control of a promised
           good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to payment, (ii) legal title, (iii) physical
           possession, (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership and (v) acceptance of the good or service.
           For performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue over time by
           measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.

           For revenue arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, each distinct performance
           obligation is separately accounted for and the total consideration is allocated to each performance
           obligation based on the relative standalone selling price at contract inception.

           The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction to determine whether revenue
           should be recorded on a gross or net basis. The Company is acting as the principal if it obtains control
           over the goods and services before they are transferred to customers. Generally, when the Company
           is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices,
           or has several but not all of these indicators, the Company acts as the principal and revenue is
           recorded on a gross basis. Generally, when the Company is not primarily obligated in a transaction,
           does not bear the inventory risk and does not have the ability to establish the price, the Company acts
           as the agent and revenue is recorded on a net basis.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                The Company may from time to time provide incentives in various forms to attract or retain
                consumers. Under the circumstances where consumers are not considered as customers under ASC
                606, the Company evaluates the features of different incentives provided to consumers to determine
                whether they represent implicit or explicit obligations to consumers on behalf of merchants, which
                are considered as payments to customers and are recorded as reduction of revenues. Incentives that
                are not considered as payments to customers are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.

                When services are exchanged or swapped for other services, revenue is recognized based on the
                estimated standalone selling price of services promised to customer if the fair value of the services
                received cannot be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized for barter transactions
                was not material for each of the periods presented.

                Practical expedients and exemptions
                The Company applies the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
                obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts for
                which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services
                performed.

                The Company applies the practical expedient to not adjust any of the transaction price for the time
                value of money for contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services
                to the customer and payment by the customer is within one year.

                Revenue recognition policies by type are as follows:

                (i)   Customer management services
                      The Company generates customer management revenue from merchants by offering an
                      integrated package and a comprehensive solution comprised of a diverse array of services to
                      enable them to attract, engage and retain consumers, complete transactions, improve their
                      branding and enhance operating efficiency. The customer management revenue are charged
                      primarily on cost-per-click basis, cost-per-thousand impressions basis, time basis and cost-
                      per-sale basis (e.g., fees charged based on the value of merchandise transacted, including
                      commission on transactions).

                      Cost-per-click ("CPC") marketing services
                      CPC marketing services allow merchants to bid for keywords or bid to market to groups of
                      consumers with similar profiles that match product or service listings appearing in search
                      results or browser results on the Company’s marketplaces. In general, merchants prepay for
                      CPC marketing services and the related revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product
                      or service listings as this is the point of time when the merchants benefit from the marketing
                      services rendered.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         (i)    Customer management services (Continued)
                Cost-per-thousand impressions ("CPM") and time-based marketing services
                CPM and time-based marketing services allow merchants to place marketing content on the
                Company’s marketplaces, at fixed prices or prices established by a market-based bidding
                system and in particular formats. In general, merchants need to prepay for CPM and time-based
                marketing services which are accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized
                either ratably over the period in which the marketing content is displayed as the merchants
                simultaneously consume the benefits as the marketing content is displayed or when an
                marketing content is viewed by users, depending on the type of marketing services selected by
                the merchants.

                Cost-per-sale ("CPS") marketing services
                The Company charges fees from merchants for transactions completed on Taobao, Tmall and
                certain other major marketplaces of the Company. The fees are generally determined as a
                percentage based on the value of merchandise sold by the merchants. Merchant deposits that
                are expected to be non-refundable is accounted for as variable consideration (Note 2(ac)),
                which is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period
                if additional information becomes available. Revenue related to CPS marketing services is
                recognized in the consolidated income statements based on the expected value when the
                performance obligation is satisfied. Adjustments to the estimated variable consideration related
                to prior reporting periods were not material for each of the periods presented.

                The Company also places marketing content through the third-party marketing affiliate
                program. Revenue generated on the Company’s marketplaces or through the third-party
                marketing affiliate program are recorded on a gross basis when the Company is the principal to
                the merchants in the arrangements. For third-party marketing affiliates with whom the Company
                has an arrangement to share the revenue, traffic acquisition cost is also recognized at the
                same time if the marketing content on the landing page clicked by the users is from merchants
                participating in the third-party marketing affiliate program.

         (ii)   Membership fees and value-added services
                The Company earns membership fees revenue from wholesale sellers in respect of the sale of
                membership packages and subscriptions that allow them to host premium storefronts on the
                Company’s wholesale marketplaces, as well as the provision of other value-added services,
                and from customers in respect of the sale of membership packages which allow them to access
                premium content on Youku’s paid content platforms. These service fees are paid in advance
                for a specific contracted service period. All these fees are initially deferred as deferred revenue
                and customer advances when received and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
                respective service contracts as the services are provided.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report    283

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                (iii) Logistics services
                      The Company earns logistics services revenue from express delivery and supply chain services
                      provided by Cainiao, on-demand delivery services provided by Ele.me and logistics services
                      provided by Lazada. Revenue is recognized over time when the logistics services are provided.

                (iv) Cloud services
                      The Company earns cloud services revenue from the provision of public cloud services and non-
                      public cloud services to domestic and international enterprise customers:

                      •    Public cloud services, where the company generates revenue from a wide range of cloud
                           services, including, among others, elastic computing, storage, network, database, big data
                           and AI computing, security and proprietary servers. Enterprise customers can pay for these
                           services on a consumption or subscription basis, such as on-demand delivery of computing
                           services and storage capacities. Certain cloud services allow customers to use hosted
                           software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. Revenue
                           related to cloud services charged on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the
                           contract period. Revenue related to cloud services charged on a consumption basis, such
                           as the quantity of storage or elastic computing services used in a period, is recognized
                           based on the customer utilization of the resources.

                      •    Non-public cloud services, where the company generates revenue through packaged cloud
                           services, including hardware, software license, software installation service, application
                           development and maintenance service. Each distinct performance obligation identified
                           is separately accounted for and the total consideration is allocated to each performance
                           obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices at contract inception. Revenue
                           for each performance obligation is recognized when the control of the promised goods or
                           services is transferred to the customer.

                (v)   Sales of goods
                      Revenue from the sales of goods is mainly generated from Sun Art, Tmall Supermarket,
                      Freshippo and Alibaba Health’s direct sales businesses. Revenue from the sales of goods is
                      recognized when the control over the promised goods is transferred to customers. Receipts
                      of fees in respect of all other incidental goods or services provided by the Company that are
                      distinct performance obligations are recognized when the control of the underlying goods or
                      services is transferred to the customers. The amounts relating to these incidental services are not
                      material to the Company’s total revenue for each of the periods presented.

           (h) Cost of revenue
                Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of inventories, logistics costs, expenses associated with the
                operation of the Company’s mobile platforms and websites (such as depreciation and maintenance
                expenses for servers and computers, call centers and other equipment, and bandwidth and co-
                location fees), staff costs and share-based compensation expense, traffic acquisition costs, content
                costs, payment processing fees and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to
                the Company’s principal operations.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (i)   Product development expenses
           Product development expenses consist primarily of staff costs and share-based compensation
           expense for research and development personnel and other expenses that are directly attributable to
           the development of new technologies and products for the businesses of the Company, such as the
           development of the Internet infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and
           networks.

           The Company expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and
           implementation phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance
           of the existing websites or the development of software and website content. Costs incurred in the
           development phase are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life. However, as
           the amount of costs qualified for capitalization has been insignificant, all website and software
           development costs have been expensed as incurred.

     (j)   Sales and marketing expenses
           Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising expenses, promotion
           expenses, staff costs and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions and other related
           incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers and merchants.

           The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and
           expenses the costs of delivering advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or
           airtime is used. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled RMB91,103 million, RMB76,818 million
           and RMB88,217 million during the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

     (k) Share-based compensation
           Share-based awards granted are measured at fair value on grant date and the value is recognized
           as share-based compensation expense (i) immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions
           are required, or (ii) using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
           requisite service period. The fair values of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares are
           determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying shares and the fair value of share
           options is generally determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Share-based compensation
           expense, when recognized, is charged to the consolidated income statements with the corresponding
           entry to additional paid-in capital, liability or noncontrolling interests as disclosed in Note 2(d).

           On each measurement date, the Company reviews internal and external sources of information to
           assist in the estimation of various attributes to determine the fair value of the share-based awards,
           including the fair value of the underlying shares, expected life and expected volatility. The Company
           recognizes the impact of any revisions to the original forfeiture rate assumptions in the consolidated
           income statements, with a corresponding adjustment to equity or liability.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report   285

           (l)   Other employee benefits
                 The Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer
                 defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits
                 are provided to employees. The relevant labor regulations require the Company’s subsidiaries in
                 the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions based on the
                 applicable benchmarks and rates stipulated by the local government. The relevant local labor and
                 social welfare authorities are responsible for meeting all retirement benefits obligations and the
                 Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC have no further commitments beyond their monthly contributions.
                 The contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred. The Company also makes payments to other
                 defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for the benefit of employees employed by
                 subsidiaries outside of the PRC.

                 During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, contributions to the plans amounting to
                 RMB13,086 million, RMB13,953 million and RMB14,190 million, respectively, were charged to the
                 consolidated income statements. Amounts contributed to defined benefit plans during the years
                 ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were insignificant.

           (m) Income taxes
                 The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income tax
                 is recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
                 carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
                 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
                 in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
                 tax of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
                 enactment date. Valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more
                 likely than not that the asset will not be realizable in the foreseeable future.

                 Deferred tax is recognized on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, which are presumed to
                 be distributed to parent companies, unless there is sufficient evidence that the subsidiaries have
                 invested or will invest the undistributed earnings permanently in the domestic jurisdictions or the
                 earnings will not be subject to tax upon the subsidiaries’ liquidation. Deferred tax is recognized for
                 temporary differences in relation to certain investments in equity method investees, equity securities
                 and other investments.

                 The Company adopts ASC 740 “Income Taxes” which prescribes a more likely than not threshold
                 for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
                 taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
                 classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and
                 penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income
                 tax disclosures. The Company did not have significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any
                 unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of and for
                 the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (n) Government grants
        Government grants, which mainly represent amounts received from central and local governments in
        connection with the Company’s investments in local business districts and contributions to technology
        development, are recognized as income in other income, net or as a reduction of specific costs
        and expenses for which the grants are intended to compensate. Such amounts are recognized in
        the consolidated income statements upon receipt and when all conditions attached to the grants
        are fulfilled. For the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, government grants recorded as
        a reduction of specific costs and expenses were RMB6,028 million, RMB5,889 million and RMB5,705
        million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, government grants
        recorded as other income, net were RMB1,661 million, RMB1,857 million and RMB1,329 million,
        respectively. As of March 31, 2023 and 2024, government grants recorded as other liabilities were
        RMB1,687 million and RMB1,540 million, respectively.

        Government grants related to assets are recognized as a reduction of the carrying amount of the
        related asset when all conditions attached to the grants are fulfilled and are recognized in the
        consolidated income statements as a reduction of related depreciation or amortization expense over
        the estimated useful live of the related asset on a straight-line method.

        In April 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures
        by Business Entities about Government Assistance”, which provides guidance on the disclosure of
        transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting
        model by analogy. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial
        position, results of operations and cash flows.

     (o) Leases
        The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases that transfer substantially
        all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases
        as if there was an acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the
        lease. All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. The Company has no significant finance
        leases.

        The Company recognizes lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance
        sheet for leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in non-current prepayments,
        receivables and other assets (Note 13), and operating lease liabilities are included in current accrued
        expenses, accounts payable and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities (Note 19) on the
        consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are
        initially recognized based on the present value of future lease payments at lease commencement.
        The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease
        commencement and the initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and is recorded net of any lease
        incentives received. As the interest rates implicit in most of the leases are not readily determinable,
        the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at lease
        commencement to determine the present value of the future lease payments. Operating lease
        expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

        The Company elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for leases of certain asset
        classes such as shops and malls and equipment leases. Lease and non-lease components for leases
        of other asset classes are accounted for separately. The Company also elected not to recognize short-
        term leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less.

           (p) Cash and cash equivalents
                The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
                months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily
                represent bank deposits and fixed deposits with original maturities of less than three months.

           (q) Short-term investments
                Short-term investments consist primarily of investments in fixed deposits with original maturities
                between three months and one year and certain investments in wealth management products,
                certificates of deposits, marketable debt securities and other investments that the Company has the
                intention to redeem within one year.

           (r) Accounts receivable
                Accounts receivable represent the amounts that the Company has an unconditional right to
                consideration. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
                uncollectible receivable amounts which is estimated using the approach based on expected losses.
                The allowance for doubtful accounts were RMB6,174 million and RMB8,042 million as of March
                31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The Company’s estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts
                considers factors such as historical credit loss experience, age of receivable balances, current market
                conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as an
                assessment of receivables due from specific identifiable counterparties to determine whether these
                receivables are considered at risk or uncollectible. The Company assesses collectibility by pooling
                receivables that have similar risk characteristics and evaluates receivables individually when specific
                receivables no longer share those risk characteristics. For receivables evaluated individually, when
                it is determined that foreclosure is probable or when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty at
                the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or
                sale of collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting
                date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.

           (s) Inventories
                Inventories mainly consist of merchandise available for sale. They are accounted for using the
                weighted average cost method and stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
                value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
                completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

     (t)   Equity securities and other investments
           Equity securities and other investments represent the Company’s investments in equity securities that
           are not accounted for under the equity method, as well as other investments which primarily consist
           of debt investments.

           (i)    Equity securities
                  Equity securities not accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with
                  unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements, according to ASC
                  321 “Investments — Equity Securities”.

                  The Company elected to record a majority of equity investments in privately held companies
                  using the measurement alternative at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for
                  observable price changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments
                  of the same issuer.

                  Equity investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement
                  alternative are subject to periodic impairment reviews. The Company’s impairment analysis
                  considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the fair
                  value of these equity securities.

                  In computing realized gains and losses on equity securities, the Company determines cost based
                  on amounts paid using the average cost method. Dividend income is recognized when the right
                  to receive the payment is established.

           (ii)   Debt investments
                  Debt investments consist of investments in debt securities and loan investments which are
                  accounted for at amortized cost or under the fair value option, which the Company has elected
                  for certain investments including convertible and exchangeable bonds subscribed. The fair
                  value option permits the irrevocable election on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial
                  recognition or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.
                  The investments accounted for under the fair value option are carried at fair value with
                  unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements. Interest income
                  from debt investments is recognized using the effective interest method which is reviewed and
                  adjusted periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows. Debt investments also include
                  other treasury investments which mainly consist of investments in fixed deposits, certificates
                  of deposits and marketable debt securities with original maturities over one year for treasury
                  purposes. The remaining maturities of these treasury investments held by the Company
                  generally range from one to three years.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (u) Investments in equity method investees
                The Company applies the equity method to account for equity investments in common stock or in-
                substance common stock, according to ASC 323 “Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures”,
                over which it has significant influence but does not own a controlling financial interest, unless the fair
                value option is elected for an investment.

                An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward
                characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity’s common stock. The Company considers
                subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining
                whether an investment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity’s common
                stock.

                Under the equity method, the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the
                equity method investee is recognized in the consolidated income statements and its share of
                post-acquisition movements in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in other
                comprehensive income. The Company records its share of the results of the equity method investees
                on a one quarter in arrears basis. The excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the
                underlying equity in net assets of the equity method investee generally represents goodwill and
                intangible assets acquired. When the Company’s share of losses of the equity method investee equals
                or exceeds its interest in the equity method investee, the Company does not recognize further losses,
                unless the Company has incurred obligations or made payments or guarantees on behalf of the
                equity method investee.

                The Company continually reviews its investments in equity method investees to determine whether
                a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The primary factors the
                Company considers in its determination include the severity and the length of time that the fair value
                of the investment is below its carrying value; the financial condition, the operating performance and
                the prospects of the equity method investee; the geographic region, market and industry in which the
                equity method investee operates; and other company specific information such as recent financing
                rounds completed by the equity method investee. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-
                than-temporary, the carrying value of the investment in the equity method investee is written down to
                its fair value.

           (v) Property and equipment, net
                Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
                loss. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with no residual value based on the
                estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range as follows:

                Computer equipment and software             3–5 years

                Furniture, office and transportation
                  equipment and others                      3–10 years

                Buildings and other property                10–50 years

                Property improvements                       shorter of remaining lease period or estimated useful life

     (v) Property and equipment, net (Continued)
         Construction in progress represents buildings and related premises under construction, which is
         stated at actual construction cost less any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to
         the respective category of property and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use.

         Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and asset improvements are capitalized.
         The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of or retired are removed from the
         accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated income statements.

     (w) Intangible assets other than licensed copyrights
         Intangible assets mainly include those acquired through business combinations and purchased
         intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recognized as
         assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion.
         Intangible assets arising from business combinations are measured at fair value upon acquisition
         using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and ratio analysis with reference to
         comparable companies in similar industries under the income approach, market approach and cost
         approach. Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangible assets include
         future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Purchased intangible assets are initially
         recognized and measured at cost upon acquisition. Separately identifiable intangible assets that
         have determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-
         line method as follows:

         User base and customer relationships              3–16 years

         Trade names, trademarks and domain names          5–20 years

         Developed technology and patents                  2–10 years

         Non-compete agreements                            over the contracted term of up to 10 years

     (x) Licensed copyrights
         Licensed copyrights related to titles to movies, television series, variety shows, animations and other
         video content acquired from external parties are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or fair
         value. The amortization period for the licensed content vary depending on the type of content, which
         typically ranges from six months to ten years. Licensed copyrights are presented on the consolidated
         balance sheets as current assets under prepayments, receivables and other assets, or non-current
         assets under intangible assets, net, based on estimated time of usage. Licensed copyrights are
         generally amortized using an accelerated method based on historical viewership consumption
         patterns. Estimates of the consumption patterns for licensed copyrights are reviewed periodically and
         revised if necessary. For the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, amortization expenses in
         connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB8,610 million, RMB8,446 million and RMB8,361 million
         were recorded in cost of revenue within Digital Media and Entertainment Group.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (x) Licensed copyrights (Continued)
                On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates the program usefulness of licensed copyrights pursuant
                to the guidance in ASC 920 “Entertainment — Broadcasters”, which provides that the rights be
                reported at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. When there is a change in the expected usage
                of licensed copyrights, the Company estimates the fair value of licensed copyrights to determine if
                any impairment exists. The fair value of licensed copyrights is determined by estimating the expected
                cash flows from advertising and membership fees, less any costs and expenses, over the remaining
                useful lives of the licensed copyrights at the film-group level. Estimates that impact these cash flows
                include anticipated levels of demand for the Company’s advertising services and the expected selling
                prices of advertisements. For the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, impairment charges in
                connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB745 million, RMB1,133 million and nil were recorded in
                cost of revenue within Digital Media and Entertainment Group.

           (y) Goodwill
                Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition date amounts of
                the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired
                entity as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries. Goodwill is not
                amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
                in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company
                may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative
                goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers factors such as
                macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of
                the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations, business plans and
                strategies of the reporting unit. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that
                the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test
                is performed. The Company may also bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to
                perform the quantitative impairment test.

                The Company performs the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of each
                reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds
                its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting
                unit exceeds its fair value, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair
                value is recognized as impairment. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant
                management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, allocation of assets, liabilities
                and goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.

           (z) Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and licensed copyrights
                The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
                indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
                held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the
                future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the assets
                are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the
                carrying amount of the assets or asset groups exceeds the fair value of the assets or asset groups.
                Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and licensed copyrights recognized for the years
                ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 was RMB973 million, RMB1,922 million and RMB14,847 million,
                respectively.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (aa) Derivatives and hedging
         All contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are recognized on the consolidated balance
         sheets as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
         are either recognized periodically in the consolidated income statements or in other comprehensive
         income depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting and
         are so designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.

         To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented
         at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which
         includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge
         effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be effective in accomplishing the objective of
         offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of
         the hedging relationship is evaluated on a prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and
         quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms
         of the derivative to those of the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the
         changes in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to that of the hedged
         item. A hedging relationship is considered initially effective if the results of the hedging instrument
         are within a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.

         Interest rate swaps
         Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the cash flows attributable
         to recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted payments may qualify as cash flow hedges. The
         Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap floating interest payments related to
         certain borrowings for fixed interest payments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain
         forecasted payments and obligations. All changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are
         designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
         income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the
         same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

         The Company has elected the optional expedients under ASC 848 “Reference Rate Reform” for certain
         existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges in the hedging relationship
         designation and the assessment of probability of forecasted transaction and hedge effectiveness.

     (ab) Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes
         Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes are recognized initially at fair value, net of upfront
         fees, debt discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees. Upfront fees, debt
         discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees are recorded as a reduction of
         the proceeds received and the related accretion is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated
         income statements over the estimated term of the facilities using the effective interest method.




                                                                                    Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report     293

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (ac) Merchant deposits
                The Company collects deposits representing an annual upfront service fee from merchants on Tmall
                before the beginning of each calendar year. These deposits are initially recorded as a liability by the
                Company. The deposits are refundable to a merchant if the level of sales volume that is generated by
                that merchant on Tmall meets the target during the period. If the transaction volume target is not met
                at the end of each calendar year, the relevant deposits will become non-refundable. These merchant
                deposits are accounted for as variable consideration at an amount that is estimated at contract
                inception. The estimate is updated at the end of each reporting period and when there are changes
                in circumstances during the reporting period. Merchant deposits are recognized as revenue in the
                consolidated income statements when the likelihood of refund to the merchant is considered remote
                based on the patterns of sales volume generated by the merchant during the reporting period.

           (ad) Deferred revenue and customer advances
                Deferred revenue and customer advances generally represent cash received from customers
                that relate to goods or services to be provided in the future. Deferred revenue, mainly relating to
                membership fees and cloud services revenue, is stated at the amount of service fees received less the
                amount previously recognized as revenue upon the provision of the respective services to customers.

           (ae) Commitments and contingencies
                In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings
                and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for the
                contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
                the liability can be reasonably estimated.

                Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which
                may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events
                occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses these contingent liabilities, which inherently involves
                judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the
                Company or unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, the Company, in consultation
                with its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims
                as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If
                the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred
                and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the
                consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
                contingency is not probable, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent
                liability, together with an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible loss, if determinable and
                material, would be disclosed.

                Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in
                which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

           (af) Treasury shares
                The Company accounts for treasury shares using the cost method. Under this method, the cost
                incurred to purchase the shares is recorded in the treasury shares account on the consolidated
                balance sheets. At retirement of the treasury shares, the ordinary shares account is charged only for
                the aggregate par value of the shares. The excess of the acquisition cost of treasury shares over the
                aggregate par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (ag) Statutory reserves
         In accordance with the relevant regulations and their articles of association, subsidiaries of the
         Company incorporated in the PRC are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profit
         determined based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations to the general reserve until
         the reserve has reached 50% of the relevant subsidiary’s registered capital. Appropriations to the
         enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the respective
         board of directors of the subsidiaries. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are
         not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. During the years
         ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, appropriations to the general reserve amounted to RMB2,492
         million, RMB3,138 million and RMB1,756 million, respectively. No appropriations to the enterprise
         expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund have been made by the Company.

     (ah) Interest income
         Interest income is recorded in the consolidated income statements as it accrues for the interest-
         earning assets using the effective interest method. During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and
         2024, interest income of RMB13,602 million, RMB16,339 million and RMB24,868 million, respectively,
         were recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statements.

     (ai) Newly adopted accounting standard updates
         In April 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, “Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options
         (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):
         Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies
         an issuer’s accounting for certain convertible instruments and the application of derivatives scope
         exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. This guidance also addresses how convertible
         instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and required enhanced
         disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity.
         The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of
         operations and cash flows.

         In April 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting
         for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”, which provides
         guidance on the acquirer’s accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business
         combination. The amendments require an acquirer recognizes and measures contract assets and
         contract liabilities acquired in a business combination at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC
         606 as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance also provides certain practical expedients for
         acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from
         revenue contracts in a business combination. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively
         and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of
         operations and cash flows.

         In April 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic
         405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations”, which require a buyer in a supplier
         finance program disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the supplier finance
         program. Rollforward information is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2025.
         Details of the key terms of the program and the outstanding obligations confirmed as valid are set out
         in Note 19.

      3.   Recent accounting pronouncements
           In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects
           of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and issued subsequent amendments within ASU 2021-01
           and ASU 2022-06 (collectively, including ASU 2020-04, “ASC 848”) in January 2021 and December 2022
           respectively. ASC 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP on contract
           modifications and hedge accounting to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that
           reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform,
           if certain criteria are met. These optional expedients and exceptions provided in ASC 848 are effective for
           the Company from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company has elected the optional
           expedients for certain existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, which did
           not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company
           is evaluating the effects, if any, of the potential election of the other optional expedients and exceptions
           provided in this guidance on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

           In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement
           of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”, which clarifies that a contractual restriction
           on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and,
           therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot,
           as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also
           requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance
           is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments
           recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company
           for the year ending March 31, 2025 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2025.
           Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a
           material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

           In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
           Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements. The
           amendments require the disclosure of (1) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to
           the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (2) an amount for other
           segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition; and (3) the title and position
           of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s). The amendments also
           provide disclosure requirements for interim periods and entities that have a single reportable segment.
           The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial
           statements. This guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2025 and interim
           reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
           evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance.

           In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income
           Tax Disclosures”, which improves income tax disclosures. The amendments require the disclosure of
           specific categories in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet
           a quantitative threshold. The amendments also require disaggregated information about the amount of
           income taxes paid (net of refunds received), Income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax
           expense (or benefit) and Income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations. The new guidance
           is required to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. This guidance is effective for the Company
           for the year ending March 31, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of
           the adoption of this guidance.

      4.   Significant mergers and acquisitions and investments (Continued)

           Equity investments and others (Continued)
           (c)   Investment in Ant Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”)
                 Ant Group provides comprehensive digital payment services and facilitates digital financial and
                 value-added services for consumers and merchants, in China and across the world. In September
                 2019, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions, the Company received the 33% equity
                 interest in Ant Group pursuant to the share and asset purchase agreement as amended from time to
                 time (the “SAPA”).

                 The Company accounts for its equity interest in Ant Group under the equity method. Upon the
                 completion, the Company recorded the 33% equity interest in Ant Group with a carrying value
                 amounting to RMB90.7 billion in investments in equity method investees. The difference between
                 the carrying value of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the Company’s share of the carrying
                 value of Ant Group’s net assets upon completion is a basis difference, which mainly represents the
                 fair value adjustments of amortizable intangible assets and equity investments. These adjustments
                 amounted to RMB24.5 billion and RMB5.3 billion, respectively, both of which were net of their
                 corresponding tax effects.

                 Subsequent to the receipt of the equity interest in Ant Group, the proportionate share of results of
                 Ant Group, adjusted for the effects of the basis difference as described above, is recorded in share
                 of results of equity method investees in the consolidated income statements on a one quarter in
                 arrears basis. Following the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group, the Company has pre-emptive
                 rights to participate in other issuances of equity securities by Ant Group and certain of its affiliates
                 prior to the time of Ant Group meeting certain minimum criteria for a qualified IPO set forth in the
                 SAPA. These pre-emptive rights entitle the Company to maintain the equity ownership percentage the
                 Company holds in Ant Group immediately prior to any such issuances. In connection with the exercise
                 of the pre-emptive rights, the Company is also entitled to receive certain payments from Ant Group,
                 effectively funding the subscription for these additional equity interest, up to a value of US$1.5 billion,
                 subject to certain adjustments. In addition, under the SAPA, in certain circumstances the Company
                 is permitted to exercise pre-emptive rights through an alternative arrangement which will further
                 protect the Company from dilution.

                 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Ant Group repurchased approximately 7% equity
                 interest from its existing shareholders and the shares repurchased were allocated to the employee
                 incentive plans of Ant Group. The number of shares held by the Company in Ant Group remains
                 unchanged from legal perspective, the Company’s equity interest in Ant Group on a fully diluted basis
                 remains unchanged at 33%.

                 For accounting purposes, the Company will take into consideration a proportionate share of equity
                 interest held by the employee incentive plans of Ant Group to account for its share of results from
                 its investment in Ant Group, subject to dilution as the equity interest under the employee incentive
                 plans of Ant Group is transferred out. During the year ended March 31, 2024, there was no material
                 change in the equity interest held by the employee incentive plans of Ant Group. While the Company’s
                 carrying value of the investment in Ant Group remain unchanged upon completion, the transactions
                 result in additional basis difference of RMB5.6 billion upon completion, which was mainly allocated
                 to amortizable intangible assets of RMB1.7 billion with a weighted average amortization period of 7
                 years, goodwill of RMB3.9 billion, equity investments of RMB0.5 billion and deferred tax liabilities of
                 RMB0.5 billion.

           statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and regulations in the PRC.

           Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for
           domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for,
           among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology
           Enterprises. Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as Software Enterprises and thereby entitled
           to full exemption from EIT for two years beginning from their first profitable calendar year and a 50%
           reduction for the subsequent three calendar years. In addition, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise
           (“KSE”) within China’s national plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The KSE status is subject to
           review by the relevant authorities every year and the timing of the annual review and notification by the
           relevant authorities may vary from year to year. The related reduction in tax expense as a result of official
           notification confirming the KSE status is accounted for upon the receipt of such notification.

     Composition of income tax expenses (Continued)
     The tax status of the subsidiaries of the Company with major taxable profits is described below:

     •    Alibaba (China) Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alibaba China”), Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd. (“Taobao
          China”), Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tmall China”) and Alibaba (China) Co., Ltd (“China
          Co.”), entities primarily engaged in the operations of the Company’s wholesale marketplaces,
          Taobao, Tmall, and technology, software research and development and relevant services,
          respectively, were qualified as High and New Technology Enterprises. For the taxation years of 2021,
          2022 and 2023, Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China, and China Co. applied an EIT rate of 15%
          as High and New Technology Enterprises.

     •    Alibaba (Beijing) Software Services Co., Ltd (“Alibaba Beijing”), an entity primarily engaged in the
          operations of technology, software research and development and relevant services, was recognized
          as a High and New Technology Enterprise. Alibaba Beijing was also granted the Software Enterprise
          status and was thereby entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning from its first
          profitable taxation year of 2017, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three consecutive years
          starting from the taxation year of 2019. Accordingly, Alibaba Beijing was entitled to an EIT rate of
          12.5% (50% reduction in the standard statutory rate) during the taxation years of 2019, 2020 and
          2021. For the taxation years of 2022 and 2023, Alibaba Beijing applied an EIT rate of 15% as High and
          New Technology Enterprise.

     Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31,
     2022, 2023 and 2024.

     Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to
     their foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with
     at least 25% equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the relevant
     requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between Chinese mainland and Hong Kong S.A.R. Since
     the equity holders of the major PRC subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies
     and meet the relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between Chinese mainland and
     Hong Kong S.A.R., the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings
     which are anticipated to be distributed. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has accrued the withholding
     tax on substantially all of the distributable earnings of the PRC subsidiaries, except for those undistributed
     earnings that the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB304.7 billion.

               securities and other investments, as well as accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under PRC tax laws.
           (ii) Change in valuation allowances is mainly from the valuation allowances provided on the deferred tax assets related to the
                tax losses carried forward due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization. Valuation allowances are also provided on
                the deferred tax assets related to the investment in certain equity securities and other investments. If events occur in the
                future that improve the certainty of realization, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will be made and consequently
                income tax expenses will be reduced.
           (iii) The related deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were provided on the assumption that substantially all

                 that the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB233.6 billion and RMB304.7 billion,
                 respectively.
           (iv) Deferred tax liabilities for investments in equity method investees mainly includes the deferred tax effect on the gain in
                relation to the receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group of RMB19.7 billion. Others primarily represents deferred tax
                liabilities for investments in equity securities and other investments.

           As of March 31, 2024, the accumulated tax losses of subsidiaries incorporated in Singapore, Hong Kong
           S.A.R. and Malaysia, subject to the agreement of the relevant tax authorities, of RMB36,711 million,
           RMB9,787 million and RMB2,122 million, respectively, are allowed to be carried forward to offset against
           future taxable profits. The carry forward of tax losses in Singapore and Hong Kong S.A.R. generally
           has no time limit, while the tax losses in Malaysia will expire, if unused, in the years ending March 31,
           2025 through 2034. The accumulated tax losses of subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC, subject to the
           agreement of the PRC tax authorities, of RMB149,388 million as of March 31, 2024 will expire, if unused, in

                employees and consultants of the Company or affiliated companies under equity incentive plans

                “2014 Plan”), which was adopted in September 2014 and has a ten-year term, is in effect and governs
                the terms of the awards. If an award terminates, expires or lapses, or is canceled for any reason,
                ordinary shares subject to the award become available for the grant of a new award under the
                2014 Plan. Starting from April 1, 2015 and on each anniversary thereof, an additional amount equal
                to the lesser of (A) 200,000,000 ordinary shares, and (B) such lesser number of ordinary shares as
                determined by the board of directors becomes available for the grant of a new award under the 2014

                shares. Eight ordinary shares are issuable upon the vesting or the exercise of one share-based award.

          Vested and expected to vest as of
            March 31, 2024 (ii)                                                 6,777,267                 86.28                 5.5

         (i) No outstanding share options will be vested or exercisable after the expiry of a period of up to twelve years from the
             date of grant.
         (ii) Share options expected to vest are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total
              outstanding share options.

         As of March 31, 2024, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options was RMB401 million.

      8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

           (a) Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
                Share options (Continued)
                No share options were granted during the year ended March 31, 2023. The fair value of each option
                granted during the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2024 is estimated on the measurement date
                using the Black-Scholes model by applying the assumptions below:

                                                                                                             Year ended March 31,
                                                                                                                   2022                2024
                 Risk-free interest rate (i)                                                            1.93%–2.00%                   4.50%
                 Expected dividend yield (ii)                                                                        0%                   0%
                 Expected life (years) (iii)                                                                 3.71–7.14                  6.50
                 Expected volatility (iv)                                                                        35.7%                44.8%

                (i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
                    life of the share options in effect on the measurement date.
                (ii) For the share options granted during the year ended March 31, 2022, expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as
                     the Company had no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its ordinary shares. For the share options granted
                     during the year ended March 31, 2024, expected dividend yield is nil as the Company decided to pay upon the exercise
                     of such share options in an amount equivalent to the dividends as detailed in Note 28 to the participants.
                (iii) Expected life of share options is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise of share options.
                (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company in the period equal to the expected life
                     of each grant.

                As of March 31, 2024, there were RMB624 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
                outstanding share options, net of expected forfeitures. These amounts are expected to be recognized
                over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

                During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company recognized share-based
                compensation expense of RMB86 million, RMB490 million and RMB240 million, respectively, in
                connection with the above share options.

                Following the dividends as detailed in Note 28, the Company decided to pay upon vesting of certain
                RSUs or exercise of certain share options in an amount equivalent to the dividends to the participants.
                This arrangement has no impact to the classification and vesting condition of the awards.

           (b) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group
                Prior to 2023, certain employees of the Company were granted share-based awards by Ant Group
                and Hangzhou Junhan Equity Investment Partnership (“Junhan”), a major equity holder of Ant Group.
                These awards tied to the valuation of Ant Group and are settled by respective grantors upon disposal
                of these awards by the holders, vesting or exercise of these awards, depending on the forms of these
                awards. In addition, Junhan and Ant Group have the right to repurchase the vested awards (or any
                underlying equity for the settlement of the vested awards) granted by them, as applicable, from the
                holders upon an initial public offering of Ant Group or the termination of the holders’ employment
                with the Company at a price to be determined based on the then fair market value of Ant Group.

8.   Share-based awards (Continued)

     (b) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group (Continued)
         For accounting purposes, these awards meet the definition of a financial derivative. The cost
         relating to these awards is recognized by the Company and the related expense is recognized over
         the requisite service period in the consolidated income statements with a corresponding credit to
         additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these awards are recorded in the
         consolidated income statements. The expenses relating to these awards are remeasured at the fair
         value on each reporting date until their settlement dates. The fair value of the underlying equity is
         primarily determined based on the contemporaneous valuation report, external information and
         information obtained from Ant Group.

         During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company recognized a net reversal of
         RMB11,585 million, expenses of RMB668 million and a net reversal of RMB6,691 million, respectively,
         in respect of the share-based awards relating to Ant Group.

         Starting from April 2020, the parties agreed to settle with each other the cost associated with certain
         share-based awards granted to each other’s employees upon vesting. The settlement amounts under
         this arrangement depend on the values of Ant Group share-based awards granted to the Company’s
         employees and the Company’s share-based awards granted to employees of Ant Group, in which the
         net settlement amount is insignificant to the Company.

         Share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of the Company and Ant Group are generally subject
         to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the plans, or a vesting period of
         up to ten years for certain management members of the Company.

      9.   Earnings per share/ADS
           Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

           Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
           weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, adjusted for treasury shares. Basic earnings per
           ADS is derived from the basic earnings per share.

           For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic
           earnings per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including share-based awards, under the
           treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities, of which the amounts are insignificant, have been
           excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted
           earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per share.

           The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share/ADS for the
           following periods:

           For equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative as of March 31, 2024, the
           Company recorded cumulative upward adjustments of RMB20,965 million and cumulative impairments

           Debt investments
           Debt investments include convertible and exchangeable bonds accounted for under the fair value option,
           for which the fair value as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were RMB7,167 million and RMB3,344 million,
           respectively. The aggregate fair value of these convertible and exchangeable bonds was lower than their
           aggregate unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 by RMB2,993 million and RMB4,607
           million, respectively. Unrealized losses recorded on these convertible and exchangeable bonds in the
           consolidated income statements were RMB3,112 million, RMB262 million and RMB1,225 million during the
           years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

           Debt investments also include debt investments accounted for at amortized cost, for which the allowance
           for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were RMB4,085 million and RMB5,034 million, respectively.

           During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, impairment losses (reversal of impairment losses)
           on these debt investments of RMB3,225 million, RMB(356) million and RMB872 million, respectively, were
           recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statements.

           During the year ended March 31, 2023, there were modifications, including alignment of the maturity date
           and adjustments of numbers of collateral, to loans provided to a shareholder of an equity method investee
           with principal amount of RMB4,931 million. As of March 31, 2023, repayment of the modified loan is
           expected to be provided substantially through the sale of collateral, while as of March 31, 2024, repayment
           of another loan with principal amount of RMB596 million and the modified loan are expected to be
           provided substantially through the sale of collateral. Expected credit losses for these loans were assessed
           on an individual basis, based on the fair value of the corresponding shares pledged as collateral as of the
           reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. The fair value of the collateral as of March 31,
           2023 and 2024 were RMB3,574 million and RMB3,304 million, respectively. There is no commitment to lend
           additional funds.

           The carrying amount of debt investments accounted for at amortized cost approximates their fair value
           due to the fact that the related effective interest rates approximate rates currently offered by financial
           institutions for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

           Other treasury investments mainly comprise of investments in fixed deposits, certificates of deposits and
           marketable debt securities with original maturities over one year for treasury purposes.

12. Fair value measurement
   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
   orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability
   of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to
   measure fair value:

   Level 1         —    Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in
                        active markets.

   Level 2         —    Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1,
                        such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices
                        for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other
                        inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

   Level 3         —    Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions, consistent with
                        reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These
                        valuations require significant judgment.


   Fair value of listed equity investments are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
   liabilities. The valuation of unlisted equity investments that do not have a quoted price may include the
   use of market and income valuation approaches and the use of estimates, which may include discount
   rates, investees’ liquidity and financial performance, and market data of comparable companies in
   similar industries. Certain other financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts and certain
   option agreements, are valued based on inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market
   data. Valuations of convertible and exchangeable bonds that do not have a quoted price are generally
   performed using valuation models such as the binomial model with unobservable inputs including
   risk-free interest rate and expected volatility. The valuation of contingent consideration is performed
   using an expected cash flow method with unobservable inputs including the probability to achieve
   the contingencies, which is assessed by the Company, in connection with the contingent consideration
   arrangements. Investments in privately held companies for which the Company elected to record using
   the measurement alternative are remeasured on a non-recurring basis, and are categorized within Level 3
   under the fair value hierarchy. The values are estimated based on valuation methods using the observable
   transaction price at the transaction date and considering the rights and obligations of the securities and
   other unobservable inputs including volatility.

    business combinations, which were measured at fair value upon acquisition. Details of intangible assets
    acquired in connection with business combinations are included in Note 4.

    During the year ended March 31, 2024, considered lower than expected profitability as a result of
    uncertainties in the market environment, the Company recognized impairment on intangible assets of
    RMB12,089 million primarily relating to trade names, trademarks and domain names originated from
    the acquisition of Sun Art, an asset group under All others segment. The fair value of the asset group is
    determined based on its market capitalization.

    The estimated aggregate amortization expenses for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter
    are as follows:

           (i) As of the annual goodwill impairment assessment date, considered the changes in market conditions, the Company
               performed a quantitative impairment test on Youku, a reporting unit under Digital Media and Entertainment Group and
               recognized an impairment charge of RMB8,490 million. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on the
               discounted cash flow analysis using the assumptions including the future growth rates and the weighted average cost of
               capital.

           Gross goodwill balances were RMB300,425 million and RMB302,534 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2024,
           respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were RMB32,334 million and RMB42,855 million as of March
           31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

           In the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of
           certain reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and recorded impairment losses of RMB25,141
           million, RMB2,714 million and RMB10,521 million during the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024,
           respectively. The goodwill impairment is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information
           (Note 26) because the CODM of the Company does not consider this as part of the segment operating
           performance measure.

18. Deferred revenue and customer advances
   Deferred revenue and customer advances primarily represent service fees prepaid by merchants or
   customers for which the relevant services have not been provided. The respective balances are as follows:

                                                                                     As of March 31,

                                                                                    74,855             76,887

   All service fees received in advance are initially recorded as customer advances. These amounts are
   transferred to deferred revenue upon commencement of the provision of services by the Company and
   are recognized in the consolidated income statements in the period in which the services are provided. In
   general, service fees received in advance are non-refundable after the amounts are transferred to deferred
   revenue. Substantially all of the balances of deferred revenue and customer advances are generally
   recognized as revenue within one year.

      22. Related party transactions (Continued)

           Transactions with other investees (Continued)
           The Company’s ecosystem offers different platforms on which different enterprises operate and the

           based on normal commercial negotiation with similar unrelated parties.

           Other than the transactions disclosed above or elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements, the
           Company has commercial arrangements with other investees and other related parties to provide and

           acquisitions and equity investments were entered into by the parties involved and conducted on fair value
           basis. The significant acquisitions and equity investments together with related parties are included in Note
           4.

      23. Restricted net assets
           PRC laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the
           PRC only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards
           and regulations. In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are required to annually
           appropriate 10% of their net income to the statutory reserve prior to payment of any dividends, unless the
           reserve has reached 50% of their respective registered capital. Furthermore, registered share capital and
           capital reserve accounts are also restricted from distribution. As a result of the restrictions described above
           and elsewhere under PRC laws and regulations, the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are

       More than 5 years                                                                 6                2

                                                                                     2023              2024
                                                                                      RMB               RMB

       No later than 1 year                                                        37,210             40,243
       Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years                                 21,288             21,471
       More than 5 years                                                             3,559             4,366
                                                                                   62,057             66,080

      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      (For the Years Ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024)



      25. Risks and contingencies
           (a)   The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and considered as a foreign entity under PRC
                 laws. Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
                 added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
                 the Company operates its Internet businesses and other businesses through various contractual
                 arrangements with VIEs that are incorporated and owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned
                 and/or controlled by PRC citizens. The VIEs hold the licenses and approvals that are essential for
                 their business operations in the PRC and the Company has entered into various agreements with the
                 VIEs and their equity holders such that the Company has the right to benefit from their licenses and
                 approvals and generally has control of the VIEs. In the Company’s opinion, the current ownership
                 structure and the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders as well as the
                 operations of the VIEs are in substantial compliance with all existing PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                 However, there may be changes and other developments in PRC laws, rules and regulations.
                 Accordingly, the Company gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view
                 in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of
                 the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found
                 to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct
                 its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership
                 structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in
                 deconsolidation of the VIEs.

           (b)   The PRC market in which the Company operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks
                 and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of the Company to operate or invest
                 in online and mobile commerce or other Internet related businesses, representing the principal
                 services provided by the Company, in the PRC. The information and technology industries are highly
                 regulated. Restrictions are currently in place or are unclear regarding what specific segments of
                 these industries foreign owned enterprises, like the Company, may operate. If new or more extensive
                 restrictions were imposed on the segments in which the Company is permitted to operate, the
                 Company could be required to sell or cease to operate or invest in some or all of its current businesses
                 in the PRC. These uncertainties also extend to the PRC’s regulations relating to anti-monopoly and
                 anti-unfair competition. In December 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation of the
                 PRC (the “SAMR”) commenced an investigation on the Company pursuant to the PRC Anti-monopoly
                 Law. Following the investigation, in April 2021, the SAMR issued an administrative penalty decision
                 of the anti-monopoly investigation into the Company and imposed a fine of RMB18.2 billion, which
                 was accrued for as of March 31, 2021. The amount had been paid as of March 31, 2022. The SAMR
                 also issued an administrative guidance, instructing the Company to implement a comprehensive
                 rectification program, and to file a self-assessment and compliance report to the SAMR for three
                 consecutive years.

           (c)   Because of the Company’s equity interest in and close association with Ant Group and overlapping
                 user bases, regulatory developments, litigation or proceedings, media and other reports, whether or
                 not true, and other events that affect Ant Group could also negatively affect customers’, regulators’,
                 investors’ and other third parties’ perception of the Company. In April 2021, Ant Group announced
                 that it would apply to set up a financial holding company to ensure its financial-related businesses
                 are fully regulated. To implement the rectification plan and comply with applicable new measures
                 and rules, Ant Group may be required to spend significant time and resources and make changes
                 to its businesses, which could materially and adversely affect its business operations and growth
                 prospects. In July 2023, PRC regulators announced a RMB7.07 billion fine for Ant Group, which was
                 also reflected in the Company’s share of results of equity method investees during the year ended

                 Ant Group’s business and future prospects, or speculation of such changes, as well as additional
                 regulatory requirements placed on Ant Group, could in turn have a material adverse effect on the
                 Company.

                                                            (For the Years Ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024)



25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (d)   The Company’s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a
         significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely
         convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to
         be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People’s Bank of
         China (the “PBOC”).

         Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in the PRC must be processed through the
         PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory bodies and require certain supporting documentation
         in order to effect the remittance. If the foreign exchange control system prevents the Company from
         obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able
         to pay dividends in foreign currencies and the Company’s ability to fund its business activities that are
         conducted in foreign currencies could be adversely affected.

   (e)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes strategic investments to increase the service
         offerings and expand capabilities. The Company continually reviews its investments to determine
         whether there is a decline in fair value below the carrying value. Fair value of the listed securities is
         subject to volatility and may be materially affected by market fluctuations.

   (f)   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk
         consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and equity
         securities and other investments. As of March 31, 2023 and 2024, substantially all of the Company’s
         cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and other treasury investments
         were held by major financial institutions located worldwide, including Chinese mainland and Hong
         Kong S.A.R. If the financial institutions and other issuers of financial instruments held by the Company
         could become insolvent or if the markets for these instruments could become illiquid as a result of a
         severe economic downturn, the Company could lose some or all of the value of its investments.

   (g)   During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company offered a trade assurance
         program on the international wholesale marketplaces at no charge to the wholesale buyers and
         sellers. If the wholesale sellers who participate in this program do not deliver the products in their
         stated specifications to the wholesale buyers on schedule, the Company may compensate the
         wholesale buyers for their losses on behalf of the wholesale sellers up to a pre-determined amount
         following a review of each particular case. In turn, the Company will seek a full reimbursement
         from the wholesale sellers for the prepaid reimbursement amount, yet the Company is exposed
         to a risk over the collectability of the reimbursement from the wholesale sellers. During the years
         ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company did not incur any material losses with respect
         to the compensation provided under this program. Given that the maximum compensation for each
         wholesale seller is pre-determined based on their individual risk assessments by the Company
         considering their credit profile or other relevant information, the Company determined that the
         likelihood of material default on the payments are not probable and therefore no provisions have
         been made in relation to this program.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report    331

      25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
           (h)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
                 and litigations in relation to disputes relating to trademarks and other intellectual property, among
                 others. In 2017, Beijing Jingdong Shiji Trading Co., Ltd. and Beijing Jingdong 360 E-commerce Co., Ltd.
                 sued Tmall China, Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Limited for abuse of
                 dominant market position. The plaintiffs requested the three defendants to cease relevant acts and
                 claimed a substantial amount of damages in the original complaint. In March 2021, the plaintiffs
                 amended their claim to seek higher damages. In December 2023, the Beijing High People’s Court
                 issued a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and the Company has appealed the court judgment. As
                 of March 31, 2024, the case is in second-instance stage. The Company has accrued for the potential
                 damages in connection with this lawsuit. Except for the above, there are no legal proceedings and
                 litigations that have in the recent past had, or to the Company’s knowledge, are probable to have, a
                 material impact on the Company’s financial positions, results of operations or cash flows. Except for
                 the above, the Company did not accrue any material loss contingencies in this respect as of March 31,
                 2023 and 2024.

           (i)   The Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in significant disruptions to supply chains, logistics and
                 business activities in the region that has negatively affected our international commerce business
                 and Cainiao’s international logistics business. The conflict has also caused, and continues to intensify,
                 significant geopolitical tensions in Europe and across the globe. The resulting sanctions imposed
                 are expected to have significant impacts on the economic conditions of the countries and markets
                 targeted by such sanctions, and may have unforeseen, unpredictable secondary effects on global
                 energy prices, supply chains and other aspects of the global economy. The conflict may adversely
                 affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

           (j)   The United Nations and a number of countries and jurisdictions, including China, the United States
                 and the EU, have adopted various export control and economic or trade sanction regimes. In
                 particular, the United States government and other governments have increasingly threatened and/
                 or imposed export control, as well as economic trade and other sanctions on a number of China-
                 based companies. In October 2023, the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry
                 and Security released additional rules that became effective in November 2023, expanding and
                 strengthening export control measures to further restrict China’s access to advanced computing chips
                 and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The United States and other countries may impose
                 other and more expansive restrictions on the sales of chips or other technologies to China and China-
                 based companies, including the Company, in future.

26. Segment information
   Starting from the year ended March 31, 2024, the CODM started to review information under a new
   reporting structure. Accordingly, segment reporting has been updated to conform to these changes and
   segment information has been updated to be presented before elimination of inter-segment transactions.
   Comparative figures for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2023 were updated to conform to the
   segment presentation for the year ended March 31, 2024.

   In general, revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses are directly attributable, or are allocated, to
   each segment. The Company allocates costs and expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific
   segment, such as those that support infrastructure across different segments, to different segments mainly
   on the basis of usage, revenue or headcount, depending on the nature of the relevant costs and expenses.
   The Company does not allocate assets to its segments as the CODM does not evaluate the performance of
   segments using asset information.

   The following table presents the summary of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization
   (“Adjusted EBITA”) for each segment which is considered as a segment operating performance measure,
   for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024:

29. Reconciliation between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
    Standards (Continued)
    (i) Consolidation and business combinations
        The Company consolidates an entity when the Company obtains control over the entity. Under U.S. GAAP, control generally
        exists when the Company obtains a controlling financial interest over an entity, whereby the usual condition is ownership
        of over 50% of the voting shares. Under IFRS, de facto control exists when the Company has the practical ability to direct
        the relevant activities of the entity, even if the Company owns less than 50% of the voting shares, which results in a
        difference in the timing of consolidation between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
        The Company recognizes noncontrolling interests to reflect the portion of equity of a subsidiary that is not attributable
        to the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value and full goodwill in relation to the
        acquiree is recognized in a business combination. Under IFRS, the Company can elect, on a transaction-by-transaction
        basis, to measure noncontrolling interests at the noncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s net
        identifiable assets and partial goodwill is recognized to reflect the controlling interests only.
    (ii) Equity securities without readily determinable fair value
        Under U.S. GAAP, the Company can elect, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to apply the measurement alternative
        to record the investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, with
        subsequent adjustments for observable price changes recognized in the consolidated income statements. Under IFRS,
        these investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated income statements.
    (iii) Equity method investments
        The Company generally applies the equity method to account for equity investments over which it has significant influence.
        Under U.S. GAAP, significant influence is presumed to exist for an investment in limited partnership or unincorporated
        entity, unless the investment is so minor that the Company has virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and
        financial policies. Under IFRS, significant influence is presumed to exist for an investment of over 20% of the voting rights of
        an entity.
        The Company records its share of the post-acquisition results of its equity method investees and adjusts for the basis
        differences that exist between the carrying values of the equity method investments and the Company’s proportionate
        share of the carrying value of the investee’s net assets. Adjustments are made to the financial statements of the equity
        method investees prepared under U.S. GAAP in order to conform to the Company’s accounting policies under IFRS and to
        reflect the basis differences of the equity method investments under IFRS, if different from those under U.S. GAAP.
    (iv) Share-based awards
        The employees of the Company hold share-based awards relating to an equity method investee of the Company that were
        granted and will be settled by related parties or economic interest holders of the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, the cost
        related to these awards is recognized over the requisite service period, with subsequent changes in fair value of these
        awards recognized in the consolidated income statements. Under IFRS, these awards are not considered as share based
        payments of the Company and the cost relating to these awards is not recognized.
        The Company accounts for income tax effects of share-based awards that ordinarily give rise to tax deduction. Under
        U.S. GAAP, deferred taxes for these awards are measured based on share-based compensation expenses recognized in
        the consolidated financial statements. Under IFRS, deferred taxes for these awards are measured based on future tax
        deduction estimated at the end of each reporting period.
    (v) Leases
        Under U.S. GAAP, the amortization of right-of-use assets and the interest expense related to lease liabilities are recorded
        together as lease expense and recognized in the consolidated income statements on a straight-line basis. Under IFRS,
        the right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis while the interest expense related to lease liabilities are
        recognized in the consolidated income statements using effective interest method.
    (vi) Redeemable noncontrolling interests
        Equity interests issued by certain subsidiaries of the Company are redeemable. Under U.S. GAAP, redeemable equity
        interests are classified as mezzanine equity if the redemption is outside the Company’s control and as noncontrolling
        interests if equity interests issued by finite-lived subsidiaries are mandatorily redeemable only upon liquidation. Under
        IFRS, these redeemable equity interests are generally classified as financial liabilities.
    (vii) Hyperinflation
        Under U.S. GAAP, when the Company determines that a subsidiary is operating in a highly inflationary economy, the
        financial statements of this subsidiary are remeasured prospectively as if its functional currency was the functional
