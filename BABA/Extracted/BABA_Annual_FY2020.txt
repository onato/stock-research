(1) We received the 33% equity interest in Ant Group on September 23, 2019. Similar to other equity investees, we record our share of
    results of Ant Group one quarter in arrears. As such, the share of profit of Ant Group in fiscal year 2020 reflects our share of profit of
    Ant Group for the period from the day following receipt of the equity interest to the end of the quarter on December 31, 2019.

The year-over-year decrease in share of results of                       Net Income

Rule 13.25B of the Hong Kong Listing Rules requires
a listed issuer to publish a monthly return in relation
to movements in its equity securities, debt securities
and any other securitized instruments, as applicable,

subject to satisfying the waiver condition that the SFC
has granted a partial exemption from strict compliance
with Part XV of the SFO (other than Divisions 5, 11

of shareholders’ interests. As we have obtained a

any, in our quarterly earnings releases and annual

      Report of Independent Registered Public
      Accounting Firm




      To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alibaba Group Holding Limited

      Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its subsidiaries (the
      “Company”) as of March 31, 2019 and 2020, and the related consolidated income statements, consolidated statements
      of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
      March 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also
      have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established
      in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
      Treadway Commission (COSO).

      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2019 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
      each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
      in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
      Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

      Change in Accounting Principle
      As discussed in Note 2(t) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
      for its investments in equity securities for the year ended March 31, 2019.

      Basis for Opinions
      The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
      control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
      included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under the section of
      “Controls and Procedures” in the Company’s annual report. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
      are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
      and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
      the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
      material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
      maintained in all material respects.




288   Alibaba Group Holding Limited
                      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded
HQG, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Kaola”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of March
31, 2020, because it was acquired by the Company in a business combination during the year ended March 31, 2020.
We have also excluded Kaola from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Kaola is wholly owned by the
Company, and its total assets and total revenue, which were excluded from management’s assessment and our audit
of internal control over financial reporting, represented less than 1% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.




                                                                                          Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report      289
      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



      Impairment Assessment on Goodwill Allocated to Reporting Units under the Digital Media and
      Entertainment Segment
      As described in Note 2(z) and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s balance of goodwill
      allocated to reporting units under the Digital Media and Entertainment Segment as of March 31, 2020 was RMB58,673
      million. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of RMB576 million
      on goodwill allocated to one of those reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more
      frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. The Company has elected to first
      perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment testing is
      necessary. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and
      market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting units, and other specific information related to the
      operations, business plans and strategies of the reporting units, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19
      pandemic. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
      than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed.

      The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessment
      on goodwill allocated to reporting units under the Digital Media and Entertainment Segment is a critical audit matter are
      that there was significant judgment and estimation by management when performing the qualitative assessment, which
      in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit
      evidence relating to the factors considered in management’s qualitative assessment.

      Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
      overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
      relating to management’s impairment assessment on goodwill allocated to reporting units under the Digital Media and
      Entertainment Segment, including controls over management’s evaluation of the factors considered in the qualitative
      assessment. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s qualitative assessment, which
      included evaluating the factors considered by management, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
      considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting units, implied value of the reporting units with reference to
      quoted market price of comparable companies, and other specific information related to the operations, business plans
      and strategies of the reporting units, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Valuation of Intangible Assets Acquired in Connection with Business Combinations
      As described in Note 2(x) and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded RMB5,626 million
      of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with business combinations during the year ended March 31, 2020,
      which were measured at fair value upon acquisition primarily using valuation techniques under the income approach.
      Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangible assets include future growth rates and weighted
      average cost of capital.

      The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of intangible
      assets acquired in connection with business combinations is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment
      and estimation by management when determining the fair values of these intangible assets, which in turn led to a high
      degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to
      the valuation techniques and the significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair value of these
      intangible assets, including future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital.

      Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
      overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
      relating to the acquisition accounting in connection with business combinations, including controls over management’s
      identification of the intangible assets and controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to
      the valuation of these intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others, reading the share purchase
      agreements and testing the fair values of the intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations as
      determined by management, which included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques, (ii) testing

adopted in the income approach, and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions, including future growth rates and
weighted average cost of capital. Evaluating the reasonableness of the future growth rates for the forecast period involved
considering the past performance of the acquired businesses as well as economic and industry forecasts. The weighted
average cost of capital was evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and other industry
factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the
future growth rate for terminal value and the weighted average cost of capital used by management.

Fair Value Determination Related to Investments in Privately Held Companies Accounted for
Using the Measurement Alternative
As described in Note 2(t) and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s investments in privately
held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative were RMB80,939 million as of March 31, 2020.
The Company recorded these investments at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for observable price
changes resulting from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The fair value of these
investments with observable price changes is determined based on valuation methods using the observable transaction
price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, as well as rights and obligations of the
securities.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value determination
related to investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative is a critical audit
matter are that there was significant judgment and estimation by management when determining the fair value of these
investments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s assessment of whether the observable transaction is orderly and
similar to the Company’s investment and management’s determination of the fair value adjustments.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming
our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to fair value determination of these investments in privately held companies, including controls over
management’s assessment of whether the observable transaction is orderly and similar to the Company’s investment and
controls over the determination of the fair value adjustments. These procedures also included, among others, testing
the fair value of these investments as determined by management, which included (i) evaluating whether the observable
transaction is orderly and similar to the Company’s investment, (ii) testing the completeness, mathematical accuracy and
relevance of key underlying data used in the valuation, and (iii) evaluating the unobservable inputs, including volatility
as well as rights and obligations of the securities, as used in the valuation. The volatility was evaluated by considering
the external market and industry data of comparable businesses. The rights and obligations of the securities were
evaluated by reading the investment agreements. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in
evaluating the reasonableness of the volatility used by management as well as the rights and obligations of the securities.

Investment in Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”)
As described in Note 4(l) to the consolidated financial statements, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions in
September 2019, the Company received the 33% equity interest in Ant Group pursuant to the share and asset purchase
agreement (together with all subsequent amendments, the “SAPA”). Under the SAPA, the consideration to acquire the
newly issued 33% equity interest in Ant Group was fully funded by concurrent payments from Ant Group to the Company
in consideration for certain intellectual property rights and assets that the Company transferred to Ant Group upon the
issuance of the equity interest. The Company accounts for its equity interest in Ant Group under the equity method.
Upon the receipt of the equity interest in September 2019, the investment was initially measured at cost, with an upward
adjustment determined based on the fair value of the Company’s share of Ant Group’s net assets as of the completion
date of the transaction. Upon the completion, the Company recorded the 33% equity interest in Ant Group with a
carrying value amounting to RMB90.7 billion in investment in equity investees, other cost reimbursement of RMB0.6
billion from Ant Group to the Company pursuant to the SAPA and the deferred tax effect of RMB19.7 billion, with a
corresponding gain of RMB71.6 billion recorded in interest and investment income, net in the year ended March 31,
2020. The application of accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and
the recognition of the upward adjustment require significant management judgment, which included (i) determination

      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



      of the contract inception date of the SAPA for the initial measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and (ii)
      determination of the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s
      net assets acquired and the cost of investment when the former is greater than the latter. Management considered the
      relevant U.S. GAAP guidance, and focused on the legal enforceability of the agreement, and determined that the contract
      inception date was in 2014. In the absence of specific guidance and with the diversity in practice, management assessed
      various views derived from the interpretations of relevant U.S. GAAP and made reference to the relevant guidance of
      other international accounting framework, and recognized the difference under interest and investment income, net with
      a corresponding increase to the initial carrying value of the investment in Ant Group.

      The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the investment in Ant Group
      is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment and estimation by management in applying accounting
      principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and recognizing the related gain, which
      in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit
      evidence relating to management’s determination of the contract inception date and the accounting treatment for the
      difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the cost of investment
      when the former is greater than the latter.

      Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
      overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
      relating to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group, including controls over management’s application
      of accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the recognition of
      the related gain. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s determination of the contract
      inception date and the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant
      Group’s net assets acquired and the cost of investment. Evaluating management’s determination of the contract inception
      date included (i) evaluating management’s assessment of when the legally enforceable right first exists and (ii) evaluating
      Ant Group’s obligation and commitment to pursue the regulatory approvals relevant to the transaction. Evaluating the
      accounting treatment for the difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired
      and the cost of investment included obtaining and examining management’s evaluation of the transaction. Professionals
      with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the accounting treatment for the difference between
      the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the cost of investment as determined by
      management.

      1.   Organization and principal activities
           Alibaba Group Holding Limited (the “Company”) is a limited liability company, which was incorporated
           in the Cayman Islands on June 28, 1999. The Company is a holding company and conducts its businesses
           primarily through its subsidiaries. In these consolidated financial statements, where appropriate, the term

           and marketing reach to help merchants, brands and other businesses to leverage the power of new
           technology to engage with their users and customers and operate in a more efficient way. SoftBank Group

           The Company has four operating and reportable segments, namely core commerce, cloud computing,

                                          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                                             For the Years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020




2.   Summary of significant accounting policies

     (a) Basis of presentation
         The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

         Effective on July 30, 2019, the Company subdivided each of its issued and unissued ordinary shares
         into eight ordinary shares (the “Share Subdivision”). Following the Share Subdivision, the Company’s
         authorized share capital became US$100,000 divided into 32,000,000,000 ordinary shares of par
         value US$0.000003125 per share. The number of issued and unissued ordinary shares as disclosed
         elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements are presented on a basis after taking into
         account the effects of the Share Subdivision and have been retrospectively adjusted, where
         applicable.

         Simultaneously with the Share Subdivision, the change in ratio of the Company’s ADS to ordinary
         share (the “ADS Ratio Change”) also became effective. Following the ADS Ratio Change, each
         ADS now represents eight ordinary shares. Previously, each ADS represented one ordinary share.
         Given that the ADS Ratio Change was exactly proportionate to the Share Subdivision, no new ADSs
         were issued to any ADS holder and the total number of the Company’s outstanding ADSs remains
         unchanged immediately after the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change became effective.

         Translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement,
         consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows from
         RMB into the United States Dollar (“US$”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 are solely for
         the convenience of the readers and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB7.0808, representing the
         exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 31, 2020.
         No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or
         settled into US$ at this rate, or at any other rate.

     (b) Use of estimates
         The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
         the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
         statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The
         Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
         believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
         carrying values of assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2020, the Company considered the economic
         implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its significant judgments and estimates. Given the impact
         and other unforeseen effects on the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates
         required increased judgment, and actual results could differ from these estimates.

     (c) Consolidation
         The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its
         subsidiaries, which include the PRC-registered entities directly or indirectly wholly owned by the
         Company (“WFOEs”) and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) over which the Company is the primary
         beneficiary. All transactions and balances among the Company and its subsidiaries have been
         eliminated upon consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are recorded in the
         consolidated income statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of
         disposal, as appropriate.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report    305

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (c) Consolidation (Continued)
                A subsidiary is an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the
                voting power; or (ii) the Company has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members
                of the board of directors or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of the board of directors or
                to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee pursuant to a statute or under an
                agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. A VIE is required to be consolidated by the
                primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity holders in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
                controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
                without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

                Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-added
                telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers, the Company
                operates its Internet and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the
                PRC through certain PRC domestic companies. The equity interests of these PRC domestic companies
                are held by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by PRC citizens. Specifically, these
                PRC domestic companies that are material to the Company’s business are Zhejiang Taobao Network
                Co., Ltd., Zhejiang Tmall Network Co., Ltd., Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd. and Youku Information
                Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The registered capital of these PRC domestic companies was funded by
                the Company through loans extended to the equity holders of these PRC domestic companies.

                The Company has entered into certain exclusive technical services agreements with these PRC
                domestic companies, which entitle it to receive a majority of their residual returns and make it
                obligatory for the Company to absorb a majority of the risk of losses from their activities. In addition,
                the Company has entered into certain agreements with the equity holders of these PRC domestic
                companies, including loan agreements that require them to contribute registered capital to those
                PRC domestic companies, exclusive call option agreements to acquire the equity interests in these
                companies when permitted by the PRC laws, rules and regulations, equity pledge agreements of
                the equity interests held by those equity holders, and proxy agreements that irrevocably authorize
                individuals designated by the Company to exercise the equity owner’s rights over these PRC domestic
                companies.

                Details of the typical structure of the Company’s significant VIEs are set forth below:

                (i)   Contracts that give the Company effective control of VIEs
                      Loan agreements
                      Pursuant to the relevant loan agreements, the respective WFOEs have granted loans to the equity
                      holders of the VIEs, which may only be used for the purpose of its business operation activities
                      agreed by the WFOEs. The WFOEs may require acceleration of repayment at their absolute
                      discretion. When the equity holders of the VIEs make early repayment of the outstanding
                      amount, the WFOEs or a third-party designated by the WFOEs may purchase the equity interests
                      in the VIEs at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the loan, subject to any applicable
                      PRC laws, rules and regulations. The equity holders of the VIEs undertake not to enter into any
                      prohibited transactions in relation to the VIEs, including the transfer of any business, material
                      assets, intellectual property rights or equity interests in the VIEs to any third party.

     (c) Consolidation (Continued)
         (i)   Contracts that give the Company effective control of VIEs (Continued)
               Exclusive call option agreements
               The equity holders of the VIEs have granted the WFOEs exclusive call options to purchase their
               equity interest in the VIEs at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered
               capital in the VIEs; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each
               relevant VIE has further granted the relevant WFOE an exclusive call option to purchase its assets
               at an exercise price equal to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by
               applicable PRC laws, whichever is higher. Certain VIEs and their equity holders will also jointly
               grant the WFOEs (A) exclusive call options to request the VIEs to decrease their registered capital
               at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the paid-in registered capital in the VIEs and (ii)
               the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws (the “Capital Decrease Price”), and (B)
               exclusive call options to subscribe for the increased capital of the VIEs at a price equal to the
               sum of the Capital Decrease Price and the unpaid registered capital, if applicable, as of the
               capital decrease. The WFOEs may nominate another entity or individual to purchase the equity
               interest or assets, or to subscribe for the increased capital, if applicable, under the call options.
               Execution of each call option shall not violate the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations.
               Each equity holder of the VIE has agreed that the following amounts, to the extent in excess of
               the original registered capital that they contributed to the VIE (after deduction of relevant tax
               expenses), belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity
               interests in the VIE, (ii) proceeds received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIE, and
               (iii) distributions or liquidation residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIE upon
               termination or liquidation. Moreover, any profits, distributions or dividends (after deduction of
               relevant tax expenses) received by the VIEs also belong to and shall be paid to the WFOEs. The
               exclusive call option agreements remain in effect until the equity interest or assets that are the
               subject of these agreements are transferred to the WFOEs.

               Proxy agreements
               Pursuant to the relevant proxy agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs irrevocably authorize
               any person designated by the WFOEs to exercise their rights as the equity holders of the VIEs,
               including without limitation the right to vote and appoint directors.

               Equity pledge agreements
               Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the equity holders of the VIEs have pledged
               all of their interests in the equity of the VIEs as a continuing first priority security interest in favor
               of the corresponding WFOEs to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant
               loan agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the VIEs
               and/or the equity holders under the other structure contracts. Each WFOE is entitled to exercise
               its right to dispose of the pledged interests in the equity of the VIE held by the equity holders
               and has priority in receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of
               the pledged interests, in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other
               structure contracts, if applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until the later
               of (i) the full performance of the contractual arrangements by the relevant parties, and (ii) the
               full repayment of the loans made to the equity holders of the VIEs.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (c) Consolidation (Continued)
                (ii)   Contracts that enable the Company to receive substantially all of the economic benefits
                       from the VIEs
                       Exclusive technology services agreements or exclusive services agreements
                       Each relevant VIE has entered into an exclusive technology services agreement or an exclusive
                       services agreement with the respective WFOE, pursuant to which the relevant WFOE provides
                       exclusive services to the VIE. In exchange, the VIE pays a service fee to the WFOE, the amount of
                       which shall be determined, to the extent permitted by applicable PRC laws as proposed by the
                       WFOE, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits from the VIE to the WFOE.

                       Other arrangements
                       The exclusive call option agreements described above also entitle the WFOEs to all profits,
                       distributions or dividends (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by the VIEs,
                       and the following amounts, to the extent in excess of the original registered capital that they
                       contributed to the VIEs (after deduction of relevant tax expenses) to be received by each equity
                       holder of the VIEs: (i) proceeds from the transfer of its equity interests in the VIEs, (ii) proceeds
                       received in connection with a capital decrease in the VIEs, and (iii) distributions or liquidation
                       residuals from the disposal of its equity interests in the VIEs upon termination or liquidation.

                Based on these contractual agreements, the Company believes that the PRC domestic companies as
                described above should be considered as VIEs because the equity holders do not have significant
                equity at risk nor do they have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Given that the
                Company is the primary beneficiary of these PRC domestic companies, the Company believes that
                these VIEs should be consolidated based on the structure as described above.

                The following financial information of the VIEs in the PRC was recorded in the accompanying
                consolidated financial statements:

                                                                                                  As of March 31,

         (i) Revenue generated by the VIEs are primarily from cloud computing services, digital media and entertainment
             services, local consumer services and others.

         The VIEs did not have any material related party transactions except for the related party transactions
         which are disclosed in Note 22 or elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, and those
         transactions with other subsidiaries that are not VIEs, which were eliminated upon consolidation.

         Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of
         the VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company
         considers that there is no asset in any of the VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the
         VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all VIEs are incorporated as limited
         liability companies under the Company Law of the PRC, creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to
         the general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the VIEs.

         Currently there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional
         financial support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based on
         the licenses and approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to provide
         financial support to the VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs, as well as the
         Company’s own business objectives in the future.

         Unrecognized revenue-producing assets held by the VIEs include certain Internet content provision
         and other licenses, domain names and trademarks. The Internet content provision and other licenses
         are required under relevant PRC laws, rules and regulations for the operation of Internet businesses
         in the PRC, and therefore are integral to the Company’s operations. The Internet content provision
         licenses require that core PRC trademark registrations and domain names are held by the VIEs that
         provide the relevant services.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (d) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests
                The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in
                accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations.” The cost of
                an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred
                to the sellers, liabilities incurred by the Company and equity instruments issued by the Company.
                Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets
                acquired and liabilities assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition
                date, irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of
                acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously
                held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree
                is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the
                subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income statements.
                During the measurement period, which can be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company
                may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset
                to goodwill. Subsequent to the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the
                values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any further adjustments are
                recorded in the consolidated income statements.

                In a business combination achieved in stages, the Company re-measures the previously held equity
                interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the
                re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated income statements.

                When there is a change in ownership interests or a change in contractual arrangements that results in
                a loss of control of a subsidiary, the Company deconsolidates the subsidiary from the date control is
                lost. Any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and is
                included in the calculation of the gain or loss upon deconsolidation of the subsidiary.

                For the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to
                reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. When the
                noncontrolling interest is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of a conditional event, which
                is not solely within the control of the Company, the noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine
                equity. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date that it
                becomes probable that the mezzanine equity will become redeemable to the earliest redemption date
                using the effective interest method. Consolidated net income in the consolidated income statements
                includes net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and mezzanine equity holders when
                applicable.

                Net loss attributable to mezzanine equity holders is included in net loss attributable to noncontrolling
                interests in the consolidated income statements, while it is excluded from the consolidated statements
                of changes in shareholders’ equity. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, net loss
                attributable to mezzanine equity holders amounted to RMB930 million, RMB438 million and RMB124
                million, respectively. The cumulative results of operations attributable to noncontrolling interests,
                along with adjustments for share-based compensation expense arising from outstanding share-
                based awards relating to subsidiaries’ shares, are also recorded as noncontrolling interests on the
                Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows related to transactions with noncontrolling
                interests are presented under financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (e) Segment reporting
           Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to
           the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), which is comprised of certain members of the
           Company’s management team. The Company had four operating and reportable segments during the
           periods presented as set out in Notes 1 and 26.

     (f)   Foreign currency translation
           The functional currency of the Company is US$. The Company’s subsidiaries with operations in
           mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administration Region of the PRC (“Hong Kong” or “Hong
           Kong S.A.R.”), the United States and other jurisdictions generally use their respective local currencies
           as their functional currencies. The reporting currency of the Company is RMB as the major operations
           of the Company are within the PRC. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than
           the subsidiaries with the functional currency of RMB, are translated into RMB using the exchange rate
           as of the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and the average daily exchange rate for each
           month for income and expense items. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
           comprehensive income or loss as a component of shareholders’ equity.

           In the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than the
           functional currency are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate
           in effect at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
           are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
           currency using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising from foreign
           currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated income statements during the year in which
           they occur.

     (g) Revenue recognition
           In April 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from
           Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” including related amendments and implementation guidance
           within ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 (collectively, including
           ASU 2014-09, “ASC 606”), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).

           ASC 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605 and requires entities to
           recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
           amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
           goods or services. The Company adopted ASC 606 beginning on April 1, 2018 using the modified
           retrospective method applied to those contracts with the customers which were not completed as of
           April 1, 2018.

           Results for reporting periods beginning on April 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior
           period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605.
           The impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to the consolidated financial
           statements and there was no adjustment to the beginning retained earnings on April 1, 2018.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                Revenue is principally comprised of customer management revenue, commissions on transactions,
                membership fees, logistics services revenue, cloud computing services revenue, sales of goods
                and other revenue. Revenue represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to
                upon the transfer of promised goods or services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities
                and is recorded net of value-added tax (“VAT”). Consistent with the criteria of ASC 606 “Revenue
                from Contracts with Customers,” the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations
                are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance
                obligations that are satisfied at a point in time, the Company also considers the following indicators
                to assess whether control of a promised good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to
                payment, (ii) legal title, (iii) physical possession, (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership
                and (v) acceptance of the good or service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, the
                Company recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a
                performance obligation.

                For revenue arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations such as the sale of
                proprietary cloud services packages, which include hardware, software license, software installation
                service, and maintenance service, each distinct performance obligation is separately accounted
                for and the total consideration is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative
                standalone selling price at contract inception.

                The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction to determine whether revenue
                should be recorded on a gross or net basis. The Company is acting as the principal if it obtains control
                over the goods and services before they are transferred to customers. When the Company is primarily
                obligated in a transaction, is generally subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, or
                has several but not all of these indicators, the Company acts as the principal and revenue is recorded
                on a gross basis. When the Company is not primarily obligated in a transaction, does not generally
                bear the inventory risk and does not have the ability to establish the price, the Company acts as the
                agent and revenue is recorded on a net basis.

                When services are exchanged or swapped for other services, revenue is recognized based on the
                estimated standalone selling price of services promised to customer if the fair value of the services
                received cannot be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized for barter transactions
                was not material for each of the periods presented.

               Practical expedients and exemptions
                The Company applies the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
                obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts for
                which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services
                performed.

                The Company does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised
                goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a result, the
                Company applies the practical expedient and does not adjust any of the transaction price for the time
                value of money.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         Revenue recognition policies by type are as follows:

         (i)   Customer management revenue
               Within the core commerce segment, the Company provides the following customer management
               services to merchants on the Company’s retail and wholesale marketplaces and certain third-
               party marketing affiliates’ websites:
               Pay-for-performance (“P4P”) marketing services
               P4P marketing services allow merchants to bid for keywords that match product or service
               listings appearing in search results on the Company’s marketplaces. Merchants bid for keywords
               through an online auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning
               are determined through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a
               market-based mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for P4P marketing services and the
               related revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the
               point of time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.
               In-feed marketing services
               In-feed marketing services allow merchants to bid to market to groups of consumers with similar
               profiles that match product or service listings appearing in browser results on the Company’s
               marketplaces. Merchants bid for groups of consumers with similar profiles through an online
               auction system. The positioning of the listings and the price for the positioning are determined
               through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based
               mechanism. In general, merchants prepay for in-feed marketing services and the related
               revenue is recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the point of
               time when the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered.
               Display marketing services
               Display marketing services allow merchants to place advertisements on the Company’s
               marketplaces, at fixed prices or prices established by a market-based bidding system and
               in particular formats. In general, merchants need to prepay for display marketing which is
               accounted for as customer advances and revenue is recognized either ratably over the period in
               which the advertisement is displayed as the merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as
               the advertisement is displayed or when an advertisement is viewed by users, depending on the
               type of marketing services selected by the merchants.
               The Company also places P4P marketing services content and display marketing content through
               the third-party marketing affiliate program. A substantial portion of customer management
               revenue generated through the third-party marketing affiliate program represented P4P
               marketing services revenue. In delivery of these customer management services, the Company,
               through the third-party marketing affiliate program, places the P4P marketing services content
               of the participating merchants on third-party online resources in the forms of picture or text links
               through contextual relevance technology to match merchants’ marketing content to the textual
               content of the third-party online resources and the users’ attributes based on the Company’s
               systems and algorithms. When the links on third-party online resources are clicked, users are
               diverted to a landing page of the Company’s marketplaces where listings of the participating
               merchant as well as similar products or services of other merchants are presented. In limited
               cases, the Company may embed a search box for one of its marketplaces on the third-party
               online resources, and when a keyword is input into the search box, the user will be diverted to
               the Company’s marketplaces where search results are presented. Revenue is recognized when
               the users further click on the P4P marketing content on the landing pages. The Company places
               display marketing content on third-party online resources in a similar manner. In general,
               merchants need to prepay for display marketing which is accounted for as customer advances
               and revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed as
               merchants simultaneously consume the benefits as the advertisement is displayed.

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
                (i)    Customer management revenue (Continued)
                       P4P marketing services revenue, in-feed marketing services revenue, as well as display
                       marketing revenue generated on the Company’s marketplaces or through the third-party
                       marketing affiliate program are recorded on a gross basis when the Company is the principal to
                       the merchants in the arrangements. For third-party marketing affiliates with whom the Company
                       has an arrangement to share the revenue, traffic acquisition cost is also recognized at the same
                       time if the P4P marketing content on the landing page clicked by the users is from merchants
                       participating in the third-party marketing affiliate program.

                       Taobaoke services
                       In addition, the Company offers the Taobaoke program which generates commissions from
                       merchants for transactions completed by consumers sourced from certain third-party marketing
                       affiliates’ websites and mobile apps. The commission rates on Taobaoke are set by the
                       merchants. The Company’s portion of commission revenue is recognized at the time when the
                       underlying transaction is completed and is recorded on a net basis principally because the
                       Company is not the principal as it does not have latitude in establishing prices or does not have
                       inventory risk. In certain occasions where the Company is the principal of the arrangement
                       (such as arrangements where the Company is obligated to pay for website inventory costs in
                       fixed amounts to third-party marketing affiliates regardless of whether commission revenue
                       is generated from these marketing affiliates), the commission revenue is recorded on a gross
                       basis.

                       Within the digital media and entertainment segment, the Company offers P4P marketing services
                       to merchants and marketers on websites and mobile media operated by UCWeb. Revenue is
                       recognized when a user clicks their product or service listings as this is the point of time when
                       the merchants benefit from the marketing services rendered. In addition, marketers can also
                       place advertisements on websites and mobile media operated by UCWeb and Youku’s platforms
                       in different formats, including video, banners, links, logos and buttons. Revenue is recognized
                       ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed as the merchants simultaneously
                       consume the benefits as the advertisement is displayed or when an advertisement is clicked or
                       viewed by users, depending on the type of marketing services selected by the merchants.

                (ii)   Commissions on transactions
                       The Company earns commissions from merchants when transactions are completed on Tmall and
                       certain other retail marketplaces of the Company. The commissions are generally determined as
                       a percentage based on the value of merchandise being sold by the merchants. The commission
                       revenue includes merchant deposits that are expected to be non-refundable and is accounted
                       for as variable consideration (Note 2(ad)). The variable consideration is estimated at contract
                       inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes
                       available. Revenue related to commissions is recognized in the consolidated income statements
                       based on the expected value when the performance obligation is satisfied. Changes to the
                       estimated variable consideration were not material for each of the periods presented.

     (g) Revenue recognition (Continued)
         (iii) Membership fees
               The Company earns membership fees revenue from wholesale sellers in respect of the sale of
               membership packages and subscriptions that allow them to host premium storefronts on the
               Company’s wholesale marketplaces, as well as the provision of other value-added services,
               and from customers in respect of the sale of membership packages which allow them to access
               premium content on Youku’s paid content platforms. These service fees are paid in advance
               for a specific contracted service period. All these fees are initially deferred as deferred revenue
               and customer advances when received and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
               respective service contracts as the services are provided.

         (iv) Logistics services revenue
               The Company earns logistics services revenue from domestic and international one-stop-shop
               logistics services and the supply chain management solutions provided by Cainiao Network
               as well as on-demand delivery services provided by Ele.me. Revenue is recognized at the time
               when the logistics services are provided.

         (v)   Cloud computing services revenue
               The Company earns cloud computing services revenue from the provision of services such as
               elastic computing, database, storage, network virtualization services, large scale computing,
               security, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine learning platform
               and IoT services. These cloud computing services allow customers to use hosted software over
               the contract period without taking possession of the software. Cloud computing services are
               mainly charged on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services
               charged on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related
               to cloud services charged on a consumption basis, such as the quantity of storage or elastic
               computing services used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of the
               resources.

         (vi) Sales of goods
               Revenue from the sales of goods is mainly generated from Freshippo, a unique proprietary
               grocery retail format and new retail pathfinder in the fast-moving consumer goods category,
               Tmall Supermarket, direct import, Lazada and Intime. Revenue from the sales of goods is
               recognized when the control over the promised goods is transferred to customers. Receipts of
               fees in respect of all other incidental goods or services provided by the Company that are distinct
               performance obligations are recognized when the control of the underlying goods or services is
               transferred to the customers. The amounts relating to these incidental services are not material
               to the Company’s total revenue for each of the periods presented.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report    315
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      For the Years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020




      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (h) Cost of revenue
                 Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of inventories, logistics costs, expenses associated with the
                 operation of the Company’s mobile platforms and websites (such as depreciation and maintenance
                 expenses for servers and computers, call centers and other equipment, and bandwidth and co-
                 location fees), staff costs and share-based compensation expense, content costs, traffic acquisition
                 costs, payment processing fees and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to
                 the Company’s principal operations.

           (i)   Product development expenses
                 Product development expenses consist primarily of staff costs and share-based compensation
                 expense for research and development personnel and other expenses that are directly attributable to
                 the development of new technologies and products for the businesses of the Company, such as the
                 development of the Internet infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and
                 networks.

                 The Company expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and implementation
                 phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance of the existing
                 websites or the development of software and website content. Costs incurred in the development
                 phase are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life. However, since the inception of
                 the Company, the amount of costs qualified for capitalization has been insignificant. As a result, all
                 website and software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

           (j)   Sales and marketing expenses
                 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising expenses, promotion
                 expenses, staff costs and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions and other related
                 incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers and merchants.

                 The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and
                 expenses the costs of delivering advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or airtime
                 is used. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled RMB16,814 million, RMB22,013 million and
                 RMB30,949 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

           (k) Share-based compensation
                 Share-based awards granted are measured at fair value on grant date and share-based
                 compensation expense is recognized (i) immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are
                 required, or (ii) using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
                 requisite service period. The fair values of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares are
                 determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying shares and the fair value of share
                 options is generally determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The value is recognized
                 as an expense over the respective service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Share-based
                 compensation expense, when recognized, is charged to the consolidated income statements with the
                 corresponding entry to additional paid-in capital, liability or noncontrolling interests as disclosed in
                 Note 2(d).

                                                              For the Years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020




2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (k) Share-based compensation (Continued)
           On each measurement date, the Company reviews internal and external sources of information to
           assist in the estimation of various attributes to determine the fair value of the share-based awards
           granted by the Company, including the fair value of the underlying shares, expected life and
           expected volatility. The Company recognizes the impact of any revisions to the original forfeiture rate
           assumptions in the consolidated income statements, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

           In April 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2018-07, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
           Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, which expands the scope of
           ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-
           employees. The amendments specify that ASC 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions
           in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor’s own operations
           by issuing share-based payment awards. Upon the adoption of this guidance, the Company no
           longer re-measures equity-classified share-based awards granted to consultants or non-employees
           at each reporting date through the vesting date and the accounting for these share-based awards
           to consultants or non-employees and employees will be substantially aligned. The adoption of this
           guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
           and cash flows. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019
           were not retrospectively adjusted.

     (l)   Other employee benefits
           The Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer
           defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits
           are provided to employees. The relevant labor regulations require the Company’s subsidiaries in
           the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions based on the
           applicable benchmarks and rates stipulated by the local government. The relevant local labor and
           social welfare authorities are responsible for meeting all retirement benefits obligations and the
           Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC have no further commitments beyond their monthly contributions.
           The contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019
           and 2020, contributions to the plan amounting to RMB3,587 million, RMB5,608 million and RMB6,317
           million, respectively, were charged to the consolidated income statements.

           The Company also makes payments to other defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for
           the benefit of employees employed by subsidiaries outside of the PRC. Amounts contributed during
           the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were insignificant.

     (m) Income taxes
           The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income
           taxes are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
           statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
           tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
           the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
           deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes
           the enactment date. Valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
           more likely than not that the asset will not be realizable in the foreseeable future.




                                                                                   Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report    317

           (m) Income taxes (Continued)
                Deferred taxes are recognized on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, which are presumed to
                be transferred to the parent company and are subject to withholding taxes, unless there is sufficient
                evidence to show that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely
                or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. Deferred taxes are also recognized in
                relation to certain equity investees and investment securities.

                The Company adopts ASC 740 “Income Taxes” which prescribes a more likely than not threshold
                for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
                taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
                classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and
                penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income
                tax disclosures. The Company did not have significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any
                unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of and for
                the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

           (n) Government grants
                Government grants are recognized as income in other income, net or as a reduction of specific costs
                and expenses for which the grants are intended to compensate. Such amounts are recognized in the
                consolidated income statements upon receipt and when all conditions attached to the grants are
                fulfilled.

           (o) Leases
                In April 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, including certain transitional
                guidance and subsequent amendments within ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20
                and ASU 2019-01 (collectively, including ASU 2016-02, “ASC 842”).

                ASC 842 supersedes the lease requirements in ASC 840 “Leases”, and generally requires lessees
                to recognize operating and finance lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the
                balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty
                of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits
                and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases as if there was an
                acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease. All other leases
                are accounted for as operating leases. The Company has no significant finance leases.

                The Company adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method by applying
                the new lease standard to all leases existing as of April 1, 2019, the date of initial application, and
                no adjustments were made to the comparative periods. Upon the initial application of ASC 842 on
                April 1, 2019, land use rights, net with a total carrying amount of RMB6,419 million were identified
                as operating lease right-of-use assets (Note 13). Such amount is included in the opening balance of
                operating lease right-of-use assets as of April 1, 2019 with no adjustments made to the comparative
                periods.

                The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance,
                which allowed the Company to carry forward previous lease classification, the assessment on whether
                a contract was or contained a lease, and the initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to
                April 1, 2019. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-
                use assets of approximately RMB24.9 billion and operating lease liabilities of approximately RMB19.4
                billion on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 1, 2019. The adoption of the new lease standard
                does not have any significant impact on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and
                cash flows and there was no adjustment to the beginning retained earnings on April 1, 2019.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (o) Leases (Continued)
         Under ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease
         right-of-use assets are included in non-current prepayments, receivables and other assets (Note 13),
         and operating lease liabilities are included in current accrued expenses, accounts payable and other
         liabilities and other non-current liabilities (Note 19) on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating
         lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present
         value of future lease payments at lease commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset also
         includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and the initial direct costs incurred
         by the lessee and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. As the interest rates implicit in most
         of the leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates based
         on the information available at lease commencement to determine the present value of the future
         lease payments. Operating lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of
         the lease.

         The Company elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for leases of certain asset
         classes such as shops and malls and equipment leases. Lease and non-lease components for leases
         of other asset classes are accounted for separately. The Company also elected not to recognize short-
         term leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less.

     (p) Cash and cash equivalents
         The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
         months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily
         represent bank deposits, fixed deposits with maturities of less than three months and investments in
         money market funds.

     (q) Short-term investments
         Short-term investments consist primarily of investments in fixed deposits with maturities between
         three months and one year and investments in money market funds or other investments that the
         Company has the intention to redeem within one year. As of March 31, 2019 and 2020, the investments
         in fixed deposits that were recorded as short-term investments amounted to RMB961 million and
         RMB19,147 million, respectively.

     (r) Accounts receivable
         Accounts receivable represents the amounts that the Company has an unconditional right to
         consideration. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
         uncollectible receivable amounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon the
         Company’s assessment of various factors including historical experience, the age of the accounts
         receivable balances, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’
         ability to pay.

     (s) Inventories
         Inventories mainly consist of merchandise available for sale. They are accounted for using the
         weighted average cost and stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value
         is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion
         and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report      319

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (t)   Investment securities
                 Investment securities represent the Company’s investments in equity securities that are not accounted
                 for under the equity method, as well as other investments which primarily consist of debt investments.

                 (i)    Equity securities
                        Equity securities not accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with
                        unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements, according to
                        ASC 321 “Investments — Equity Securities”. The Company elected to record a majority of equity
                        investments in privately held companies using the measurement alternative at cost, less
                        impairment, with subsequent adjustments for observable price changes resulting from orderly
                        transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.

                        Equity investments in privately held companies accounted for using the measurement alternative
                        are subject to periodic impairment reviews. The Company’s impairment analysis considers both
                        qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the fair value of these
                        equity securities, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                        In computing realized gains and losses on equity securities, the Company determines cost based
                        on amounts paid using the average cost method. Dividend income is recognized when the right
                        to receive the payment is established.

                        Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10):
                        Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, equity securities that
                        have readily determinable fair values and were not accounted for using the equity method were
                        classified as available-for-sale, and were carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
                        recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders’
                        equity. In addition, the cost method was used to account for certain equity investments in
                        privately held companies that were not accounted for using the equity method. Upon the
                        adoption of ASU 2016-01 in April 2018, the Company carries these equity securities at fair value
                        with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements. Unrealized
                        gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of March 31, 2018 related to
                        equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale, in the amount of RMB8,196 million,
                        net of tax, were reclassified into retained earnings as of April 1, 2018.

                 (ii)   Debt investments
                        Debt investments are generally stated at amortized cost. The maturities of these debt
                        investments generally range from one to ten years. In addition, the Company has elected the fair
                        value option for certain investments including convertible and exchangeable bonds subscribed.
                        The fair value option permits the irrevocable election on an instrument-by-instrument basis
                        at initial recognition or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that
                        instrument. The investments accounted for under the fair value option are carried at fair value
                        with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements. Interest
                        income from debt investments is recognized using the effective interest method which is
                        reviewed and adjusted periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows.

           (u) Investments in equity investees
                 The Company applies the equity method to account for equity investments in common stock or in-
                 substance common stock, according to ASC 323 “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures”,
                 over which it has significant influence but does not own a controlling financial interest, unless the fair
                 value option is elected for an investment.

                 An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward
                 characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity’s common stock. The Company considers
                 subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining
                 whether an investment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity’s common
                 stock.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (u) Investments in equity investees (Continued)
         Under the equity method, the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the equity
         investee is recognized in the consolidated income statements and its share of post-acquisition
         movements in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive
         income. The Company records its share of the results of the equity investees on a one quarter in
         arrears basis. The excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the underlying equity in net
         assets of the equity investee generally represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired. When the
         Company’s share of losses of the equity investee equals or exceeds its interest in the equity investee,
         the Company does not recognize further losses, unless the Company has incurred obligations or made
         payments or guarantees on behalf of the equity investee.

         The Company continually reviews its investments in equity investees to determine whether a decline
         in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The primary factors the Company
         considers in its determination include the financial condition, operating performance and the
         prospects of the equity investee; other company specific information such as recent financing
         rounds; the geographic region, market and industry in which the equity investee operates, including
         consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the length of time that the fair value of
         the investment is below its carrying value. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-
         temporary, the carrying value of the equity investee is written down to fair value.

     (v) Property and equipment, net
         Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
         loss. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with no residual value based on the
         estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range as follows:

         Computer equipment and software                    3 – 5 years
         Furniture, office and transportation equipment     3 – 10 years
         Buildings                                          20 – 50 years
         Property improvements                              shorter of remaining lease period or estimated
                                                            useful life


         Construction in progress represents buildings and related premises under construction, which is
         stated at actual construction cost less any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to
         the respective category of property and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use.

         Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and asset improvements are capitalized.
         The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of or retired are removed from the
         accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated income statements.




                                                                                  Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report   321

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (w) Land use rights
                Land use rights represent lease prepayments to the local government authorities. Prior to the
                initial application of ASC 842 on April 1, 2019, land use rights were carried at cost less accumulated
                amortization and any impairment loss. The cost of lease prepayments is amortized on a straight-
                line basis over a period of 30 – 50 years. As of March 31, 2019, land use rights were presented under
                prepayments, receivables and other assets (Note 13) on the consolidated balance sheet.

                Upon the adoption of ASC 842 (Note 2(o)), land use rights, net with a total carrying amount of
                RMB6,419 million (Note 13) were identified as operating lease right-of-use assets. Such amount
                is included in the opening balance of operating lease right-of-use assets as of April 1, 2019 with
                no adjustments made to the comparative periods. As of March 31, 2020, operating lease right-of-
                use assets were also presented under prepayments, receivables and other assets (Note 13) on the
                consolidated balance sheet.

           (x) Intangible assets other than licensed copyrights
                Intangible assets mainly include those acquired through business combinations and purchased
                intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recognized as
                assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion.
                Intangible assets arising from business combinations are measured at fair value upon acquisition
                using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and ratio analysis with reference to
                comparable companies in similar industries under the income approach, market approach and cost
                approach. Major assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangible assets include
                future growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Purchased intangible assets are initially
                recognized and measured at cost upon acquisition. Separately identifiable intangible assets that have
                determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line
                method as follows:

                User base and customer relationships               1 – 16 years
                Trade names, trademarks and domain names           3 – 20 years
                Developed technology and patents                   2 – 7 years
                Non-compete agreements                             over the contracted term of up to 6 years


           (y) Licensed copyrights
                Licensed copyrights related to titles to movies, television series, variety shows, animations and
                other video content acquired from external parties are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or
                net realizable value. The amortization period for the licensed content vary depending on the type
                of content, which typically ranges from six months to ten years. Licensed copyrights are presented
                on the consolidated balance sheets as current assets under prepayments, receivables and other
                assets, or non-current assets under intangible assets, net, based on estimated time of usage.
                Licensed copyrights are generally amortized using an accelerated method based on historical
                viewership consumption patterns. Estimates of the consumption patterns for licensed copyrights are
                reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
                amortization expenses in connection with the licensed copyrights of RMB6,111 million, RMB11,391
                million and RMB9,390 million were recorded in cost of revenue within the Company’s digital media
                and entertainment segment.

     (y) Licensed copyrights (Continued)
         On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates the program usefulness of its licensed copyrights
         pursuant to the guidance in ASC 920 “Entertainment – Broadcasters,” which provides that the rights be
         reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. When there is a change in
         the expected usage of licensed copyrights, the Company estimates the net realizable value of licensed
         copyrights to determine if any impairment exists. The net realizable value of licensed copyrights is
         determined by estimating the expected cash flows from advertising and membership fees, less any
         direct costs, over the remaining useful lives of the licensed copyrights. The Company estimates these
         cash flows for each category of content separately. Estimates that impact these cash flows include
         anticipated levels of demand for the Company’s advertising services and the expected selling prices
         of the Company’s advertisements on the entertainment distribution platforms. For the years ended
         March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, impairment charges in connection with the licensed copyrights of
         RMB801 million, RMB2,843 million and RMB2,654 million were recorded in cost of revenue within the
         Company’s digital media and entertainment segment.

     (z) Goodwill
         Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable
         tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired entity as a result
         of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested
         for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
         that it might be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether
         it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative
         assessment, the Company considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
         considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information
         related to the operations, business plans and strategies of the reporting unit, including consideration
         of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than
         not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment
         test is performed.

         In performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the first step compares the fair value of each
         reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds
         its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be
         required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares
         the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair
         value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with
         the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of
         the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the
         assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for
         the purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of
         any assets or liabilities. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management
         judgment, including the identification of reporting units, allocation of assets, liabilities and goodwill
         to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.

           (aa) Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and licensed copyrights
                The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
                indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
                be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future
                undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the assets are considered to be
                impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
                assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Impairment of long-lived assets recognized for the years
                ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was nil, nil and RMB874 million, respectively.

           (ab) Derivatives and hedging
                All contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are recognized on the consolidated balance
                sheets as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
                are either recognized periodically in the consolidated income statements or in other comprehensive
                income depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting and
                are so designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.

                In April 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted
                Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities”, including certain transitional guidance and
                subsequent amendments within ASU 2019-04 (collectively,”ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 permits
                a qualitative effectiveness assessment for certain hedges instead of a quantitative test after the
                initial qualification, if the Company can reasonably support an expectation of high effectiveness
                throughout the term of the hedge. Also, for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, if the hedge
                is highly effective, all changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument are recorded
                in other comprehensive income. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on
                the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The consolidated financial
                statements for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 were not retrospectively adjusted.

                To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented
                at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which
                includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge
                effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be effective in accomplishing the objective of
                offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of
                the hedging relationship is evaluated on a prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and
                quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of
                the derivative to those of the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the changes
                in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to that of the hedged item. A
                hedging relationship is considered initially effective if the results of the hedging instrument are within
                a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (ab) Derivatives and hedging (Continued)
         Interest rate swaps
         Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the cash flows attributable
         to recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted payments may qualify as cash flow hedges. The
         Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap floating interest payments related to
         certain borrowings for fixed interest payments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain
         forecasted payments and obligations. For the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, the effective
         portion of changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that were designated and qualified as
         cash flow hedges was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The gain or loss
         relating to the ineffective portion was recognized immediately in interest and investment income,
         net in the consolidated income statements. Upon the adoption of ASU 2017-12 beginning on April 1,
         2019, all changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow
         hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts in accumulated other
         comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged
         forecasted transaction affects earnings both before and after the adoption of ASU 2017-12.

         Forward exchange contracts
         Forward exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the future
         changes in currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations may qualify as net investment
         hedges. The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk
         associated with investments in net assets of certain subsidiaries with operations in the PRC of which
         the functional currency is RMB. For the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, the effective portion
         of the changes in fair value of the forward exchange contracts that were designated and qualified
         as net investment hedges was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income to offset
         the cumulative translation adjustments relating to those subsidiaries. The gain or loss relating to
         the ineffective portion, which was measured based on changes in forward exchange rates, was
         recognized immediately in other income, net in the consolidated income statements. Amounts
         accumulated are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the
         consolidated income statements upon disposal of those subsidiaries. Once the hedge becomes
         ineffective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. During the year ended March 31, 2020,
         there were no forward exchange contracts that were designated and qualified as net investment
         hedges.

         Changes in the fair value of the derivatives not qualified for hedge accounting are reported in the
         consolidated income statements. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is determined based on
         relevant market information. These estimates are calculated with reference to the market rates using
         industry standard valuation techniques.




                                                                                 Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report    325

      2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

           (ac) Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes
                Bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes are recognized initially at fair value, net of upfront
                fees, debt discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees. Upfront fees, debt
                discounts or premiums, debt issuance costs and other incidental fees are recorded as a reduction of
                the proceeds received and the related accretion is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated
                income statements over the estimated term of the facilities using the effective interest method.

           (ad) Merchant deposits
                The Company collects deposits representing an annual upfront service fee from merchants on Tmall
                and AliExpress before the beginning of each calendar year. These deposits are initially recorded as
                a liability by the Company. The deposits are refundable to a merchant if the level of sales volume
                that is generated by that merchant on Tmall or AliExpress meets the target during the period. If the
                transaction volume target is not met at the end of each calendar year, the relevant deposits will
                become non-refundable. These merchant deposits are accounted for as variable consideration at an
                amount that is estimated at contract inception. The estimate is updated at the end of each reporting
                period and when there are changes in circumstances during the reporting period. Merchant deposits
                are recognized as commission revenue in the consolidated income statements when the likelihood of
                refund to the merchant is considered remote based on the patterns of sales volume generated by the
                merchant during the reporting period.

           (ae) Deferred revenue and customer advances
                Deferred revenue and customer advances generally represent cash received from customers
                that relate to goods or services to be provided in the future. Deferred revenue, mainly relating to
                membership fees and cloud computing services revenue, is stated at the amount of service fees
                received less the amount previously recognized as revenue upon the provision of the respective
                services to customers.

           (af) Commitments and contingencies
                In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings
                and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for the
                contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
                the liability can be reasonably estimated.

2.   Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

     (af) Commitments and contingencies (Continued)
         Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which
         may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events
         occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses these contingent liabilities, which inherently involves
         judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the
         Company or unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, the Company, in consultation
         with its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims
         as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If
         the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred
         and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the
         consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
         contingency is not probable, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent
         liability, together with an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible loss, if determinable and
         material, would be disclosed.

         Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in
         which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

     (ag) Treasury shares
         The Company accounts for treasury shares using the cost method. Under this method, the cost
         incurred to purchase the shares is recorded in the treasury shares account on the consolidated
         balance sheets. At retirement of the treasury shares, the ordinary shares account is charged only
         for the aggregate par value of the shares. The excess of the acquisition cost of treasury shares over
         the aggregate par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital (up to the amount credited
         to the additional paid-in capital upon original issuance of the shares) and retained earnings. The
         treasury shares account includes 149,903,376 ordinary shares (previously 18,737,922 ordinary shares
         before the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a)) and 146,780,688 ordinary shares issued at par
         to wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company for the purpose of certain equity investment plans for
         management as of March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

     (ah) Statutory reserves
         In accordance with the relevant regulations and their articles of association, subsidiaries of the
         Company incorporated in the PRC are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profit
         determined based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations to the general reserve until
         the reserve has reached 50% of the relevant subsidiary’s registered capital. Appropriations to the
         enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the respective
         board of directors of the subsidiaries. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are
         not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. During the years
         ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, appropriations to the general reserve amounted to RMB298
         million, RMB690 million and RMB1,032 million, respectively. No appropriations to the enterprise
         expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund have been made by the Company.

      3.   Recent accounting pronouncements
           In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement
           on Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance,
           transitional guidance and other interpretive guidance between November 2018 and March 2020 within ASU
           2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and ASU 2020-03. ASU 2016-13 introduces
           new guidance for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach
           based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including
           trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and net investments in leases. The new
           guidance also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires entities to
           determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available-for-sale debt security is a credit
           loss. Further, the new guidance indicates that entities may not use the length of time a security has been
           in an unrealized loss position as a factor in concluding whether a credit loss exists. The new guidance is
           effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2021 and interim reporting periods during the year
           ending March 31, 2021. The cumulative impact of these adjustments on retained earnings as of April 1,
           2020 was not material.

           In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying
           the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment
           by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. Step two of the goodwill impairment test
           measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill
           with its carrying amount. The new guidance is effective prospectively for the Company for the year ending
           March 31, 2021 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2021. The Company does
           not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial position, results
           of operations and cash flows.

           In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework
           – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”, which eliminates, adds and
           modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of the FASB’s disclosure
           framework project. The new guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2021
           and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2021. The Company does not believe that
           the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the fair value disclosure in the consolidated
           financial statements.

           In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, “Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the
           Interaction Between Topic 808 and Topic 606”, which clarifies that elements of collaborative arrangements
           could qualify as transactions with customers in the scope of ASC 606. The amendments require the
           application of existing guidance to determine the units of account in collaborative arrangement for
           purposes of identifying transactions with customers. For transactions outside the scope of ASC 606,
           companies can apply elements of ASC 606 or other relevant guidance by analogy, or apply a reasonable
           accounting policy if there is no appropriate analogy. ASU 2018-18 is effective retrospectively for the
           Company for the year ending March 31, 2021 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March
           31, 2021. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on
           the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

3.   Recent accounting pronouncements (Continued)
     In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, “Entertainment – Films – Other Assets – Film Costs (Subtopic
     926-20) and Entertainment – Broadcasters – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350)”, which
     aligns the accounting guidance for production costs for (1) films and (2) episodic content produced for
     television series and streaming services. This new guidance also clarifies when an entity should test
     films and license agreements for program material for impairment at the film-group level, amends the
     presentation and disclosure requirements for produced or licensed content and addresses statement
     of cash flows classification for license arrangements. The new guidance is effective prospectively for
     the Company for the year ending March 31, 2021 and interim reporting periods during the year ending
     March 31, 2021. The Company believes that the adoption of this guidance will result in a change in the
     presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

     In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments
     – Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments”, which provides
     narrow-scope amendments to clarify and improve guidance within the standards on credit losses, hedging,
     and recognition and measurement of financial instruments. Apart from the amendments to ASU 2016-13
     mentioned above, the ASU also included subsequent amendments to ASU 2016-01, which the Company
     adopted in April 2018 (Note 2(t)). The guidance in relation to the amendments to ASU 2016-01 is effective
     for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2021 and interim reporting periods during the year ending
     March 31, 2021. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material
     impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting
     for Income Taxes”, which simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12
     removes certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing
     guidance to improve consistent application. The new guidance is effective for the Company for the
     year ending March 31, 2022 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2022. Early
     adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on
     the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments – Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments
     – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Clarifying
     the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues
     Task Force)”, which clarifies the interactions of the accounting for certain equity securities under ASC
     321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323, and the accounting
     for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. ASU 2020-01 could
     change how an entity accounts for (i) an equity security under the measurement alternative and (ii) a
     forward contract or purchased option to purchase securities that, upon settlement of the forward contract
     or exercise of the purchased option, would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or
     the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825 “Financial Instruments”. These amendments improve
     current U.S. GAAP by reducing diversity in practice and increasing comparability of the accounting for these
     interactions. The new guidance is effective prospectively for the Company for the year ending March 31,
     2022 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The
     Company is evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on the financial position, results
     of operations and cash flows.

      3.   Recent accounting pronouncements (Continued)
           In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects
           of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for
           applying U.S. GAAP on contract modifications and hedge accounting to contracts, hedging relationships,
           and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because
           of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. These optional expedients and exceptions provided in
           ASU 2020-04 are effective for the Company from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company
           has elected the optional expedients for certain existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash
           flow hedges, which did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash
           flows. The Company is evaluating the effects, if any, of the potential election of the optional expedients
           and exceptions provided in this guidance on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

                 resulted in a reduction of noncontrolling interests amounting to RMB1,681 million, an addition of
                 RMB400 million and a reduction of RMB466 million for the same periods, respectively. In June 2020,
                 the Company made an additional capital injection of US$250 million in Lazada. Upon the completion

           Mergers and acquisitions
           (b) Acquisition of HQG, Inc. (“Kaola”)

            Total purchase price is comprised of:
            – cash consideration                                                                                        10,025

           (i) Net assets acquired primarily included inventories of RMB1,943 million as of the date of acquisition.
           (ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets had estimated amortization periods not exceeding 13 years and a
                weighted-average amortization period of 8.5 years.
           (iii) Contingent consideration primarily includes cash consideration that is contingently payable upon the
                 satisfaction of certain non-compete provisions by the selling equity holders, and will not exceed RMB846
                 million.

           The Company expected that the acquisition will further elevate the Company’s import service and
           experience for consumers in the PRC through synergies across the Company’s digital economy.
           Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the combined
           operations of Kaola and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience
           in the import e-commerce sector in the PRC. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to
           be deductible for income tax purposes.

     (c)   Acquisition of Alibaba Pictures Group Limited (“Alibaba Pictures”)
           Alibaba Pictures, a company that is listed on the HKSE, is an Internet-driven integrated platform that
           covers content production, promotion and distribution, intellectual property licensing and integrated
           management, cinema ticketing management and data services for the entertainment industry. In
           December 2017, the Company determined that the decline in the market value against the carrying
           value of this equity method investment (Note 14) was other-than-temporary and an impairment
           charge of RMB18,116 million was recorded in share of results of equity investees in the consolidated
           income statement for the year ended March 31, 2018.

           In March 2019, the Company subscribed for newly issued ordinary shares of Alibaba Pictures for a
           cash consideration of HK$1,250 million (RMB1,069 million). Upon the completion of the transaction,
           the Company’s equity interest in Alibaba Pictures increased from approximately 49% to approximately
           51%, and Alibaba Pictures became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

                 (ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets had estimated amortization periods not exceeding 15 years and a
                      weighted-average amortization period of 11.4 years.

                 reference to the market price per share as of the acquisition date.

                 The Company expected greater integration and synergies between Alibaba Pictures and the
                 Company’s related businesses on both content production and distribution to deliver high-quality
                 entertainment experiences for consumers in the PRC. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was

     (d) Acquisitions and integration of Rajax Holding (“Ele.me”) and Koubei Holding Limited (“Koubei”)
         Ele.me
         Ele.me is a leading on-demand delivery and local services platform in the PRC, which was previously
         owned by a joint investment vehicle established by the Company and Ant Group. In April and August
         2017, the joint investment vehicle completed additional investments in newly issued preferred
         shares in Ele.me for a total investment amount of US$1,200 million (RMB8,090 million), of which the
         Company’s investment was US$864 million (RMB5,824 million). As a result, the Company’s effective
         equity interest in Ele.me increased to approximately 27% on a fully diluted basis. The investment was
         accounted for using the measurement alternative (Note 12).

         In May 2018, the joint investment vehicle completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Ele.me
         that it did not already own at a consideration of US$5,482 million (RMB34,923 million). Upon the

                Ele.me (Continued)
                A gain of RMB1,657 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
                recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
                ended March 31, 2019. The fair value of the previously held equity interests was estimated based on
                the equity value of Ele.me derived by the purchase consideration, adjusted for a discount for control
                premium.

                The Company expected that the acquisition will deepen Ele.me’s integration into the Company’s digital
                economy and advance the Company’s New Retail strategy to provide a seamless online and offline
                consumer experience in the local consumer services sector. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was
                attributable to the synergies expected from the combined operations of Ele.me and the Company, the
                assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in the local consumer services sector in the
                PRC. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

               Integration of Ele.me and Koubei
                Koubei is one of the PRC’s leading restaurant and local services guide platforms for in-store
                consumption, which was previously set up by the Company and Ant Group. The investment in Koubei
                was previously accounted for under the equity method (Note 14).

                In December 2018, the Company completed the integration of Ele.me and Koubei under a newly
                established holding company and paid a cash consideration of US$465 million (RMB3,196 million)
                in connection with the integration. Immediately prior to the integration, the Company held an
                approximately 90% equity interest in Ele.me and an approximately 38% equity interest in Koubei on
                a fully diluted basis. Upon the completion of the integration, the Company held an approximately
                72% equity interest in this new holding company (“Local Services Holdco”) which owns substantially
                all of the equity interest in Ele.me and Koubei, resulting in an effective controlling equity interest
                held by the Company in each of Ele.me and Koubei, and Koubei became a consolidated subsidiary
                of the Company. Upon the completion of the integration, the Company’s effective equity interest in
                Ele.me decreased, resulting in an increase in noncontrolling interests and additional paid-in capital
                amounting to RMB6,715 million and RMB7,515 million, respectively.

                Integration of Ele.me and Koubei (Continued)
                A gain of RMB21,990 million in relation to the revaluation of the previously held equity interests was
                recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year
                ended March 31, 2019. The fair value of the previously held equity interests as of the acquisition date
                was estimated based on the purchase price to acquire newly issued preferred shares of Local Services
                Holdco that was paid by new and existing investors in December 2018, with certain adjustments made
                to reflect other factors that may affect the fair value estimation.

                The Company expected that its commerce platform technology, know-how and infrastructure will
                deliver consumer insights and digitized operational solutions to empower local merchants on the
                Koubei platform. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected
                from the combined operations of Koubei and the Company, the assembled workforce and their
                knowledge and experience in the local consumer services sector in the PRC. The Company did not
                expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

                Subsequent to the integration, the Company acquired additional equity interest in Local Services
                Holdco for a cash consideration of US$1,905 million (RMB13,082 million) in December 2018. Other
                investors, including SoftBank, also acquired equity interests in Local Services Holdco. As a result,
                noncontrolling interests increased by RMB3,216 million.

                During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company subscribed for additional equity interest in Local
                Services Holdco for a cash consideration of US$1,350 million (RMB9,399 million). Other investors,
                including SoftBank, also acquired equity interests in Local Services Holdco. As a result, noncontrolling
                interests increased by RMB5,162 million. In May 2020, the Company subscribed for additional equity
                interest in Local Services Holdco for a cash consideration of US$450 million. Upon the completion of
                these transactions, the Company’s equity interest in Local Services Holdco was approximately 73%.

           approximately 85% equity interest in Trendyol for a cash consideration of US$728 million (RMB4,980
           million). In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered into an agreement with the

           (i) Net assets acquired primarily included cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,206 million as of the date of
               acquisition.
           (ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets had estimated amortization periods not exceeding 15 years and a
                weighted-average amortization period of 12.5 years.
           (iii) Fair value of the noncontrolling interests was estimated with reference to the purchase price per share as of
                 the acquisition date, adjusted for a discount for control premium, and includes the fair value of an option
                 granted to the founders of Trendyol to acquire additional interests in Trendyol from the Company as of the
                 date of acquisition.

           The acquisition of Trendyol underscored the Company’s commitment to international expansion.
           Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the combined
           operations of Trendyol and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and
           experience in e-commerce. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for
           income tax purposes.

           In December 2018, the Company purchased additional equity interest in Trendyol for a cash
           consideration of US$2 million (RMB16 million). The transaction resulted in a reduction of
           noncontrolling interest amounting to RMB14 million. In April 2020, the Company purchased additional
           equity interest in Trendyol for a cash consideration of US$125 million. Upon the completion of these
           transactions, the Company’s equity interest in Trendyol was approximately 86%.

                 business in the PRC. The Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income

         ended March 31, 2018. The fair value of the previously held equity interests was estimated with
         reference to the purchase price of HK$10.00 per share in the privatization.

         The Company expected Intime to support its strategy to transform conventional retail by leveraging
         its substantial consumer reach, rich data and technology. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was
         attributable to the synergies expected from the combined operations of Intime and the Company,
         the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in the retail business in the PRC. The
         Company did not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.

         In February 2018 and October 2018, the Company purchased additional ordinary shares of Intime
         from certain minority shareholders for a cash consideration of HK$6,712 million (RMB5,428 million)
         and HK$203 million (RMB180 million), respectively, which resulted in a reduction of noncontrolling
         interests amounting to RMB5,854 million and RMB162 million during the years ended March 31, 2018
         and 2019, respectively. Upon the completion of the purchase of additional ordinary shares in October
         2018, the Company’s equity interest in Intime increased to approximately 99%.

4.   Significant equity transactions, mergers and acquisitions and investments
     (Continued)

     Equity investments and others
     (j)   Investment in Meinian Onehealth Healthcare Holdings Co., Ltd. (“Meinian”)
           Meinian, a company that is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, offers health examination, health
           evaluation, health consulting, and other services. In November to December 2019, the Company,
           together with Ant Group, acquired new and existing shares of Meinian, representing an approximately
           14% equity interest in Meinian for a total cash consideration of RMB6,700 million. Yunfeng, which
           is comprised of certain investment funds the general partner of which the Company’s director and
           former executive chairman has equity interests in, is also an investor in this transaction.

           The investment in Meinian is accounted for under the equity method (Note 14) because the Company
           is able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of Meinian. Out of the
           total cash consideration, RMB2,573 million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets, RMB4,579
           million was allocated to goodwill, RMB643 million was allocated to deferred tax liabilities and RMB191
           million was allocated to net assets acquired.

     (k)   Investment in AliExpress Russia Holding Pte. Ltd. (“AliExpress Russia Joint Venture”)
           AliExpress Russia Joint Venture is a joint venture set up by the Company, Mail.ru Group Limited
           (“Mail.ru Group”, a leading Internet company in Russia), Public Joint Stock Company MegaFon
           (“MegaFon”, a Russian mobile telecommunications operator) and Joint Stock Company “Managing
           Company of Russian Direct Investment Fund” (“RDIF”, a Russian sovereign wealth fund). In October
           2019, the Company invested approximately US$100 million into the joint venture and contributed the
           Company’s AliExpress Russia businesses into the joint venture. The other shareholders of the joint
           venture also made cash and non-cash contributions to the joint venture pursuant to the transaction
           documents. After the completion of the transaction, the Company holds an approximately 56% equity
           interest and less-than-majority voting rights in the joint venture. In connection with the transaction,
           the Company also entered into an option agreement with another shareholder of the joint venture,
           allowing the transfer of equity interest in the joint venture between the Company and this shareholder
           in the future. As part of the transaction, the Company has also acquired a minority stake in Mail.ru
           Group.

           The contribution of the Company’s AliExpress Russia businesses into the joint venture resulted in
           the deconsolidation of these businesses, and a one-time gain of RMB10.3 billion was recognized in
           interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year ended March
           31, 2020.

           The investment in the AliExpress Russia Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method (Note
           14). Out of the total consideration, RMB2,325 million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets,
           RMB4,290 million was allocated to goodwill, RMB116 million was allocated to deferred tax liabilities
           and RMB1,630 million was allocated to net assets acquired.

     (l)   Investment in Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”)
           SAPA
           In August 2014, the Company entered into a share and asset purchase agreement (together with all
           subsequent amendments, the “SAPA”), and entered into or amended certain ancillary agreements
           including an amendment and restatement of the intellectual property license agreement with Alipay
           (the “2014 IPLA”). Pursuant to these agreements, the Company restructured its relationships with Ant
           Group and Alipay.

           In February 2018, the Company amended both the SAPA and the Alipay commercial agreement,
           and agreed with Ant Group and certain other parties on forms of certain ancillary agreements. In
           September 2019, the Company further amended the SAPA and entered into a cross license agreement
           and certain ancillary agreements and amendments, including the previously agreed form of
           amendment and restatement of the 2014 IPLA (“the Amended IPLA”).

           Equity investments and others (Continued)
           (l)   Investment in Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”) (Continued)

                 SAPA (Continued)
                 Apart from the amended provisions described below, the key terms of the agreements with Ant Group
                 and Alipay from the 2014 restructuring remain substantially unchanged.

                 Issuance of equity interest
                 In September 2019, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions, the Company received the 33%
                 equity interest in Ant Group pursuant to the SAPA.

                 Under the SAPA, the consideration to acquire the newly issued 33% equity interest in Ant Group was
                 fully funded by concurrent payments from Ant Group to the Company in consideration for certain
                 intellectual property rights and assets that the Company transferred to Ant Group upon the issuance
                 of the equity interest. Such consideration was determined based on the fair values of the underlying
                 assets exchanged in the transaction as described above at contract inception in 2014, whereby the
                 fair value of the intellectual property rights and assets approximated the fair value of the equity
                 interest at the time.

                 The Company accounts for its equity interest in Ant Group under the equity method (Note 14). Upon
                 the receipt of the equity interest in September 2019, this investment was initially measured at cost,
                 with an upward adjustment determined based on the fair value of the Company’s share of Ant Group’s
                 net assets as of the completion date of the transaction.

                 Upon the completion, the Company recorded the 33% equity interest in Ant Group with a carrying
                 value amounting to RMB90.7 billion in investment in equity investees, other cost reimbursement of
                 RMB0.6 billion from Ant Group to the Company pursuant to the SAPA and the deferred tax effect of
                 RMB19.7 billion, with a corresponding gain of RMB71.6 billion recorded in interest and investment
                 income, net in the year ended March 31, 2020. The difference between the carrying value of the
                 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the Company’s share of the carrying value of Ant Group’s net
                 assets upon completion is a basis difference, which mainly represents the fair value adjustments
                 of amortizable intangible assets and equity investments. These adjustments amounted to RMB24.5
                 billion and RMB5.3 billion, respectively, both of which were net of their corresponding tax effects.

                 The application of accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in
                 Ant Group and the recognition of the upward adjustment require significant management judgment,
                 which included (i) determination of the contract inception date of the SAPA for the initial measurement
                 of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and (ii) determination of the accounting treatment for the
                 difference between the Company’s share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the
                 cost of investment when the former is greater than the latter.

                 In relation to the determination of the contract inception date of the SAPA, management considered
                 the relevant U.S. GAAP guidance and focused on the legal enforceability of the agreement, and
                 determined that the contract inception date was in 2014.

     (l)   Investment in Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co., Ltd. (“Ant Group”) (Continued)

           SAPA (Continued)
           Issuance of equity interest (Continued)
           In relation to the determination of the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company’s
           share of the fair value of Ant Group’s net assets acquired and the cost of investment when the former
           is greater than the latter, in the absence of specific guidance and with the diversity in practice,
           management assessed various views derived from the interpretations of relevant U.S. GAAP and
           made reference to the relevant guidance of other international accounting framework and recognized
           the difference under interest and investment income, net with a corresponding increase to the initial
           carrying value of the investment in Ant Group.

           Subsequent to the receipt of the equity interest in Ant Group, the proportionate share of results of
           Ant Group, adjusted for the effects of the basis difference as described above, is recorded in share of
           results of equity investees in the consolidated income statements on a one quarter in arrears basis.

           Pre-emptive rights
           Following the receipt of equity interest in Ant Group, the Company has pre-emptive rights to
           participate in other issuances of equity securities by Ant Group and certain of its affiliates prior to
           the time of Ant Group meeting certain minimum criteria for a qualified IPO set forth in the SAPA (a
           ‘’Qualified IPO’’). These pre-emptive rights entitle the Company to maintain the equity ownership
           percentage the Company holds in Ant Group immediately prior to any such issuances. In connection
           with the exercise of the pre-emptive rights, the Company is also entitled to receive certain payments
           from Ant Group, effectively funding the subscription for these additional equity interest, up to a value
           of US$1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, under the SAPA, in certain circumstances
           the Company is permitted to exercise pre-emptive rights through an alternative arrangement which
           will further protect the Company from dilution. The value of the pre-emptive rights was considered to
           be insignificant.

           Corporate governance provisions
           Under the SAPA, in addition to an independent director, the Company has the right to nominate two
           officers or employees of the Company for election to the board of Ant Group. In each case, these
           director nomination rights will continue unless required to be terminated by applicable laws and
           regulations or listing rules in connection with an Ant Group Qualified IPO process or the Company
           ceases to own a certain amount of its post-issuance equity interest in Ant Group. In September 2019,
           the Company nominated two officers of the Company who have then been elected to the board of Ant
           Group pursuant to these director nomination rights under the SAPA.

                 2014 IPLA and Amended IPLA
                 2014 IPLA
                 Under the 2014 IPLA, the Company received, in addition to a software technology service fee, royalty
                 streams related to Alipay and other current and future businesses of Ant Group (collectively, the “Profit
                 Share Payments”). The Profit Share Payments were paid at least annually and equaled the sum of
                 an expense reimbursement plus 37.5% of the consolidated pre-tax income of Ant Group, subject to
                 certain adjustments. The expense reimbursement represented the reimbursement for the costs and
                 expenses incurred by the Company in the provision of software technology services. The Company
                 accounted for the Profit Share Payments in the periods when the services were provided, where the
                 payments were expected to approximate the estimated fair values of the services provided. Upon the
                 receipt of the equity interest in September 2019, the Company terminated the 2014 IPLA, and the Profit
                 Share Payments arrangement was terminated.

                 Income in connection with the Profit Share Payments, net of costs incurred by the Company, of
                 RMB3,444 million, RMB517 million and RMB3,835 million, was recorded in other income, net in the
                 consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively
                 (Notes 6 and 22).

                 Amended IPLA
                 Pursuant to the SAPA, the Company, Ant Group and Alipay entered into the Amended IPLA upon the
                 receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group in September 2019, at which time the Company also
                 transferred certain intellectual property and assets to Ant Group.

                 The Amended IPLA will terminate upon the earliest of:

                 •    the full payment of all pre-emptive rights funded payments under the SAPA;

                 •    the closing of a Qualified IPO of Ant Group or Alipay; and

                 •    the transfer to Ant Group of intellectual property the Company owns that is exclusively related to
                      the business of Ant Group.

                 city infrastructure and service provider, whose offerings include intelligent transportation operation
                 services. In June 2019, the Company acquired a 15% equity interest in China TransInfo for a cash

     The Company entered into operating lease agreements primarily for shops and malls, offices, warehouses
     and land. Certain lease agreements contain an option for the Company to renew a lease for a term of up to

     which are expensed as incurred.

           Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital
           gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands
           withholding tax is imposed. The Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to the
           Hong Kong profits tax rate at 16.5% for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company’s
           subsidiaries incorporated in other jurisdictions were subject to income tax charges calculated according to
           the tax laws enacted or substantially enacted in the countries where they operate and generate income.

           Current income tax expense primarily includes the provision for PRC Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) for
           subsidiaries operating in the PRC and withholding tax on earnings that have been declared for distribution
           by PRC subsidiaries to offshore holding companies. Substantially all of the Company’s income before
           income tax and share of results of equity investees are generated by these PRC subsidiaries. These
           subsidiaries are subject to EIT on their taxable income as reported in their respective statutory financial
           statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and regulations in the PRC.

           Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for
           domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for,
           among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology
           Enterprises. Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as Software Enterprises and thereby entitled
           to full exemption from EIT for two years beginning from their first profitable calendar year and a 50%
           reduction for the subsequent three calendar years. In addition, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise
           (“KSE”) within China’s national plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The KSE status is subject to
           review by the relevant authorities every year and the timing of the annual review and notification by the
           relevant authorities may vary from year to year. The related reduction in tax expense as a result of official
           notification confirming KSE status is accounted for upon receipt of such notification.

           The tax status of the subsidiaries of the Company with major taxable profits is described below:

           •      Alibaba (China) Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alibaba China”) and Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd. (“Taobao
                  China”), entities primarily engaged in the operations of the Company’s wholesale marketplaces and
                  Taobao Marketplace, respectively, obtained the annual review and notification relating to the renewal
                  of the KSE status for the taxation years of 2016, 2017 and 2018 in the quarters ended September 30,
                  2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, Alibaba China and Taobao China, which had qualified
                  as High and New Technology Enterprises and applied an EIT rate of 15% for the taxation years of 2016,
                  2017 and 2018, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation years of 2016, 2017 and 2018
                  in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

8.   Income tax expenses (Continued)
     •    Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tmall China”), an entity primarily engaged in the operations
          of Tmall, was recognized as a High and New Technology Enterprise and also granted the Software
          Enterprise status and was thereby entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning from
          its first profitable taxation year of 2012, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three years starting
          from the taxation year of 2014. Accordingly, Tmall China was entitled to an EIT rate of 12.5% during
          the taxation year of 2016. Tmall China obtained notification of recognition as a KSE for the taxation
          years of 2016, 2017 and 2018 in the quarters ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Accordingly,
          Tmall China, which had applied an EIT rate of 12.5%, 15% and 15% for the taxation years of 2016, 2017
          and 2018, respectively, reflected the reduction in tax rate to 10% for the taxation years of 2016, 2017
          and 2018 in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

     The total tax adjustments for Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China and certain other PRC subsidiaries
     of the Company, amounting to RMB2,295 million, RMB4,656 million and RMB4,144 million, were recorded in
     the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

     The annual review and notification relating to the renewal of the KSE status for the taxation year of 2019
     has not yet been obtained as of March 31, 2020. Accordingly, Alibaba China, Taobao China and Tmall
     China continued to apply an EIT rate of 15% for the taxation year of 2019 as High and New Technology
     Enterprises.

     Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31,
     2018, 2019 and 2020.

     Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to their
     foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with at least
     25% equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the relevant requirements
     pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R. Since the equity holders
     of the major PRC subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies and meet the
     relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R.,
     the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are anticipated
     to be distributed. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had accrued the withholding tax on substantially
     all of the distributable earnings of the PRC subsidiaries, except for those undistributed earnings that the
     Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB107.2 billion.

           Composition of deferred tax assets and liabilities

                                                                                                            As of March 31,
                                                                                                              2019                  2020

            Equity investees and others (iii)                                                               (1,957)              (23,067)

           (i) Others is primarily comprised of share-based compensation, fair value change of certain investment securities, share
               of losses of certain equity investees, as well as accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under PRC tax
               laws.
           (ii) The related deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and 2020 were provided on the assumption that substantially
                all of the distributable earnings of PRC subsidiaries will be distributed as dividends, except for those undistributed
                earnings that the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC which amounted to RMB49.7 billion, and
                RMB107.2 billion, respectively.
           (iii) This amount primarily represents deferred tax liabilities in relation to certain equity investees, which includes the
                 deferred tax effect on the gain in relation to the receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group of RMB19.7 billion (Note
                 4(l)), and investment securities.

           Valuation allowances provided on the deferred tax assets mainly related to the tax losses carried forward
           due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization. If events occur in the future that improve the certainty
           of realization, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will be made and consequently income tax
           expenses will be reduced.

           As of March 31, 2020, the accumulated tax losses of subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong S.A.R.,
           Singapore and Indonesia, subject to the agreement of the relevant tax authorities, of RMB5,840 million,
           RMB5,090 million and RMB4,742 million, respectively, are allowed to be carried forward to offset against
           future taxable profits. The carry forward of tax losses in Hong Kong S.A.R. and Singapore generally has
           no time limit, while the tax losses in Indonesia will expire, if unused, in the years ending March 31, 2021
           through 2025. The accumulated tax losses of subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC, subject to the agreement
           of the PRC tax authorities, of RMB88,805 million as of March 31, 2020 will expire, if unused, in the years
           ending March 31, 2021 through 2025.

      9.   Share-based awards
           Share-based awards such as RSUs, incentive and non-statutory options, restricted shares, dividend
           equivalents, share appreciation rights and share payments may be granted to any directors, employees
           and consultants of the Company or affiliated companies under the equity incentive plan adopted in
           2011, which govern the terms of the awards. In September 2014, the Company adopted a post-IPO equity
           incentive plan (the “2014 Plan”) which has a ten-year term. Share-based awards are only available for
           issuance under the 2014 Plan. If an award under the previous plan terminates, expires or lapses, or is
           canceled for any reason, ordinary shares subject to the award become available for the grant of a new
           award under the 2014 Plan. Starting from April 1, 2015 and on each anniversary thereof, an additional
           amount equal to the lesser of (A) 200,000,000 ordinary shares (previously 25,000,000 ordinary shares
           before the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a)), and (B) such lesser number of ordinary shares as
           determined by the board of directors will become available for the grant of a new award under the 2014
           Plan. All share-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan are subject to dilution protection should the
           capital structure of the Company be affected by a share split, reverse share split, share dividend or other
           dilutive action. The 2014 Plan has substantially similar terms as the plan adopted in 2011 except that (i)
           the 2014 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board (or a subcommittee thereof),
           or such other committee of the board to which the board has delegated power to act, or the board in the
           absence of any such committee, and (ii) certain terms are adjusted for the purposes of compliance with
           the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the regulations thereunder, as amended
           from time to time and U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder, as amended
           from time to time, among others. As of March 31, 2020, the number of shares authorized but unissued was
           265,848,704 ordinary shares.

           RSUs and share options granted are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by
           the administrator of the plans. Depending on the nature and the purpose of the grant, RSUs and share
           options generally vest 25% or 50% upon the first or second anniversary of the vesting commencement date,
           respectively, as provided in the grant agreement, and 25% every year thereafter. No outstanding RSUs or
           share options will be subject to vesting or exercisable after the expiry of a maximum of six years from the
           date of grant. Certain RSUs and share options granted to the senior management members of the Company
           are subject to a six-year vesting schedule. No outstanding RSUs or share options will be subject to vesting
           or exercisable after the expiry of a maximum of ten years from the date of grant.

           Following the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change that became effective on July 30, 2019 as
           detailed in Note 2(a), each ordinary share was subdivided into eight ordinary shares and each ADS
           represents eight ordinary shares. Pro-rata adjustments have been made to the number of ordinary shares
           underlying each RSU and share option granted, so as to give the participants the same proportion of the
           equity that they would have been entitled to prior to the Share Subdivision. Prior to July 30, 2019, one
           ordinary share was issuable upon the vesting of one outstanding RSU or the exercise of one outstanding
           share option, respectively. Subsequent to the Share Subdivision, eight ordinary shares are issuable upon
           the vesting of one outstanding RSU or the exercise of one outstanding share option, respectively. The Share
           Subdivision has no impact on the number of RSUs, the number of share options, the weighted average
           grant date fair value per RSU and the weighted average exercise price per share option as stated below.

          Awarded and unvested as of March 31, 2020                                       65,458,962                159.66
          Expected to vest as of March 31, 2020 (i)                                       53,984,254                157.66

         (i) RSUs expected to vest are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total outstanding
             RSUs.

         During the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, the RSUs held by non-employees were subject to
         re-measurement through each vesting date to determine the appropriate amount of the expense.
         Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-07 beginning on April 1, 2019, the Company no longer re-measures
         equity-classified share-based awards granted to non-employees (Note 2(k)). As of March 31, 2019
         and 2020, 1,878,835 and 2,531,102 outstanding RSUs were held by non-employees, respectively.

         As of March 31, 2020, there were RMB26,476 million of unamortized compensation costs related to
         these outstanding RSUs, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to the
         awards granted to non-employees before the adoption of ASU 2018-07 beginning on April 1, 2019.
         These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

         During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company recognized share-based
         compensation expense of RMB16,165 million, RMB22,137 million and RMB25,651 million, respectively,
         in connection with the above RSUs.

                (i) Share options expected to vest are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total
                    outstanding share options.

                During the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, the share options held by non-employees were
                subject to re-measurement through each vesting date to determine the appropriate amount of the
                expense. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-07 beginning on April 1, 2019, the Company no longer re-
                measures equity-classified share-based awards granted to non-employees (Note 2(k)). As of March
                31, 2019 and 2020, 76,550 and 56,550 outstanding share options were held by non-employees,
                respectively.

                As of March 31, 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options was RMB4,834 million.
                As of the same date, the aggregate intrinsic value of options that were vested and exercisable
                and options that were vested and expected to vest was RMB2,846 million and RMB4,785 million,
                respectively.

                During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the weighted average grant date fair value
                of share options granted was nil, nil and US$57.33, respectively, and the total grant date fair value
                of options vested during the same years was RMB452 million, RMB311 million and RMB295 million,
                respectively. During the same years, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options exercised was
                RMB1,980 million, RMB708 million and RMB1,011 million, respectively.

                Cash received from option exercises under the share option plans for the years ended March 31, 2018,
                2019 and 2020 was RMB174 million, RMB220 million and RMB960 million, respectively.

     (b) Share options relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
         No share options were granted during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019. The fair value of
         each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model by applying the
         assumptions below:

                                                                                                      Year ended March 31,
                                                                                                                          2020
          Risk-free interest rate (i)                                                                                    1.68%
          Expected dividend yield (ii)                                                                                       0%
          Expected life (years) (iii)                                                                                      4.50
          Expected volatility (iv)                                                                                       34.7%

         (i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the
             expected life of the share options in effect at the time of grant.
         (ii) Expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a
              dividend on its ordinary shares.
         (iii) Expected life of share options is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise of share options.
         (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company and the Company’s comparable
              companies in the period equal to the expected life of each grant.

         As of March 31, 2020, there were RMB285 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
         outstanding share options, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to the
         awards granted to non-employees before the adoption of ASU 2018-07 beginning on April 1, 2019.
         These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

         During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company recognized share-based
         compensation expense of RMB270 million, RMB181 million and RMB140 million, respectively, in
         connection with the above share options.

     (c) Partner Capital Investment Plan relating to ordinary shares of the Company
         Beginning in 2013, the Company offered selected members of the Alibaba Partnership rights or
         interests to acquire restricted shares of the Company. For the rights or interests offered before 2016,
         these rights or interests and the underlying restricted shares were subject to a non-compete provision,
         and each right or interest entitles the holder to purchase eight restricted shares at an aggregate price
         of US$14.50, after the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a), during a four-year period. Upon the
         exercise of the rights or interests, the underlying ordinary shares may not be transferred for a period
         of eight years from the date of subscription of the relevant rights or interests. For the rights or interests
         offered since 2016, the rights or interests and the underlying restricted shares were subject to certain
         service provisions that were not related to employment, and each right or interest entitles the holder
         to purchase eight restricted shares at an aggregate price between US$23.00 and US$26.00, after the
         Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a), over a period of ten years from the vesting commencement
         date.




                                                                                             Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report       363

           (c) Partner Capital Investment Plan relating to ordinary shares of the Company
               (Continued)
                The number of ordinary shares underlying these rights or interests is 144,000,000 shares (previously
                18,000,000 shares before the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a)). As of March 31, 2020, there
                are 16,029,648 shares underlying these rights or interests available for offering (previously 2,003,706
                shares before the Share Subdivision as detailed in Note 2(a)). The rights or interests offered before
                2016 were accounted for as noncontrolling interests of the Company as these rights or interests
                were issued by the Company’s subsidiaries and classified as equity at the subsidiary level. The rights
                or interests offered in the subsequent periods were accounted for as share options issued by the
                Company.

                As of March 31, 2020, there were RMB967 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
                rights or interests, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to the awards
                granted to non-employees before the adoption of ASU 2018-07 beginning on April 1, 2019. These
                amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.4 years. Share-based
                compensation expense of RMB435 million, RMB409 million and RMB425 million was recognized
                in connection with these rights or interests for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
                respectively.

                The fair value of each right or interest to acquire restricted shares is estimated on the subscription
                date using the Black-Scholes model by applying the assumptions below:

                                                                                           Year ended March 31,

                    expected life of the share-based awards in effect at the time of grant.
                (ii) Expected dividend yield is assumed to be nil as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a
                     dividend on its ordinary shares.
                (iii) Expected life of the rights or interests is based on management's estimate on timing of exercise of the rights or
                      interests.
                (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company’s comparable companies in the
                     period equal to expected life of each right or interest.

                                                            For the Years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020




9.   Share-based awards (Continued)

     (d) Share-based awards relating to Ant Group
         Since March 2014, Junhan, the general partner of which is a company wholly-owned by the
         Company’s director and former executive chairman and a major equity holder of Ant Group, has
         made grants of share economic rights linked to the valuation of Ant Group (the “SERs”) to certain
         employees of the Company. In addition, Ant Group has granted RSUs and share appreciation rights
         (the “SARs”) to certain employees of the Company since April 2018 and July 2019, respectively. The
         SERs will be settled by Junhan upon disposal of these awards by the holders. The RSUs and SARs
         will be settled by Ant Group upon vesting or exercise of these awards. Junhan and Ant Group have
         the right to repurchase the vested awards (or any underlying equity for the settlement of the vested
         awards) granted by them, as applicable, from the holders upon an initial public offering of Ant Group
         or the termination of the holders’ employment with the Company at a price to be determined based
         on the then fair market value of Ant Group. These awards are generally subject to a four-year vesting
         schedule as determined by the administrator of the plan. Depending on the nature and the purpose
         of the grant, these awards generally vest 25% or 50% upon the first or second anniversary of the
         vesting commencement date, respectively, as provided in the grant agreement, and 25% every year
         thereafter. Certain awards granted to the senior management members of the Company are subject
         to a six-year vesting schedule.

         For accounting purposes, these awards meet the definition of a financial derivative. The cost
         relating to these awards is recognized by the Company and the related expense is recognized over
         the requisite service period in the consolidated income statements with a corresponding credit to
         additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these awards are recorded in the
         consolidated income statements. The expenses relating to the SERs and SARs are re-measured at
         the fair value on each reporting date until their settlement dates. The expenses relating to the RSUs
         granted by Ant Group are re-measured at the fair value on each reporting date until their vesting
         dates.

         During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company recognized expenses of
         RMB2,278 million, RMB12,855 million and RMB1,261 million in respect of the share-based awards
         relating to Ant Group, respectively.

         The Company had no obligation to reimburse Junhan and Ant Group for the cost associated with the
         awards granted during all the periods presented. In June 2020, the parties entered into equity-based
         awards grant and settlement agreements pursuant to which the parties will settle with each other
         the cost associated with the awards that will be granted to each other’s employees. The payment
         amounts will depend on the relative values of the awards to be granted in the future.

      10. Earnings per share/ADS
           Following the Share Subdivision and the ADS Ratio Change as detailed in Note 2(a), each ordinary share
           was subdivided into eight ordinary shares and each ADS represents eight ordinary shares. The weighted
           average number of ordinary shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share/ADS
           for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 have been retrospectively adjusted.

           Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
           weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, adjusted for treasury shares. Basic earnings per
           ADS is derived from the basic earnings per share after the ADS Ratio Change.

           For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic
           earnings per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including share-based awards, under the
           treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities, of which the amounts are insignificant, have been
           excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted
           earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per share after the ADS Ratio Change.

    (i) Debt investments include convertible and exchangeable bonds accounted for under the fair value option, for
        which the fair value as of March 31, 2019 and 2020 were RMB2,742 million and RMB4,704 million, respectively. The
        aggregate fair value of these convertible and exchangeable bonds was higher (lower) than their aggregate unpaid
        principal balance as of March 31, 2019 and 2020 by RMB197 million and RMB(1,576) million, respectively. Unrealized
        gains (losses) recorded on these convertible and exchangeable bonds in the consolidated income statements were
        RMB44 million and RMB(1,651) million during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As of March
        31, 2019, debt investments also included investments in certain wealth management products amounting to RMB6.9
        billion. These investments were pledged to a financial institution in the PRC to secure a financing provided by this
        financial institution amounting to RMB6.9 billion to one of the Company’s founders and an equity holder in certain
        of the Company’s variable interest entities, to support his minority investment through a PRC limited partnership in
        Wasu Media Holding Co., Ltd., a company listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. As of March 31, 2020, the pledge
        on these investments has been removed and the investments have been redeemed.

    Details of the significant additions during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are set out in

    The Company elected to record a majority of equity investments in privately held companies over which
    the Company neither has control nor significant influence through investment in common stock or in-
    substance common stock using the measurement alternative (Note 2(t)). During the years ended March 31,
    2019 and 2020, upward adjustments of RMB15,474 million and RMB4,528 million were recorded in interest
    and investment income, net, in the consolidated income statements, respectively. During the same periods,
    impairments and downward adjustments of RMB10,404 million and RMB11,031 million were recorded in
    interest and investment income, net, in the consolidated income statements, respectively. The Company’s
    impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect
    on the fair value of these equity securities. As of March 31, 2019 and 2020, the amount of investments in
    privately held companies for which the Company elected to record using the measurement alternative
    amounted to RMB81,514 million and RMB80,939 million, respectively.

    During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, no realized gains or losses were recognized for the
    disposal of debt investments. During the same periods, impairment losses on debt investments of RMB6
    million, RMB546 million and RMB890 million were recorded in interest and investment income, net in the
    consolidated income statements, respectively.

    The carrying amount of debt investments approximates their fair value due to the fact that the related
    effective interest rates approximate rates currently offered by financial institutions for similar debt
    instruments of comparable maturities.

           Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
           orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability
           of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to
           measure fair value:

           Level 1             —   Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in
                                   active markets.
           Level 2             —   Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level
                                   1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted
                                   prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or
                                   other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
           Level 3             —   Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions, consistent with
                                   reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These
                                   valuations require significant judgment.


           Fair value of short-term investments and listed equity securities are based on quoted prices in active
           markets for identical assets or liabilities. Certain other financial instruments, such as interest rate swap
           contracts and certain call option agreements, are valued based on inputs derived from or corroborated
           by observable market data. Valuations of convertible and exchangeable bonds that do not have a
           quoted price are performed using valuation models such as the binomial model with unobservable
           inputs including risk-free interest rate and expected volatility. The valuation of contingent consideration
           is performed using an expected cash flow method with unobservable inputs including the probability
           to achieve the contingencies, which is assessed by the Company, in connection with the contingent
           consideration arrangements. Investments in privately held companies for which the Company elected to
           record using the measurement alternative are re-measured on a non-recurring basis, and are categorized
           within Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. The values are estimated based on valuation methods using
           the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility,
           as well as rights and obligations of the securities.

   (i) During the year ended March 31, 2019, additions under the core commerce segment and the digital media and
       entertainment segment were primarily related to the acquisitions of Koubei and Ele.me (Note 4(d)) and the
       acquisition of Alibaba Pictures (Note 4(c)), respectively.
      During the year ended March 31, 2020, additions under the core commerce segment included the acquisition of
      Kaola (Note 4(b)).
   (ii) During the year ended March 31, 2020, measurement period adjustments under the digital media and entertainment
        segment were primarily related to the adjustments to the fair value of intangible assets and certain other net assets
        acquired from the acquisition of Alibaba Pictures (Note 4(c)).

   Gross goodwill balances were RMB268,879 million and RMB281,302 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2020,
   respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were RMB3,944 million and RMB4,520 million as of March 31,
   2019 and 2020, respectively.

   In the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of
   certain reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and recorded impairment losses of RMB494
   million, nil and RMB576 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The
   impairment losses were resulted from a revision of long-term financial outlook and the change in business
   model of those reporting units. The impairment loss was determined by comparing the carrying amounts
   of goodwill associated with the reporting units with their respective implied fair values of the goodwill. The
   goodwill impairment is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information (Note 26) because the
   CODM of the Company does not consider this as part of the segment operating performance measure.

      18. Deferred revenue and customer advances
           Deferred revenue and customer advances primarily represent service fees prepaid by merchants or
           customers for which the relevant services have not been provided. The respective balances are as follows:

                                                                                           As of March 31,

                                                                                          32,262                40,363

           All service fees received in advance are initially recorded as customer advances. These amounts are
           transferred to deferred revenue upon commencement of the provision of services by the Company and
           are recognized in the consolidated income statements in the period in which the services are provided. In
           general, service fees received in advance are non-refundable after the amounts are transferred to deferred
           revenue. Substantially all of the balances of deferred revenue and customer advances are generally
           recognized as revenue within one year.

                                                                                                         2019                 2020
                                                                                                     (in millions of RMB)

            Short-term other borrowings (i)                                                              7,356                5,154

            Long-term other borrowings (iii)                                                             8,647              11,449
                                                                                                       35,427               39,660

           (i) As of March 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had short-term borrowings from banks which were repayable within
               one year or on demand and charged interest rates ranging from 2.9% to 19.0% and 0.9% to 16.5% per annum,
               respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and 2020, the weighted average interest rate of these borrowings was 4.1% and
               3.4% per annum, respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB or HK$.
           (ii) As of March 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had a five-year US$4.0 billion syndicated loan, which was entered into
                with a group of eight lead arrangers. The loan has a five-year bullet maturity and was priced at 110 basis points over
                LIBOR. Certain related floating interest payments are hedged by certain interest rate swap contracts entered into by
                the Company. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including
                acquisitions). In May 2019, the loan terms were modified such that the interest rate of the loan was reduced to 85
                basis points over LIBOR and the maturity of the loan was extended to May 2024.
           (iii) As of March 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had long-term borrowings from banks with weighted average interest
                 rates of 4.6% and 4.4% per annum, respectively. The borrowings are primarily denominated in RMB.

           Certain other bank borrowings are collateralized by a pledge of certain buildings and property
           improvements, construction in progress and land use rights in the PRC with carrying values of RMB18,314
           million and RMB18,744 million, as of March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2020, the
           Company is in compliance with all covenants in relation to bank borrowings.

           In April 2017, the Company obtained a revolving credit facility provided by certain financial institutions for
           an amount of US$5.15 billion, which has not yet been drawn down. The interest rate on any outstanding
           utilized amount under this new credit facility is calculated based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. This facility
           is reserved for general corporate and working capital purposes (including acquisitions).

           As of March 31, 2020, the borrowings will be due according to the following schedule:

                                                                                                                 Principal amounts

           The 2014 Senior Notes and the 2017 Senior Notes were issued at a discount with a total amount of US$47
           million (RMB297 million). The debt issuance costs of US$82 million (RMB517 million) were presented as

           sheets. The effective interest rates for the unsecured senior notes include the interest charged on the notes
           as well as amortization of the debt discounts and debt issuance costs.

           The 2014 Senior Notes and the 2017 Senior Notes contain covenants including, among others, limitation
           on liens, consolidation, merger and sale of the Company’s assets. As of March 31, 2020, the Company is
           in compliance with all these covenants. In addition, the 2014 Senior Notes and the 2017 Senior Notes rank
           senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated
           in right of payment to the notes and rank at least equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s
           existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (subject to any priority rights pursuant to
           applicable law).

           The proceeds from issuance of the 2014 Senior Notes were used in full to refinance a previous syndicated
           loan in the same amount. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Senior Notes were used for general
           corporate purposes.

           As of March 31, 2020, the future principal payments for the Company’s unsecured senior notes will be due

25. Risks and contingencies
   (a)   The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and considered as a foreign entity under PRC
         laws. Due to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-
         added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers,
         the Company conducts its Internet businesses and other businesses through various contractual
         arrangements with VIEs that are held by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by
         PRC citizens. The VIEs hold the licenses and approvals that are essential for their business operations
         in the PRC and the Company has entered into various agreements with the VIEs and their equity
         holders such that the Company has the right to benefit from their licenses and approvals and
         generally has control of the VIEs. In the Company’s opinion, the current ownership structure and the
         contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders as well as the operations of the VIEs
         are in substantial compliance with all existing PRC laws, rules and regulations. However, there may
         be changes and other developments in PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the Company
         gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view in the future that is contrary
         to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of the Company and its contractual
         arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found to be in violation of any existing or
         future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct its business could be impacted and
         the Company may be required to restructure its ownership structure and operations in the PRC to
         comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in deconsolidation of the VIEs.




                                                                                 Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report     387
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      For the Years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020




      25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
           (b)   The PRC market in which the Company operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks
                 and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of the Company to operate or invest in
                 online and mobile commerce or other Internet related businesses, representing the principal services
                 provided by the Company, in the PRC. The information and technology industries are highly regulated.
                 Restrictions are currently in place or are unclear regarding what specific segments of these industries
                 foreign owned enterprises, like the Company, may operate. If new or more extensive restrictions
                 were imposed on the segments in which the Company is permitted to operate, the Company could be
                 required to sell or cease to operate or invest in some or all of its current businesses in the PRC.

           (c)   The Company’s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a
                 significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely
                 convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to
                 be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People’s Bank of
                 China (the “PBOC”).

                 Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in the PRC must be processed through the
                 PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory bodies and require certain supporting documentation
                 in order to effect the remittance. If the foreign exchange control system prevents the Company from
                 obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able
                 to pay dividends in foreign currencies and the Company’s ability to fund its business activities that are
                 conducted in foreign currencies could be adversely affected.

           (d)   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit
                 risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and
                 investment securities. As of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, substantially all of the Company’s cash
                 and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash were held by major financial
                 institutions located worldwide, including mainland China and Hong Kong S.A.R. If the banking system
                 or the financial markets deteriorate or become volatile, the financial institutions and other issuers
                 of financial instruments held by the Company could become insolvent and the markets for these
                 instruments could become illiquid, in which case the Company could lose some or all of the value of
                 its investments.

           (e)   During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company offered a trade assurance
                 program on the international wholesale marketplaces at no charge to the wholesale buyers and
                 sellers. If the wholesale sellers who participate in this program do not deliver the products in their
                 stated specifications to the wholesale buyers on schedule, the Company may compensate the
                 wholesale buyers for their losses on behalf of the wholesale sellers up to a pre-determined amount
                 following a review of each particular case. In turn, the Company will seek a full reimbursement
                 from the wholesale sellers for the prepaid reimbursement amount, yet the Company is exposed
                 to a risk over the collectability of the reimbursement from the wholesale sellers. During the years
                 ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company did not incur any material losses with respect
                 to the compensation provided under this program. Given that the maximum compensation for each
                 wholesale seller is pre-determined based on their individual risk assessments by the Company
                 considering their credit profile or other relevant information, the Company determined that the
                 likelihood of material default on the payments are not probable and therefore no provisions have
                 been made in relation to this program.

           (f)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes strategic investments to increase the service
                 offerings and expand capabilities. The Company continually reviews its investments to determine
                 whether there is a decline in fair value below the carrying value. Fair value of the listed securities is
                 subject to volatility and may be materially affected by market fluctuations.

25. Risks and contingencies (Continued)
   (g)   In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
         and litigations relating to disputes relating to trademarks and other intellectual property, among
         others. As of March 31, 2019, the Company accrued a settlement provision of US$250 million (RMB1,679
         million) for the settlement of a U.S. federal class action lawsuit in exchange for a full release of all
         claims brought in the lawsuit that has been pending since January 2015. The amount has been paid
         as of March 31, 2020 (Note 19). Except for the above, there are no legal proceedings and litigations
         that have in the recent past had, or to the Company’s knowledge, are probable to have, a material
         impact on the Company’s financial positions, results of operations or cash flows. Except for the above,
         the Company did not accrue any other material loss contingencies in this respect as of March 31, 2018,
         2019 and 2020.

   (h)   The global outbreak of COVID-19 is having a significant negative impact on the global economy and
         the Company’s business and financial results. Starting in late January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic
         triggered a series of lock-downs, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions that drastically
         reduced business activities in China. This substantial decline in business activities in China negatively
         affected most of the Company’s domestic core commerce businesses, including the Company’s China
         retail marketplaces and local consumer services business, as well as other businesses that involve
         travel, transportation and offline entertainment, such as Fliggy, Alibaba Pictures (Note 4(c)), Damai
         and Amap. The Company’s key international commerce businesses also began to experience a
         negative impact in February 2020. While the growth of the Company’s domestic businesses started to
         recover in March 2020, the timing of recovery for the Company’s international commerce businesses
         remains uncertain as demand in countries outside of China remains soft. The COVID-19 pandemic
         also presented and may continue to present challenges to the Company’s business operations as
         well as the Company’s merchants, business partners and other participants in the Company’s digital
         economy, such as closure of offices and facilities, disruptions to or even suspensions of normal
         business and logistics operations, as well as restrictions on travel. It is not possible to determine
         the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business operations and financial
         results, which is highly dependent on numerous factors, including the duration and spread of the
         pandemic and any resurgence of COVID-19 in China or elsewhere, actions taken by governments,
         domestically and in international relations, the response of businesses and individuals to the
         pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on business and economic conditions in China and globally,
         consumer demand, the Company’s ability and the ability of merchants, retailers, logistics service
         providers and other participants in the Company’s digital economy to continue operations in areas
         affected by the pandemic and the Company’s efforts and expenditures to support merchants and
         partners and ensure the safety of the Company’s employees. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to
         adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

26. Segment information
   The Company presents segment information after elimination of inter-company transactions. In general,
   revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses are directly attributable, or are allocated, to each
   segment. The Company allocates costs and expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific
   segment, such as those that support infrastructure across different segments, to different segments mainly
   on the basis of usage, revenue or headcount, depending on the nature of the relevant costs and expenses.
   The Company does not allocate assets to its segments as the CODM does not evaluate the performance of
   segments using asset information.
