Presentation of Financial Information
         In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), we
prepare our consolidated financial statements on a historical cost basis, except for our short term investments, long term investments, Exchangeable Notes (as
defined herein), and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value, and our lease liabilities, which are measured at present value.


Non-IFRS Financial Measures
         In this report, we present Free Cash Flow, which is a financial measure not recognized by IFRS and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of
IFRS-compliant financial statements or notes thereto. For a discussion of Free Cash Flow and a reconciliation to its most closely comparable IFRS measures,
see “Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resource.”


Rounding
          Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included in this report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures
shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may
not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

        This report contains estimates and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.
The words “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “seek,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,”
“continue,” “contemplate,” “possible,” and similar words are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.
         Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or
may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions,
they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important factors may adversely affect
our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to:

             •             our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and services;
             •             competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers;
             •             risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth and the scope and complexity of our
                           business;
             •             risks associated with our new products or services and our emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results;
             •             our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy;
             •             our ability to generate profit or positive cash flow on a sustained basis;
             •             our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings;
             •             our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid evolving industry trends in digital advertising;
             •             our ability to generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content;
             •             potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our Service (as defined below);
             •             risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and divestitures;
             •             our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream;

D. Risk Factors
          An investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider the following risks, along with the other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F. The risks described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of these risks actually occur, our
business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flow could be materially impaired. The trading price of our ordinary shares could decline due to any of
these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are organized by risk type and are not listed in order of their priority to
us.

Summary Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business Model, Strategy, and Performance

    •    We face significant competition for users, listening time, and advertisers, and we might not be successful at attracting prospective users and retaining
         existing users, including through predicting, recommending, and playing content that our users enjoy, or effectively monetizing our products and
         services, including podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content.
    •    We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, the scope and complexity of our business, and our international operations, including attracting,
         retaining, and motivating qualified personnel and obtaining rights to stream content on favorable terms.
    •    Our new products or services may not be successful and our emphasis on long-term user engagement may not align with the market’s expectations.
    •    We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may not be able to generate profit or positive cash flow on a sustained basis. In addition,
         our revenue growth rate may decline.
    •    We may fail to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings.
    •    Evolving industry trends in digital advertising may pose challenges for our ability to forecast or optimize our advertising inventory, which may
         adversely impact our advertising revenue.
    •    We may be subject to disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our Service.
    •    Our acquisitions, investments, or divestitures could disrupt our operations and harm operating results.

Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream

    •    Any change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary third-party licenses for the content we stream, including under any license
         agreements or statutory or compulsory licenses, may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
    •    Our major content providers have the ability to unilaterally affect our access to music and other content.
    •    We are a party to complex license agreements and have a complex royalty payment schedule, which increases the difficulty of estimating the amount
         payable under our license agreements or relevant statutes.
    •    Financial commitments under certain license agreements may limit our operating flexibility.
    •    Difficulties in identifying the compositions embodied in sound recordings and the ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations
         under our licenses, affect the size of our catalog, impact our ability to control content acquisition costs, and lead to potential copyright infringement
         claims.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

    •    Assertions of infringement or other violation by us of third-party intellectual property rights, or failure to protect our own intellectual property, could
         harm our business.

Risks Related to Our Operations

    •    We have limited ability to control access to online platforms, operating systems, hardware, or networks on which we rely.
    •    We may fail to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or the security of confidential information, and our products may
         contain undetected errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or vulnerabilities.
    •    Interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our own systems or from third parties, such as Google Cloud Platform, could harm
         our business.
    •    Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations around the world, including those related to copyright, privacy and data security,
         content moderation, and use of artificial intelligence.
    •    We are subject to risks associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters.



                                                                                  5
Table of Contents



    •    We are subject to other risks related to our brand, payment acceptance, fluctuation of operating results, availability of additional capital to support
         strategic objectives, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and significant fluctuations of exchange rates.

Risks Related to Our Metrics

    •    Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement accuracy.
    •    Failure to effectively manage and remediate attempts to manipulate stream counts and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain
         features of our Service could undermine investor confidence.

Risks Related to Indebtedness

    •    Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations.
    •    We may be unable to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or pay any amounts due upon exchange for cash.
    •    Provisions in the Indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.
    •    The Exchangeable Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.

Risks Related to Tax

    •    We face complex taxation regimes in various jurisdictions. Audits, investigations, tax proceedings, and changes to tax laws in any of the jurisdictions
         we operate could have a material adverse effect on us.
    •    We may not be able to utilize all, or any, of our net operating loss carry-forwards.
    •    The social costs we accrue for share-based compensation may fluctuate significantly with the trading price of our ordinary shares.
    •    Due to the effects of our share-based compensation deductions, our effective tax rate may vary significantly.
    •    We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of
         our ordinary shares.
    •    If a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such shareholder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax
         consequences.

Risks Related to Owning Our Ordinary Shares

    •    The trading price of our ordinary shares has been and will likely continue to be volatile.
    •    Provisions in our articles of association, the issuance of beneficiary certificates, and the existence of certain voting agreements may delay or prevent
         our acquisition by a third party.
    •    We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
    •    Beneficiary certificates will limit your voting power and ability to influence our corporate governance.

Risks Related to Investment in a Luxembourg Company and Our Status as a Foreign Private Issuer

    •    Because we are a foreign private issuer, the rights of our shareholders may differ from those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation, and shareholders
         may have difficulty in obtaining or enforcing judgments or bringing original actions against us or the members of our board in the United States.
    •    Luxembourg and European insolvency and bankruptcy laws are substantially different from U.S. insolvency laws and may offer our shareholders less
         protection than U.S. insolvency and bankruptcy law.

Risks Related to Our Business Model, Strategy, and Performance

        If our efforts to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and effectively monetize our products and services are not successful, our growth
prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.

         Our ability to grow our business and generate revenue depends on retaining, expanding, and effectively monetizing our total user base, including by
increasing the number of subscribers to our premium service (“Premium Service”) and the number of users of our ad-supported service (“Ad-Supported
Service”, and together with the Premium Service, the “Service”) and finding ways to monetize our products and services. We must convince prospective users
of the benefits of our Service and our existing users of the continuing value of our Service. Our ability to attract new users, retain existing users, and engage
active users depends in large part on our ability to continue to offer exceptional technologies and products, compelling content, competitive pricing, superior
functionality, and an engaging user experience. Some of our competitors, including Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon, have developed, and are continuing to
develop, devices for which their audio streaming services are preloaded or may also be set as the default providers, which puts us at a significant competitive
disadvantage. As consumer



                                                                                 6
Table of Contents



tastes and preferences change on the internet and with mobile and other connected products, including cars, in-home, and wearable devices, we will need to
enhance and improve our existing Service, introduce new services and features, and maintain our competitive position with additional technological advances
and an adaptable platform. From time to time, we have adjusted in the past, and may adjust in the future, our subscription pricing, plans, or our pricing model,
which may not be well-received by consumers and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain users or generate revenue. If we fail to keep pace
with technological advances or fail to offer compelling product offerings and state-of-the-art delivery platforms with competitive pricing that consumers
perceive to be of value, our ability to grow or sustain the reach of our Service, attract and retain users, and monetize our products and services may be
adversely affected.

         In order to increase our advertising revenue, we seek to increase the listening time that our users spend on our Service or find new opportunities to
deliver advertising to users on the Service, such as through podcasts and other opportunities relating to content promotion to users. The more content users
stream on our Service, the more advertising inventory we generally have to sell. Further, growth in our user base increases the size and scope of user pools
targeted by advertisers, which improves our ability to deliver relevant advertising to those users in a manner that maximizes our advertising customers’ return
on investment and that ultimately allows us to better demonstrate the effectiveness of our advertising solutions and justifies a pricing structure that is
advantageous for us. If we fail to grow our user base, the amount of content streamed, and the listening time that our users spend on our Service, we may be
unable to grow our advertising revenue. Moreover, given that subscribers to our Premium Service (“Premium Subscribers”) are sourced primarily from
converting users of our Ad-Supported Service (“Ad-Supported Users”), any failure to grow our Ad-Supported User base or convert Ad-Supported Users to
Premium Subscribers may negatively impact our revenue.

         In order to retain, expand, and effectively monetize our user base, we will need to address a number of challenges, including:

    •    providing users with a consistently high-quality and user-friendly experience;
    •    continuing to curate a catalog of content that consumers want to engage with on our Service;
    •    continuing to innovate and keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors; and
    •    maintaining and building our relationships with the makers of mobile and other connected devices.

         Failure to overcome any one of these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

         We face and will continue to face significant competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers.

          We face robust and rapidly evolving competition in all aspects of our business, including from companies that allow users to share and discover
content and/or that enable advertisers to use content platforms to reach customers, such as Apple, Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Amazon, Meta
(including Facebook and Instagram), and ByteDance (including TikTok). See “Item 4.B. Business Overview—Competition” for a more detailed description of
certain services that compete with us.

          We vigorously compete to attract, engage, and retain users against current and potential competitors, both globally and in particular geographic
regions where we operate. These competitive risks are heightened because some of our competitors have more extensive hardware, software, and service
offerings, longer histories, larger user bases, increased brand recognition, more experience in the markets in which we compete, and greater overall resources
than we do. These advantages enable them to devote more financial resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing, which in turn enables
them to offer competitive services at little or no profit or even at a loss. For example, prominent, well-funded competitors like Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon
have a competitive advantage because they can leverage the substantially broader product offerings in their ecosystem to gain subscribers through bundled
offers and to monetize users. Additionally, our current and future competitors have engaged and will continue to engage in mergers or acquisitions with each
other, to combine and leverage their broad audiences, content, and capabilities.

          Relatedly, we compete for users based on our presence and visibility as compared with other businesses and platforms that deliver audio content
through the internet and connected devices. We face significant competition for users from companies promoting their own digital audio content online or
through application stores, including large, well-funded, and seasoned participants in the digital media market. Device application stores often offer users the
ability to browse applications by various criteria, such as the number of downloads in a given time period, the length of time since an application was released
or updated, or the category in which the application is placed. The websites and applications of our competitors may rank higher than our website and our
Spotify application in search engines or application stores, and/or our application may be difficult to locate in device application stores, which could draw
potential users away from our Service and toward those of our



                                                                                7
Table of Contents



competitors. For example, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon own application store platforms and charge in-application purchase fees, which may not be levied on
their own applications, creating a competitive advantage for themselves against us. If other competitors that own application store platforms and competitive
services adopt similar practices, we may be similarly impacted. In addition, some of these competitors, including Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon, have
developed, and are continuing to develop, devices for which their music and/or podcast streaming service is preloaded and/or able to be used out-of-the-box
without the need to log in, creating a visibility and access advantage. If we are unable to compete successfully for users against other digital media providers by
maintaining and increasing our presence, ease of use, and visibility, our number of Premium Subscribers, Ad-Supported Users, and the amount of content
streamed on our Service may decline or may increase less than expected, and our subscription fees and advertising sales may suffer. See “—If our efforts to
attract prospective users, retain existing users, and effectively monetize our products and services are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue will be
adversely affected.”

          We also face increasing competition because of new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. Our current and future competitors
have introduced, and may continue to introduce, new ways of consuming or engaging with content that cause our users, especially the younger demographic, to
switch to another product or service, which would negatively affect our user retention, growth, and engagement. As the market for on-demand audio on the
internet and mobile and connected devices increases, new competitors, business models, and solutions are likely to emerge. Companies with a combination of
technical expertise, brand recognition, financial resources, and digital media experience may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in market
requirements better than we can, undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or adopt more aggressive
pricing policies. As we introduce new products or services or as our products or services evolve, we may become subject to additional competition.

         Additionally, we compete for a share of advertisers’ overall marketing budgets with other content providers on a variety of factors, including perceived
return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products and content offering, pricing structure, and ability to deliver large volumes or
precise types of advertisements to targeted user demographic pools. We also compete for advertisers with a range of internet companies. Large internet
companies with strong brand recognition, such as Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon, have significant numbers of sales personnel, substantial advertising inventory,
proprietary advertising technology solutions, and traffic that provide a significant competitive advantage and have a significant impact on pricing for reaching
these user bases.

         Failure to compete successfully against our current or future competitors could result in the loss of current or potential advertisers, a reduced share of
our advertisers’ overall marketing budget, the loss of existing or potential users, or diminished brand strength, which could adversely affect our pricing and
margins, lower our revenue, increase our research and development and marketing expenses, and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability.

         We face many risks associated with our international operations.

        We have significant international operations and are continuing to grow our operations internationally. However, managing our business and offering
our products and services internationally involves numerous risks and challenges, including:

    •    difficulties in obtaining licenses on favorable terms or at all and maintaining relationships with rights holders;
    •    challenges due to fragmentation of rights ownership and lack of well-functioning copyright collective management organizations;
    •    difficulties in achieving market acceptance and growth in markets with different tastes and interests or where we commit fewer marketing resources;
    •    difficulties in effectively monetizing our growing international user base;
    •    difficulties in managing operations due to language barriers, distance, staffing, user behavior, spending capability, cultural differences, business
         infrastructure constraints, and laws regulating corporations that operate internationally;
    •    application of different laws and regulations of various jurisdictions, including privacy, telecommunications and media, cybersecurity, content
         moderation, corporate governance, labor and employment, environmental, human rights, health and safety, consumer protection, liability standards
         and regulations, as well as intellectual property laws;
    •    potential adverse tax consequences associated with foreign operations;
    •    complex foreign exchange fluctuations, credit risk, payment fraud, restrictions on international monetary flow, and associated issues;
    •    increased competition from local websites and audio content providers;
    •    political, economic, and social instability in some countries;
    •    compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export controls and economic sanctions laws imposed by
         the U.S. government, and similar laws in other jurisdictions; and
    •    reduced or ineffective protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries.



                                                                                 8
Table of Contents




         If we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations and continue to grow internationally as a result of these obstacles, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

         We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the scope and complexity of our business.

         Our rapid growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. In
order to attain and maintain profitability, we will need to continue to demonstrate our value proposition to users, advertisers, and business partners and increase
the monetization of our products and services. Continued growth and the increased scope and complexity of our business could also strain our ability to
maintain reliable service levels for our users, effectively monetize the content streamed, efficiently develop and improve our operational and financial controls,
and recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel. If our systems do not evolve to meet the increased demands placed on us by an increasing number of
advertisers, we also may be unable to meet our obligations under advertising agreements with respect to the delivery of advertising or other performance
obligations. As our operations grow in size, scope, and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, which will require
significant expenditures and allocation of valuable technical and management resources. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes
to pursue greater operating efficiencies and realign our strategic priorities. For example, in 2023, we announced several initiatives, including reductions in our
employee base, reorganization, and optimization of our office space footprint, but we cannot guarantee that they will achieve our intended results. These efforts
also subject us to risks such as disruptions to our operations, adverse effects on employee hiring, retention, and morale, and greater-than-anticipated costs. If we
fail to maintain efficiency and allocate limited resources effectively in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results, and financial condition may
suffer.

         We have experienced rapid growth rates in both the number of active users of our Service and revenue over the last few years. As we grow larger and
increase our user base and usage, we expect it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the rate of growth we currently experience.

        Our new products or services may not be successful and our emphasis on long-term user engagement could adversely affect our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

         Our industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in technology, evolving consumer needs, and the frequent introduction by our competitors of
new and enhanced offerings. We must constantly assess the playing field and determine whether we need to improve or re-allocate resources among our
existing products and services or create new ones. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products and services or develop and introduce new
products and services, including in areas where we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, in 2023, we announced the launch
of audiobooks on our Premium Service, making a specified monthly allocation of access available for eligible Premium Subscribers in the U.K., Australia, and
the U.S. We are in the early stages of exploring additional potential monetization opportunities, although we do not expect any significant revenue attributable
to those opportunities in the near-term and these opportunities may not prove successful at all. No assurance can be given that consumer demand for such new
products or services will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these offerings will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to
generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with them. It is also possible that products and services developed by others will
render our products and services noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products and services could distract
management from current operations and will divert capital and other resources from our more established products and services. If we do not realize the
expected benefits of our investments in new products or services, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be harmed.

          Our culture also focuses on long-term user engagement, which may not necessarily maximize short-term operating results or financial condition. We
frequently make decisions that may reduce our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience and will
thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our user
growth and engagement, our relationships with advertisers and partners, as well as our business, operating results, and financial condition could be seriously
harmed. These decisions may yield results that sometimes do not align with the market’s expectations, in which case our stock price may also be negatively
affected.

         If we fail to accurately predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy, we may fail to retain existing users and attract new users in
sufficient numbers to meet investor expectations for growth or to operate our business profitably.




                                                                                  9

          We believe that a key differentiating factor between Spotify and other audio content providers is our ability to predict music, podcasts, audiobooks, or
other content that our users will enjoy. Our system for predicting user preferences and selecting content tailored to our users’ individual tastes is based on
advanced data analytics systems and our proprietary algorithms. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources in refining these
technologies; however, we cannot assure you that such investments will yield an attractive return or that such refinements will be effective. The effectiveness of
our ability to predict user preferences and select content tailored to our users’ individual tastes depends in part on our ability to gather and effectively analyze
large amounts of user data. In addition, our ability to offer users content that they have not previously heard and impart a sense of discovery depends on our
ability to acquire and appropriately categorize additional content that will appeal to our users’ diverse and changing tastes. Data security and privacy laws and
regulations, and operating systems’ practices and policies may impact our ability to collect user information and provide personalized content. See “—Failure
to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.” While we have a large
catalog of music, podcasts, and audiobooks available to stream, we must continuously identify and analyze additional content that our users will enjoy and we
may not effectively do so. Our ability to predict and select content that our users enjoy is critical to the perceived value of our Service among our users and our
failure to make accurate predictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately attract and retain users or generate revenue to meet investor
expectations for growth or to operate the business profitably.

         We have incurred significant operating losses in the past, and we may not be able to generate profit or positive cash flow on a sustained basis. In
addition, our revenue growth rate may decline.

         We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and, as of December 31, 2023, had an accumulated deficit of €4,182 million. While for the
year ended December 31, 2021, we had operating income of €94 million, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our operating losses
were €446 million and €659 million, respectively. We have incurred significant costs to license content and continue to pay royalties or other consideration to
record labels, publishers, and other copyright owners for such content. If we cannot successfully earn revenue at a rate that exceeds the operational costs,
including royalty and other licensing expenses, associated with our Service, we will not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or generate positive cash flow
on a sustained basis.

         Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the growth in revenue we have experienced over the past few years will continue at the same rate or even
continue to grow at all. In the future, our revenue growth rate may decline because of a variety of factors, including market saturation, the maturation of our
business, or increased competition. You should not consider our historical revenue growth or operating expenses as indicative of our future performance. If our
revenue growth rate declines or our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance may be adversely affected.

         Additionally, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:

    •    securing top quality content from leading record labels, distributors, aggregators, and other content owners or providers, as well as any rights to works
         contained in that content;
    •    our technology infrastructure, including development tools, scalability, availability, performance, security, and disaster recovery measures;
    •    research and development, including investments in our research and development team and the development of new features, forms of content, and
         other products or services;
    •    sales and marketing, including costs related to our field sales organization and advertising globally;
    •    international operations in an effort to maintain and increase our user base, engagement, and sales; and
    •    general administration, including legal and accounting expenses.

         These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, our
business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed.

         Failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

         Our ability to attract and retain advertisers, and to maintain and increase advertising revenue, depends on a number of factors, including:

    •    increasing the number of hours our users spend listening to audio or otherwise engaging with content on our Service;
    •    increasing the number of Ad-Supported Users and the number of our users listening to podcasts;
    •    user demographics and engagement patterns that make us more or less attractive to advertisers;
    •    providing a content portfolio that sustains or increases the value of our advertisements;



                                                                                10

    •    keeping pace with changes in technology and our competitors;
    •    competing effectively for advertising dollars with other online and mobile marketing and media companies;
    •    maintaining and growing our relationships with marketers, agencies, and other demand sources who purchase advertising inventory from us;
    •    maintaining and growing our relationships with podcast publishers and other creators who provide us with sources of advertising inventory that we
         can monetize;
    •    impact from the macroeconomic environment on advertisers;
    •    implementing and maintaining an effective infrastructure for campaign and order management;
    •    convincing advertisers of the value of innovations to our current advertising offerings;
    •    managing adverse legal developments relating to advertising, including changes mandated or prompted by legislation, regulation, executive actions, or
         litigation regarding the collection, use, and sharing of personal data for advertising-related purposes; and
    •    continuing to develop and diversify our advertising platform and offerings, which currently include delivery of advertising products through multiple
         delivery channels, including traditional computers, mobile, and other connected devices, and multiple content types, including podcasts.

          We may not succeed in capturing a greater share of our advertisers’ core marketing budgets, particularly if we are unable to achieve the scale, reach,
frequency, products, and market penetration necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of our advertising solutions, or if our advertising model proves
ineffective or not competitive when compared to other alternatives and platforms through which advertisers choose to invest their budgets.

        Failure to grow our user base and to effectively demonstrate the value of our advertising offerings to advertisers could result in loss of, or reduced
spending by, existing or potential future advertisers, which would materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition,
macroeconomic conditions have affected in the past, and may affect in the future, advertisers’ spending. See “—The impact of worldwide economic conditions
may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.”

          Selling advertisements requires that we demonstrate to advertisers that our advertising offerings are effective. For example, we need to show that our
Service has substantial reach and engagement by relevant demographic audiences. Some of our demographic data may be incomplete or inaccurate. For
example, because our users self-report their personal data, including gender and date of birth, the personal data we have may differ from our users’ actual
information. If our users provide us with incorrect or incomplete information regarding their personal data, such as gender, age, or other attributes we use to
target advertisements to users, or the data are otherwise not available to us, then we may fail to target the correct demographic with our advertising. In addition,
changes to operating systems' practices and policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency (“ATT”) framework and privacy manifests, have reduced and
may continue to reduce the quantity and quality of the data and metrics that can be collected or used by us and our partners. Alphabet has announced that it will
implement similar changes with respect to its Android operating system, and major web browsers, like Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, have made or may make
similar changes in the future as well. Apple also released software development kit (“SDK”) privacy controls in September 2023, including new protections
designed to limit tracking or identification of user devices. Our users may also exercise their option not to share certain personal data for a number of reasons,
and current and future data privacy laws and regulations may further impede our ability to stream personalized content or offer targeted advertising and
promotional opportunities to users on the Service. See “—Various existing, new, and changing laws and regulations as well as self-regulation and public
concern related to privacy and data security pose the threat of lawsuits, regulatory fines, other liability and reputational harm, require us to expend significant
resources, and may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.” These limitations have affected and may continue to adversely affect our and
our advertisers' ability to effectively target advertisements and measure their performance, thereby reducing the demand or pricing for certain of our advertising
products and harming our business. The impact of these changes on the overall mobile advertising ecosystem, our business, and the developers, partners, and
advertisers in the ecosystem are evolving and their ultimate impact remains uncertain. Additionally, advertisers often rely on third parties to quantify the reach
and effectiveness of our ad products. These third-party measurement services may not reflect our true audience or the performance of our ad products, and their
underlying methodologies are subject to change at any time. In addition, the methodologies we apply to measure the metrics that we use to monitor and manage
our business may differ from the methodologies used by third-party measurement service providers, who may not integrate effectively with our Service. If such
third-party measurement providers report lower metrics than we do, there is wide variance among reported metrics, or we cannot adequately integrate with such
services that advertisers require, our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our Service could be adversely affected. See “—Our user metrics and
other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect
our reputation and our business.”




                                                                                11

        Evolving industry trends in digital advertising may pose challenges for our ability to forecast or optimize our advertising inventory, which may
adversely impact our advertising revenue.

         The digital advertising industry is introducing new ways to measure and price advertising inventory. In the absence of a uniform industry standard,
agencies, advertisers, and other third parties have adopted several different measurement methodologies and standards. Certain advertisers will measure the
effectiveness of their advertising campaigns based on our ability to serve their ads to audiences that match their demographic data benchmarks, and our ability
to meet the requirements of these third-party measurement providers may be impacted when we do not have accurate or complete user data. As these trends in
the industry continue to evolve, our advertising revenue may be adversely affected by the availability, accuracy, and utility of analytics and measurement
technologies as well as our ability to successfully implement and operationalize such technologies and standards. For example, we leverage streaming ad
insertion technology to improve our targeting and measurement capabilities for podcast advertising that rely on our streaming capabilities instead of using
downloads as a proxy. However, the impact of the shift in measurement from downloads to real impressions on our advertising revenue remains uncertain, as is
its acceptance by our advertising partners or our ability to scale this technology successfully.

         Further, the digital advertising industry increasingly uses data-driven technologies and advertising products, such as automated buying. These data-
driven advertising products and automated buying technologies allow publishers and advertisers to use data to target advertising toward specific groups of
users who are more likely to be interested in the advertising message delivered to them. These advertising products and programmatic technologies may not
integrate with our Service and if we are unable to deploy effective solutions to monetize the device usage by our user base, our ability to attract advertising
spend, and ultimately our advertising revenue, may be adversely affected. In addition, we rely on third-party advertising technology platforms to participate in
automated buying, and if these platforms cease to operate or experience instability in their business models, it also may adversely affect our ability to capture
advertising spend. The evolution of privacy laws, including the GDPR, CCPA, and the ePrivacy Directive (each as defined below), may also impact the way we
generate revenue from advertising.

        Failure to successfully monetize and generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content could adversely affect our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

         There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue from podcasts, audiobooks, or other non-music content to offset the costs of
creating or acquiring this content. Our expanded audiobook offerings may involve additional risks and challenges, including increased capital requirements,
new competitors, and the need to develop new strategic relationships. Failure to successfully monetize and generate revenues from non-music content, or to
effectively manage the numerous risks and challenges associated with delivering such content, including failure to obtain or retain rights to podcasts,
audiobooks, or other non-music content on acceptable terms, or at all, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

         In addition, we enter into multi-year commitments for original content that we produce or commission. Given the multiple-year duration and
associated fixed costs to acquire, create, and market content arising out of such commitments, if our user growth and retention do not meet our expectations,
our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content that we produce or commission will typically require more upfront cash payments
compared to other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not pay for the production of such content. To the extent our user and/or revenue growth do
not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of such content commitments. The long-term and fixed-
cost nature of certain original content commitments may also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, as well as our ability to
adjust our content offering if our users do not react favorably to the content we produce or commission. Any such event could adversely impact our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

         We may be subject to disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our Service.

         We provide various services and products that enable creators or users to make content available on our Service. For example, creators or users can
record and distribute podcasts using our podcast hosting services, such as Spotify for Podcasters, and can upload cover art and profile images. These may
subject us to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties if such creators or users do not obtain the appropriate authorizations from rights
holders. In addition to intellectual property infringement, we have faced and will continue to face other claims relating to content that is published or made
available through our products and services. These may include claims related to defamation, rights of publicity and privacy, and online safety. For example,
we are dependent on those who provide content on our Service complying with the terms and conditions of any license agreements with us, our Terms and
Conditions of Use, which prohibit providing content that infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties or is otherwise legally
actionable pursuant to privacy and/or publicity rights, and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations. However, we cannot guarantee that the creators and
users who provide content on our Service will comply with their obligations, and any failure of creators and users to do so may



                                                                                12
Table of Contents



materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, while we may avail ourselves of various legal safe harbors related to
third-party content, we cannot be certain that courts will always agree that these safe harbors apply. We also face a risk that the laws related to these safe
harbors or the removal of content could change. Changes in any such laws that shield us from liability could materially harm our business, operating results,
and financial condition. See “Risk Related to Our Operations—Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations around the world. Many
of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary
penalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.”

          Given the large volume of content that various third parties, including record labels, distributors, aggregators, podcasters, audiobook publishers,
authors, live-audio creators, and our users, make available on our platform, it is challenging for us to accurately verify the legitimacy of such content and
review or moderate such content to ensure that it is otherwise in compliance with our policies. In addition, advertisers may not wish to have their brand
associated with certain types of content and if we cannot reliably exclude their ads from certain types of content, our business relationships may also be
negatively impacted. If we fail to build and maintain an effective system to moderate the content on our platform, our users, creators, or partners may lose trust
in us, our reputation may be impaired, and our business may be adversely affected. See “Risks Related to Our Operations—Our business depends on a strong
brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand could harm our business.”

         Our acquisitions, investments, or divestitures of businesses or technologies could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and
financial condition.

         We have acquired and invested in, and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in, other companies or technologies that we believe could
complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities or content offerings, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Pursuit of
future potential acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and
pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, we may be unsuccessful in integrating our recently acquired businesses or
any additional business we may acquire in the future, and we may fail to acquire companies whose market power or technology could be important to the
future success of our business.

         We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquisition or investment due to a number of factors, including:

    •    unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition or investment, including intellectual property infringement claims and other liabilities
         for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition;
    •    incurrence of acquisition- or investment-related costs;
    •    diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;
    •    regulatory uncertainties;
    •    risks related to integrating the acquired company’s various systems and processes and ensuring compliance with applicable requirements, including
         those with respect to privacy, data security, or credit card processing;
    •    implementation or improvement of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;
    •    harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and advertisers;
    •    harm to our brand and reputation;
    •    challenges in integrating acquired employees;
    •    potential loss of key employees and/or labor disputes; and
    •    diversion of resources, including cash, that are needed in other parts of our business.

          If we acquire or invest in other companies, these acquisitions or investments may reduce our operating margins for the foreseeable future. In addition,
a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill, which must be assessed for impairment at least
annually. The market value of our investments may also fluctuate due to volatility in the share price used to measure the investment. For example, the majority
of our long-term investments relates to Tencent Music Entertainment (“TME”). The value of these securities is subject to the risks associated with TME’s
business, as well as any changes by the Chinese government in foreign investment laws or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investments in Chinese
companies. See “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Investment Risk” for additional discussion of the risk relating to our
long term investment in TME. In the future, if our acquisitions or investments do not yield expected returns, we may be required to adjust our operating results
based on this impairment assessment process. Acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt,
which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if a business we acquire or invest in fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating
results, and financial condition may suffer.

         We have also entered into, and may in the future enter into, additional, strategic alliances with certain partners that we believe will help advance the
success of our business. Such partnerships may divert management focus and resources from



                                                                                 13
Table of Contents



other aspects of our business, it may take longer than expected for them to produce the expected benefits, they may subject us to additional and unknown
licensing or regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions, and they on occasion fail to produce all of the expected benefits. The success of these
partnerships will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our products and services, or to develop new products and services, and we may not
be successful in doing so. Any adverse results related to our strategic partnerships could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

          We have divested, and may in the future divest, certain parts of our business that no longer fit with our strategic direction. These transactions may
divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, whether or not they are consummated. They may also expose us to unanticipated or
ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as a result of our indemnification obligations. If we are unable to complete divestitures or to successfully
transition divested businesses, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be negatively impacted.

Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream

        We depend upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any
necessary licenses may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

          To secure the rights to stream content, we enter into license agreements to obtain licenses from rights holders, such as record labels, aggregators,
artists, music publishers, performing rights organizations, collecting societies, podcasters, podcast networks, audiobook publishers, authors, and other
audio/video content creators, copyright owners or their agents, or obtain licenses via government-provided statutory or compulsory licenses, and pay royalties
or other consideration to such parties or their agents around the world. We cannot guarantee that our efforts to obtain all necessary licenses to stream content
will be successful, or that the licenses available to us now will continue to be available in the future at rates and on terms that are favorable or commercially
reasonable or at all. The terms of these licenses, including the royalty rates that we are required to pay pursuant to them, may change as a result of changes in
our bargaining power, the industry, laws and regulations, or for other reasons. Increases in royalty rates or changes to other terms of these licenses may
materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

          For example, if we fail to obtain licenses to stream sound recordings from major record labels; if the rates we pay for mechanical licenses that are set
by the Copyright Royalty Board increase our royalty costs; if we are unable to comply with the requirements to maintain the blanket compulsory mechanical
license in the U.S.; if we are unable to obtain blanket licenses for public performance rights on reasonable terms; if our licenses with collecting societies and
our direct licenses with music publishers outside of the U.S. do not provide full coverage for all of the musical compositions we make available to our users;
for podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content, if rights holders or content providers are unwilling to provide content on reasonable terms or do not
comply with the terms and conditions of our license agreements as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, our business, operating results, and financial
condition could be materially harmed.

         There is also no guarantee that we have all of the licenses we need to stream content, as the process of obtaining such licenses involves many rights
holders, some of whom are unknown, and myriad complex legal issues across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when and whether
particular licenses are needed. Additionally, rights holders, creators, performers, writers and their agents, or societies, unions, guilds, or legislative or regulatory
bodies have created and may continue to create or attempt to create new rights or regulations that could require us to enter into license or other agreements
with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights holders, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify. See also “—Difficulties in
obtaining accurate and comprehensive information necessary to identify the musical compositions embodied in sound recordings on our Service and the
ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations under our licenses, affect the size of our catalog, impact our ability to control content
acquisition costs, and lead to potential copyright infringement claims.”

         Even when we are able to enter into license agreements with rights holders, we cannot guarantee that such agreements will continue to be renewed
indefinitely, or at all. The lack of renewal, or termination, of one or more of our license agreements, or the renewal of a license agreement on less favorable
terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. See “Item 4.B. Business Overview—Licensing
Agreements.”

        We have no control over third-party providers of the content we stream. The concentration of control of content by our major providers means that
even one entity, or a small number of entities working together, may unilaterally affect our access to music and other content.

         We rely on various rights holders, over whom we have no control, for the content we make available on our Service. We cannot guarantee that these
parties will always choose to license to us or license to us on terms that are acceptable to us.




                                                                                  14
Table of Contents



          The music industry has a high level of concentration, which means that one or a small number of entities may, on their own, take actions that
adversely affect our business. For example, with respect to sound recordings, the music licensed to us under our agreements with Universal Music Group, Sony
Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Music and Entertainment Rights Licensing Independent Network (“Merlin”), makes up the majority of music
consumed on our Service. For the year ended December 31, 2023, this content accounted for approximately 74% of streams of audio content delivered by
record labels. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to music is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more
of these rights holders or if they choose not to license to us for any other reason. These rights holders also may attempt to take advantage of their market power
(including by leveraging their publishing affiliate) to seek onerous financial or other terms from us or otherwise impose restrictions that hinder our ability to
further innovate our service offerings. We have particular issues in markets where local content is important and such local content is held by local major labels
or even individual artists, making it difficult to obtain such local content at all or on economically favorable terms. In addition, publishers’ fractional ownership
of shares of musical compositions may enhance their leverage, as the loss of rights to a major publisher catalog would force us to take down a significant
portion of popular repertoire in the applicable territory or territories, which would significantly disadvantage us in such territory or territories. The lack of
complete metadata with respect to publisher ownership may also present challenges in taking down all the tracks that include the works of a given publisher.
Even if we are able to secure rights to sound recordings from record labels and other copyright owners, artists and/or artist groups may object and may exert
public or private pressure on those record labels or copyright owners or other third parties to discontinue licensing rights to us, hold back content from us, or
increase royalty rates. As a result, our ability to continue to license rights to sound recordings is subject to convincing a broad range of stakeholders of the
value and quality of our Service. To the extent that we are unable to license a large amount of content or the content of certain popular artists, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.

        We are a party to many license agreements that are complex and impose numerous obligations upon us that may make it difficult to operate our
business, and a breach of such agreements could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

         Many of our license agreements are complex and impose numerous obligations on us, including obligations to, among other things:

    •    meet certain user and other targets in order to secure certain licenses and royalty rates;
    •    calculate and make payments based on complex royalty structures, which requires tracking usage of content on our Service that may have inaccurate
         or incomplete metadata necessary for such calculation;
    •    provide periodic reports on the exploitation of the content;
    •    represent that we will obtain all necessary publishing licenses and consents and pay all associated fees, royalties, and other amounts due for the
         licensing of musical compositions;
    •    provide advertising inventory at discounted rates or on other favorable terms;
    •    comply with certain service offering restrictions;
    •    comply with certain marketing and advertising restrictions; and comply with certain security and technical specifications.

          Many of our license agreements grant the licensor the right to audit our compliance with the terms and conditions of such agreements. Some of our
license agreements also include anti-steering, non-discrimination, and so-called “most favored nations” provisions, which require certain material terms to be
no less favorable than those provided in our agreements with any other similarly situated licensor. If triggered, these provisions could cause our payments or
other obligations under those agreements to escalate. Additionally, some of our license agreements require consent to undertake certain business initiatives and,
without such consent, our ability to undertake or continue operating new business initiatives may be limited. This could hurt our competitive position.

         If we materially breach any obligations set forth in any of our license agreements, or if we use content in ways that are found to exceed the scope of
such agreements, we could be subject to legal or injunctive remedies (including monetary liability), and/or rights holders could impede our business by
withholding content, discounts and bundle approvals, and the rights to launch new service offerings, and could ultimately terminate our rights under such
license agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We have entered into
settlement agreements requiring us to make substantial payments in the past, and may do so in the future, as a result of claims that we are in breach of certain
provisions in, or have exceeded the scope of, our license agreements.

         Our royalty payment scheme is complex, and it is difficult to estimate the amount payable under our license agreements or relevant statutes.

          Under our license agreements and relevant statutes, we must pay all required royalties to record labels, music publishers, and other copyright owners
in order to stream content. The determination of the amount and timing of such payments is complex and subject to a number of variables, including the type of
content streamed, the country in which it is



                                                                                 15
Table of Contents



streamed, the product tier such content is streamed on, revenue generated per product tier, the identity of the license holder to whom royalties are owed, the
current size of our user base, our current ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, the applicability of any most favored nations provisions, and
any applicable advertising fees and discounts, among other variables. Additionally, we have certain arrangements whereby royalty costs are paid in advance or
are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. An accrual is estimated when actual royalty costs to be incurred during a contractual period are expected to fall
short of the minimum guaranteed amount. Moreover, for minimum guarantee arrangements for which we cannot reliably predict the underlying expense, we
will expense the minimum guarantee on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. We also have license agreements that include so-called “most
favored nations” provisions, which, if triggered, could cause our royalty payments under those agreements to escalate. An accrual and expense is recognized
when it is probable that we will make additional royalty payments under these terms.

         We cannot assure you that the internal controls and systems we use to determine royalties payable will always be effective. If we fail to implement and
maintain effective controls relating to rights holder liabilities, we may underpay/under-accrue or overpay/over-accrue the royalty amounts payable to record
labels, music publishers, and other copyright owners. Underpayment could result in (i) litigation or other disputes with record labels, music publishers, and
other copyright owners, (ii) the unexpected payment of additional royalties in material amounts, and (iii) damage to our business relationships with record
labels, music publishers, other copyright owners, and artists and/or artist groups. If we overpay royalties, we may be unable to reclaim such overpayments, and
our profits will suffer. Failure to accurately pay our royalties may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

        From time to time, we accrue royalties based on management estimates of the rates that will apply while we negotiate license agreement renewals.
Changes to these estimates could either benefit or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

        Financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements may limit our operating flexibility and may adversely affect our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

          Certain of our license agreements contain minimum guarantees or require other financial commitments. As of December 31, 2023, we have estimated
future financial commitments of €4.7 billion under license agreements for the use of licensed content. Such financial commitments related to our content
acquisition costs are not always tied to our revenue and/or user growth forecasts (e.g., number of users, active users, Premium Subscribers) or the number of
sound recordings and musical compositions, podcasts, or audiobooks used on our Service. Some of our content costs are related to the amount of content
consumed by our users. We may also be subject to financial commitments to rights holders with respect to certain strategic partnerships we enter into that on
occasion do not produce all of the expected benefits. Accordingly, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability and operating leverage on our Service in part
depends on our ability to increase our revenue through increased subscription and advertising sales on terms that maintain an adequate gross margin. The
duration of our license agreements that contain minimum guarantees is frequently between one and three years, but our Premium Subscribers may cancel their
subscriptions at any time. If our forecasts of Premium Subscriber acquisition or retention do not meet our expectations or the number of our Premium
Subscribers or advertising sales decline significantly during the term of our license agreements, our margins may be materially and adversely affected. To the
extent our subscription revenue growth or advertising sales do not meet our expectations, our business, operating results, and financial condition could also be
adversely affected as a result of such financial commitments. In addition, the fixed cost nature of these financial commitments may limit our flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate.

          We rely on estimates of the market share of streaming content owned by each content provider, projected consumption by our users, as well as our
own user growth and, in certain situations, projected advertising revenue, to forecast whether such financial commitments could be recouped against our actual
content acquisition costs incurred over the duration of the license agreement. To the extent that these revenue and/or market share estimates underperform
relative to our expectations, leading to content acquisition costs that do not exceed such financial commitments, our margins may be materially and adversely
affected.

          Difficulties in obtaining accurate and comprehensive information necessary to identify the musical compositions embodied in sound recordings on
our Service and the ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations under our licenses, affect the size of our catalog, impact our
ability to control content acquisition costs, and lead to potential copyright infringement claims.

          Comprehensive and accurate ownership information for the musical compositions embodied in sound recordings is sometimes unavailable to us or
difficult or, in some cases, impossible for us to obtain, including where the owners or administrators of such rights have failed to accurately identify their
interest in a musical composition. We currently rely on licensors and other third parties to determine this information. If the information provided to us does not
comprehensively or accurately identify the ownership of musical compositions, or if we are unable to determine which musical compositions correspond to
specific sound recordings, it may be difficult or impossible to identify the appropriate rights holders from whom



                                                                                16

to obtain licenses or to whom to pay royalties. This may make it difficult to comply with certain obligations of any agreements with relevant rights holders.
This may also make it difficult to identify content for removal from the Service if we lose the rights to such musical compositions.

           In the United States, we also relied on the assistance of third parties to issue notices of intent to obtain a compulsory license under Section 115 of the
Copyright Act to those copyright owners with whom we did not have a direct license agreement. Following the enactment of the Music Modernization Act
(“MMA”), for the period between October 2018 and December 31, 2020, to the extent we did not have a direct license and could not locate the owner of a
composition, the law provides a limitation of liability under which our only liability for the reproduction and/or distribution of such compositions is the royalty
rate set by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board. That limitation of liability is contingent upon following various procedural steps outlined in the MMA and there
is a risk that we can be found to not have properly followed those steps (which could expose us to the risk of increased financial liability in litigations).
Beginning on January 1, 2021, the MMA provides a blanket license to reproduce and/or distribute musical compositions on our service. See “—We depend
upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may
materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.”

         These challenges, and others concerning the licensing of musical compositions embodied in sound recordings on our Service, may subject us to
significant liability for copyright infringement, breach of contract, or other claims. See “Item 8.A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—
Legal or Arbitration Proceedings.”

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

        Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

          Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their copyrights, patents, and
other intellectual property rights. See “Item 8.A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Legal or Arbitration Proceedings.”

         Our Service is dependent upon our ability to license intellectual property rights to audio content, including sound recordings, any musical
compositions embodied therein, podcasts, and audiobooks, as well as visual and related content, such as music videos, clips, album cover art, artist images, and
any other media assets that content providers can add or provide with their content. Various laws and regulations govern the copyright and other intellectual
property rights associated with audio and visual content, including sound recordings, musical compositions, and video content streaming. Although we expend
significant resources to seek to comply with statutory, regulatory, and judicial frameworks by, for example, entering into license agreements, we cannot assure
you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights, or that we will not do so in the future.

         In addition, music, internet, technology, and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement,
misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether
they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on
the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay significant damages; cease exploiting copyrighted content that
we have previously had the ability to exploit; cease using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend
additional development resources to redesign our solutions; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use
necessary technologies, content, or materials; indemnify our partners and other third parties; and/or take other actions that may have material effects on our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

         Moreover, we rely on multiple software programmers to design and create our proprietary technologies, and we regularly contribute software source
code under “open source” licenses and have made technology we developed available under open source licenses. We cannot assure you that our efforts to
prevent the incorporation of licenses that would require us to disclose code and/or innovations in our products will always be successful, as we do not exercise
complete control over the development efforts of our programmers, and we cannot be certain that our programmers have not used software that is subject to
such licenses or that they will not do so in the future. In the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to licenses that
require us to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our
technologies, we may be forced to do so, each of which could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

         Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.



                                                                                 17
Table of Contents




         The success of our business depends on our ability to protect and enforce the intellectual property rights underlying our products and services. We
attempt to protect our intellectual property under patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright law through a combination of intellectual property registration,
employee or third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements, other contractual restrictions, technological measures, and other methods. These measures
may only offer limited protection and are constantly evolving to meet the expanding needs of our business. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual
property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our product and brand features, make unauthorized use of original content we make
available on our platform, or obtain and use our trade secrets and other confidential information. Moreover, policing our intellectual property rights is difficult
and time-consuming. We cannot assure you that we would have adequate resources to protect and police our intellectual property rights, and we cannot assure
you that the steps we take to do so will always be effective.

         We have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications on certain embodiments of our innovations. It is possible, however, that these innovations
may not ultimately result in a patent grant, or the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient, or an issued patent may be deemed invalid or
unenforceable. In addition, given the cost, effort, risks, and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the
invention to the public, we may choose to not seek patent protection and may choose to keep some innovations as trade secrets to Spotify. We cannot guarantee
that any of our present or future patents or other intellectual property rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or abandoned.

          We also cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal
protection may be weak. We could lose both the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against, or to license our technology to, others and the ability to
collect royalties or other payments. Certain countries’ legal systems do not provide the same level of support for the enforcement or protection of intellectual
property rights as those of the United States, and as a result, our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be subject to theft without, or with little, legal
recourse.

Risks Related to Our Operations

         Streaming depends on effectively working with operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards we do not
control. Changes in our products or services or those operating systems, hardware, networks, regulations, or standards, and our limitations on our ability
to access those platforms, operating systems, hardware, or networks may seriously harm our business.

          We rely on a variety of operating systems, online platforms, hardware, and networks to reach our users. These platforms range from desktop and
mobile operating systems and application stores to wearables and intelligent voice assistants. The owners or operators of these platforms may not share our
interests and may restrict our access to them or place conditions on access that would materially affect our ability to access those platforms. In particular, where
the owner of a platform is also our direct competitor, the platform may attempt to use this position to affect our access to users and ability to compete. For
example, an online platform might arbitrarily remove our products or services from its platform, deprive us of access to business critical data, or engage in
other harmful practices. Online platforms also may unilaterally impose certain requirements that negatively affect our ability to convert users to the Premium
Service, such as conditions that limit our freedom to communicate promotions and offers to our users. Similarly, online platforms may force us to use the
platform’s payment processing systems that may be inferior to, and more costly than, other payment processing services available in the market. Online
platforms frequently change the rules and requirements for services like ours to access the platform, and such changes may adversely affect the success or
desirability of our service. To maintain certain elements of the service on a platform, we may need to make additional concessions to the platform operator that
may adversely affect other aspects of the business or require us to invest significant expenses. Online platforms may limit our access to information about
users, limiting our ability to convert and retain them. Online platforms also may deny access to application programming interfaces or documentation, limiting
functionality of our products or services on the platform. In addition, if online platforms discontinue any log-in authentication services that our users use to
access our products or services, we may lose and be unable to recover users previously using this function.

         In March 2019, we filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission for engaging in certain behaviors that we believe are unlawful and
anti-competitive. In June 2020, the European Commission opened a formal investigation into Apple’s conduct, and in April 2021, the European Commission
issued a statement of objections to Apple with a preliminary view that its App Store rules disadvantaged competing music streaming services and distorted
competition in the music streaming market by abusing its dominant position. In February 2023, the European Commission issued a revised statement of
objections clarifying its concerns over App Store rules for music streaming providers. We cannot assure you that the outcome of the process with the European
Commission will be successfully resolved in our favor. In September 2020, we joined other app developer companies and organizations to form the Coalition
for App Fairness with the goal of promoting app store



                                                                                  18
Table of Contents



principles that, among other things, address anti-competitive practices by platforms. We cannot assure you that those efforts will result in favorable outcomes.

          Furthermore, devices providing access to our products and services are manufactured by a wide array of companies and we cannot guarantee that
these devices perform reliably. Any faulty connection between these devices and our products and services may result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us,
which could damage our brand. In addition, we have no control over the hardware or software of these devices and any changes to them may negatively impact
our business. For example, changes to operating systems’ practices and policies have reduced and may continue to reduce the quantity and quality of the data
and metrics that can be collected or used by us and our partners. These limitations have affected and may continue to adversely affect our and our advertisers’
ability to effectively target advertisements and measure their performance, thereby reducing the demand or pricing for certain of our advertising products and
harming our business. See “—Failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings could harm our business, operating results, and
financial condition.”

          Moreover, our Service requires high-bandwidth data capabilities. If the costs of data usage increase or access to data networks is limited, our business
may be seriously harmed. Additionally, to deliver high-quality audio, video, and other content over networks, our Service must work well with a range of
technologies, systems, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the
growth, popularity, or use of the internet, including laws governing internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our Service and increase our cost of doing
business. For example, in January 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) issued an order that repealed prior “open internet rules,” which
included bright-line provisions prohibiting internet service providers from blocking lawful internet content, throttling such content, or engaging in paid
prioritization, as well as a general conduct standard barring such providers from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging online content providers’
access to end users and end users’ access to online content, and directing providers to rely instead on disclosure obligations backed by Federal Trade
Commission enforcement. Several states have imposed their own open internet protections modeled on the repealed bright-line provisions, although internet
service providers have filed lawsuits challenging such measures, and additional challenges are likely. In July 2021, U.S. President Biden issued an executive
order encouraging the FCC to restore the open internet rules and in October 2023 the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to begin a new proceeding
on doing so. Similarly, the European Union (the “EU”) currently requires equal access to internet content, but as part of the EU’s Digital Single Market
initiative and the implementation of the European Electronic Communications Code at the national level, EU Member States may impose network security and
disability access obligations on “over-the-top” services such as those provided by us. If the FCC does not reinstate open internet rules beyond disclosure
requirements and state laws fail to provide comparable protections, or if the EU modifies its own open internet rules, broadband service providers may be able
to limit our users’ ability to access our Service or make it a less attractive alternative to our competitors’ applications, and our business, operating results, and
financial condition would be seriously harmed.

         We may not successfully cultivate relationships with key industry participants or comply with the requirements of various operating systems, online
platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards on which our products and services depend, and failure to do so could result in serious harm to our
business and user retention, growth, and engagement.

           Failure to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or the security of confidential information could result in civil
liability, statutory fines, regulatory enforcement, and the loss of confidence in us by our users, advertisers, content providers, and other business partners,
all of which could harm our business.

          Techniques used to disrupt operations and gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate
or prevent unauthorized access to our technology infrastructure and systems or to confidential information, including but not limited to proprietary business
information and data about our users, business partners, and employees, such as payment card or other personal data. Our products, services, networks, and
operations are supported by our own technology and systems and those of third parties, all of which are vulnerable to software bugs, misconfigurations,
hacking, malicious code (such as malware, viruses, internet worms, and ransomware), employee theft, malfeasance, break-ins, misuse or error, phishing,
password spraying, credential stuffing attacks, denial-of-service or other attacks, and similar disruptions. These risks can cause operational disruptions and/or
result in unauthorized access to, corruption, or loss of confidential information such as personal data and intellectual property. We face risks from a range of
threat actors that threaten our and our third-party providers’ technology, systems, and confidential information. Third parties have attempted in the past and are
expected in the future to attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or organizations providing access to systems into disclosing sensitive information or
otherwise compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our technology infrastructure and systems or confidential information, networks, and/or
physical facilities. Security issues have arisen in the past, and are expected to arise in the future, in cases where our personnel, agents, or processors fail to
follow our policies or otherwise act inappropriately.

          We and certain of our third-party providers have experienced cyberattacks and security incidents in the past due to, for example, computer malware,
viruses, computer hacking, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks. Because of our prominence,



                                                                                 19
Table of Contents



we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and we expect to experience cyberattacks and security incidents in the future.
Cyberattacks and incidents are expected to accelerate in both frequency and impact as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques
that circumvent security controls (for example, by leveraging artificial intelligence), evade detection, and even remove forensic evidence, which means that we
may be unable to detect, investigate, contain, or recover from future attacks or incidents in a timely or effective manner. Moreover, our Work from Anywhere
program may impact our ability to protect against cyber incidents as our workforce connects from a mix of physical office space and home options, which
presents additional opportunities for threat actors to engage in social engineering and to exploit vulnerabilities in non-corporate networks. We cannot assure
you that the systems and processes that we have designed (or that third parties have designed) to protect our data and our users’ data, to prevent data loss, to
disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, will provide absolute security, and we may incur
significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks.

          Any actual or perceived breach of security or disruptive attack in relation to our systems or a third party’s systems could expose us to actions by
governmental entities (in particular given regulators' increased focus on companies' cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks), data protection authorities,
consumers, or others that could result in enforcement, litigation (including class actions), and financial losses, and the public perception of our security
measures could be diminished and our reputation harmed, all of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain users, which in turn would harm
our efforts to attract and retain advertisers, content providers, and other business partners. We would also have to expend significant resources to mitigate the
breach or attack and upgrade our security systems, and potentially notify affected users and relevant data protection and regulatory authorities. In addition, any
losses, costs, or liabilities may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any or all of our applicable insurance policies. A significant data breach
or cybersecurity-related disruption experienced by service providers that are critical to our operations and/or are acting as our data processors (i.e., processing
personal data on our behalf) would raise similar risks and obligations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, and financial condition and could cause our stock price to drop significantly.

        Our products and services are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or vulnerabilities, which could
manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business.

          Our products and services are developed, delivered, and maintained through complex technology and third-party SaaS solutions that include various
software and hardware. By their very nature, software, hardware, and SaaS solutions contain and are susceptible to unintentional and/or undetected errors,
misconfigurations, bugs, and other vulnerabilities, including so-called “zero-day” vulnerabilities. These errors, misconfigurations, bugs, and vulnerabilities
manifest in any number of ways, including through diminished performance, security incidents, malfunctions, service disruptions, or even permanently
disabled products or services. We have a practice of rapidly updating our products and services, and as a result some errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or
vulnerabilities in our products may be discovered only after a product or service has been used, and may in some cases be detected only under certain
circumstances or after extended use. Additionally, many of our products and services are available on multiple operating systems and/or multiple devices
offered by different manufacturers, and changes or updates to such operating systems or devices may cause errors, vulnerabilities, or functionality problems in
our products, including rendering our products or services inoperable by some users. Our products and services operate in conjunction with, and we are
dependent upon, third-party products and services (such as SaaS solutions), and any error, misconfiguration, bug, or vulnerability in one of these third-party
products or services could thwart our users’ ability to access our products and services, present a security risk, and thereby subject us to liability and/or harm
our reputation. Additionally, any errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code or backend after release could damage our
reputation, drive away users, allow third parties to manipulate or exploit our software, lower revenue, impact the stability or accuracy of our user metrics or
other estimates, and expose us to claims for damages, any of which could seriously harm our business. See “Risks Related to Our Metrics—Failure to
effectively manage and remediate attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service could have an adverse impact on our
business, operating results, and financial condition.” Additionally, errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or other vulnerabilities may, either directly or if exploited by
third parties, affect our ability to make accurate royalty payments. See “Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—Our royalty payment
scheme is complex, and it is difficult to estimate the amount payable under our license agreements or relevant statutes.”

         We could also face various legal claims related to these potential issues, including but not limited to consumer class actions. Defending a lawsuit,
regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and seriously harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if our liability
insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be seriously harmed.

         Interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our own systems or from third parties could harm our business.




                                                                                 20
Table of Contents



          We have experienced, and may in the future experience, periodic service interruptions and delays involving our own systems and those of third parties
that we work with. For instance, Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is
commonly referred to as a cloud computing service. We have designed our software and computer systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and
other services provided by GCP, currently rely on GCP for the vast majority of our primary data storage (including personal data of users and audio data
licensed from rights holders) and computing, and any transition of our GCP operations to another cloud provider would incur significant time and expense.
Both our own systems and those of third parties are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters (such as earthquakes or fires, droughts,
flooding, or storms), temperature or precipitation extremes, changes in meteorological patterns, water shortages, power loss, telecommunications failures,
cyberattacks, and similar events. Global climate change could increase the intensity or frequency of certain such events. Our own systems and those of third
parties are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, the failure of physical, administrative, technical, and cyber security measures,
terrorist acts, natural disasters, human error, the financial insolvency of third parties that we work with, war or prolonged conflict, global pandemics and other
public health crises, and other unanticipated problems or events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our services and
unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and data contained in our systems or stored by third parties and delivered on our behalf.

         Any disruption in the services provided by these third parties could materially adversely impact our business reputation, customer relations, and
operating results. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third parties, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a
timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one third party to another could
subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. See also “Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual
Obligations” for a discussion of our agreement for the use of GCP, which includes minimum payments.

        Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations around the world. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change
and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise
harm our business.

         We are an international company that is registered under the laws of Luxembourg, with offices and employees around the world and our Service
available in 184 countries and territories. As a result of this organizational structure and the scope of our operations, we are subject to a variety of laws and
regulations in different countries that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, advertising and
marketing, competition, machine learning and artificial intelligence, protection of minors, consumer protection, automatic subscription renewals, credit card
processing, foreign exchange controls, and taxation. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to
country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry
in which we operate. Additionally, the introduction of new products or services, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, entry into new jurisdictions,
or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or
other government actions, may subject us to increased operating costs, delays or impediments in our business activities, diversion of management time and
attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. See “Item 8.A.
Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Legal or Arbitration Proceedings.”

          The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the
manner in which we currently conduct our business. For example, based on the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, EU Member States are
implementing new rules on copyright protection, including rules on fair remuneration for use of copyrighted content and obligations on online content-sharing
service providers, which could also impact our costs or the conditions for users to access licensed content. The European Commission also is considering
changes in net neutrality policy that could permit internet service providers to impose new fees on online service providers like us, in the name of sharing
network-related costs. In the United States, the protections from legal liability for content moderation decisions and third-party content posted on online
platforms that are currently available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act could change or decrease over the next few
years. This could result in increased liability for content moderation decisions and third-party content posted on our Service and higher litigation costs. Certain
jurisdictions have implemented or are contemplating implementing laws that may negatively impact our automatic renewal structure or our free or discounted
trial incentives. Additionally, a number of regulatory initiatives that have been proposed to tackle the way platforms and digital services providers operate could
generate operational and technical costs of compliance. In November 2022, the EU Digital Services Act (“DSA”) came into force, and the majority of the
DSA’s substantive provisions are taking effect between 2023 and 2024. Among other requirements, it sets forth rules on potential liability for services for
certain types of content and on transparency measures and reporting. The DSA may increase our compliance costs and require changes to our user interfaces,
processes, and operations, which may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and provide our services to



                                                                                 21
Table of Contents



users, and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition. Failure to comply with the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of
total annual worldwide turnover and recipients of services have the right to seek compensation from providers in respect of damage or loss suffered due to
infringement by the provider of obligations under the DSA. Other jurisdictions have enacted, or may seek to enact in the future, regulations that mirror the DSA
or conflict with it.

         Our use of artificial intelligence may adversely affect our business operations, reputation, or financial results.

          We use artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning in our products and services, including in consumer-facing features such as AI DJ. We also
make investments in AI and machine learning to improve our advertising, operations, and develop new products or new features for existing products. There
are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or services or be
beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability.

          As a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory
agencies, and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their intellectual property, cybersecurity, data protection, and other laws to
AI and/or are considering or have proposed general legal frameworks on AI. We may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these frameworks
given they are still rapidly evolving. Given the current unsettled nature of the legal and regulatory environment surrounding AI, our AI features and our use,
training, and implementation of AI could subject us to new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, product restrictions, social and ethical issues,
negative consumer perceptions and reputational harm, intellectual property disputes, and other issues, including issues related to cybersecurity and data
privacy. AI-related regulations may develop at different rates and inconsistently across jurisdictions, and require us to expend significant resources or cause
delays or disruptions to our offerings.

         We face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI products and technologies, some of which also compete with
us in other areas, including streaming audio. Those other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies
or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of development in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain)
patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products.

         Any of these uncertainties or risks related to AI may adversely harm our business, operations, and financial results.

         Various existing, new, and changing laws and regulations as well as self-regulation and public concern related to privacy and data security pose
the threat of lawsuits, regulatory fines, other liability and reputational harm, require us to expend significant resources, and may harm our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

         As we collect and utilize personal data about our users as they interact with our products and services, we are subject to new and existing laws and
regulations that govern our use of user data. We are likely to be required to expend significant capital to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and
regulations. Claims or allegations that we have violated laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security could result in negative publicity and a loss of
confidence in us by our users and our partners. We may be required to make significant expenditures to resolve such claims, which may include paying
monetary damages, financial settlements, and/or fines or other penalties, including by government and data protection authorities.

          We are subject to various laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal data, including the General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”), which imposes stringent operational requirements regarding, among others, data use, sharing and processing, data breach notifications,
data subject rights, and cross-border data transfers for entities collecting and/or processing personal data of EU residents and significant penalties for non-
compliance (up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher). We have been
subject to GDPR penalties in the past and may be subject to penalties in the future. Following the United Kingdom’s (“U.K.”) departure from the EU, we are
subject to U.K. data protection law, which imposes obligations and penalties similar to the GDPR. We are also subject to the evolving regulatory guidance,
judicial decisions, and legislative developments on the GDPR and the U.K. regime, including on transfers of personal data from the EU and U.K. to other
jurisdictions. We are subject to certain legislation implementing Directive 2002/58 on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “ePrivacy Directive”),
which requires entities to obtain informed and freely given consent for the placement of cookies and similar technologies on a user’s device. Recent European
court and regulator decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and similar tracking technologies. We are also subject to the California Consumer
Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which imposes additional requirements related to, among others, heightened
transparency obligations, “sale” and “share” of personal information, and new data privacy rights for California residents and carries significant enforcement
penalties for non-compliance (up to $7,500 per intentional violation and $2,500 per other violation). California consumers also have a private right of action
under the CCPA for certain data breaches and can recover civil damages of up to $750 per



                                                                                 22

incident, per consumer or actual damages, whichever is greater. Over a dozen other states have passed or are considering similar legislation, which has created
and will continue to create additional compliance obligations and risks.

         We rely on data transfer mechanisms permitted under the GDPR and U.K. regime, including the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). European
case law and regulatory guidance have imposed additional requirements when relying on the SCCs and note that the SCCs alone may not necessarily be
sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Ensuring we can continue to transfer EU personal data outside of the
European Economic Area (and U.K. personal data outside of the U.K.) in compliance with new regulatory guidance, judicial decisions, and legislative
developments may require us to expend significant resources.

         New laws in jurisdictions where we operate, amendments to, or reinterpretations of existing laws, regulatory frameworks, rules of self-regulatory
bodies, industry standards, and contractual obligations, as well as changes in our users’ expectations and demands regarding privacy and cybersecurity,
including restrictions on our ability to collect, access and harness user data, or to use or disclose user data, have and may continue to require that we expend
considerable resources to meet these requirements and may limit our ability to stream personalized content to our users, offer advertising and promotional
opportunities to users on the Service, and to operate and expand internationally.

         Actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy and cybersecurity laws has in the past and could in the future result in regulatory or governmental
investigations. It could also result in enforcement actions requiring us to change the way we use personal data, restrictions on how we use personal data,
obligations on how we protect personal data, significant regulatory fines, or litigation. In addition to statutory enforcement, a data breach has in the past and
could in the future lead to compensation claims by affected individuals (including consumer advocacy groups). It could also lead to negative publicity and a
potential loss of business as a result of customers losing trust in us. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.

         Our business depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand could harm our business.

          We have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing
the “Spotify” brand is critical to expanding our base of users and advertisers, as well as continuing to attract creators, and will depend largely on our ability to
continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products and services, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products,
services, features, content, or terms of service that our users, creators, advertisers, or partners do not like, which may negatively affect our brand. Our brand
may be impaired by a number of other factors, including a decline in the quality or quantity of the content available on our Service, product or technical
performance failures, or other reputational issues. Our brand may also be negatively affected by content on our platform that our users find objectionable, the
use of our products or services to create or disseminate content that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions, perceived or actual efforts
by governments to censor certain content on our platform, the use of our products for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends, or our failure to respond
appropriately to such uses of our products and services or to otherwise adequately address user concerns. Additionally, the actions of our developers,
advertisers, and content partners may affect our brand if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications or websites integrated with
Spotify or that make use of Spotify content or brand features. If we fail to successfully maintain a strong brand, our business could be harmed.

        If we are unable to maintain the growth of our user base, we may be required to expend greater resources than we currently spend on advertising,
marketing, and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand, which would adversely affect our operating results and
may not be effective.

         Additionally, we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, relationships with record
labels, music publishers, artists, podcasters, authors, and other creators or copyright owners, content on our Service, our privacy practices, terms of service,
service changes, service quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, employee matters, the actions of our advertisers or strategic partners,
the actions of our developers whose services are integrated with our products or services, the actions of our users, or the actions of other companies that
provide similar services to us, could materially adversely affect our reputation and brand. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size,
engagement, and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

         We are subject to risks associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters.

         Increased attention to climate change and other environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) issues, as well as societal expectations regarding
voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures, may result in increased costs (including but not limited to costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, and
contracting), impact our reputation, or otherwise affect our



                                                                                 23
Table of Contents



business performance. We have to date and may in the future continue to take certain actions, including the establishment of ESG-related goals or targets, to
address ESG issues. For example, in late 2021, we announced our intention to reach net zero emissions by the end of 2030 through a variety of ways, including
joining external coalitions and initiatives. However, such initiatives may be costly and may not have the desired effects. Achieving our goals or targets is
subject to risks and uncertainties and depends on numerous conditions, some of which are outside our control. There can be no assurances that our
commitments will be achieved in the manner we currently intend or at all, and any failure (or perceived failure) to advance or meet such commitments may
adversely impact our relationship with certain stakeholders.

          We have also shared publicly our corporate ESG initiatives. Many of our actions or statements depend on certain assumptions, methodologies, or
third-party information that we believe to be reasonable but may subsequently be determined to be erroneous, insufficient, or otherwise unaligned with
stakeholder expectations. Certain assumptions are necessarily uncertain due to the long timelines involved and the varying approaches to identifying, assessing,
addressing, and reporting on ESG matters. Our disclosures on these matters, a failure to satisfy evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and
reporting, or a failure to meet our commitments or targets on our established timeline may potentially harm our reputation and impact relationships with certain
investors and other stakeholders. In addition, various policymakers have adopted, or are considering adopting, requirements for extensive disclosures on
climate-related and/or other ESG information, which may require us to incur additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant new
internal controls on matters historically not subject to such controls, and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and board.
Simultaneously, there are efforts by some stakeholders, including litigation, to reduce companies’ efforts on certain ESG-related matters, which may require us
to incur additional costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and other stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as
well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor. Additionally, many of our business partners and suppliers may be subject to
similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us.

         We are subject to payments acceptance-related risks.

          We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange
and other transaction fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees would require us to either increase the prices we charge for our Premium
Service, which could cause us to lose Premium Subscribers and subscription revenue, or suffer an increase in our costs without a corresponding increase in the
price we charge for our Premium Service, either of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We rely on third-party service
providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In particular, we rely on two third-party service providers, Adyen
and PayPal (including Braintree), for the vast majority of our payment processing. Our business could be materially disrupted if either or both of these third-
party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we or our service providers for payment processing services have
problems with our billing software, or the billing software malfunctions, it could have a material adverse effect on our user satisfaction and could potentially be
grounds for termination with our payment processors or subject us to fines and penalties from the payment card networks. In addition, if our billing software
fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our Premium Subscribers’ payment method on a timely basis or at all, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

         We are also subject to payment card network operating rules and federal laws governing electronic funds transfers, including but not limited to the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it more difficult for us to comply. Any failure to comply with
these laws, rules, or requirements may subject us to higher transaction fees, fines, penalties, damages, and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability
to accept credit and debit card payments. Moreover, if we suffer a security breach affecting payment card information, in addition to being in breach of our
payment processing agreements, we could be subjected to fines, penalties, and assessments arising out of state and federal regulatory enforcement, liability to
consumers, and we may lose our ability to accept card payments for our services on a go-forward basis.

         Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we are in compliance with such rules or requirements, such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use
of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders, and credit and debit card
transactions. Certain payment card associations and jurisdictions have proposed or promulgated additional requirements for trial offers for subscription services
and automatic renewal or recurring subscription services, which may hinder our ability to attract or retain Premium Subscribers.

         Under current credit, debit, and payment card practices, we are liable for fraudulent activity on our transactions. We face the risk of significant losses
from this type of fraudulent activity or financial crime. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability,
diminished public perception of our security measures, and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business,
reputation, operating results, and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, credit card and



                                                                                  24
Table of Contents



debit card companies may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us. The termination of our ability to process payments on any
major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.

         We also accept payments through various payment solution providers, such as telco integrated billings and prepaid code vendors. These payment
solution providers provide services to us in exchange for a fee, which may be subject to change. Furthermore, we rely on their accurate and timely reports on
sales and redemptions. If such accurate and timely reports are not being provided, it will affect the accuracy of our reports to our licensors, and also affect the
accuracy of our financial reporting.

          We depend on highly skilled key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, our
ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.

         We depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Ek, members of our
executive team, and other key employees, such as key engineering, finance, research and development, marketing, and sales personnel. All of our employees,
including our senior management, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry
may be difficult to replace. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive team resulting from the hiring, departure, or realignment of executives.
For example, in December 2023, we announced that Paul Vogel, our Chief Financial Officer, will be leaving the Company on March 31, 2024. Such changes
may be disruptive to our business. If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key personnel, the loss of one or more of our key personnel could
harm our business.

         Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified
individuals are in high demand, particularly in the digital media industry, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We use equity awards to attract
talented employees. If the value of our ordinary shares declines significantly and remains depressed, that may prevent us from recruiting and retaining qualified
employees. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition, in 2023, we announced
and implemented reductions in our employee base. Such reductions could negatively impact our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees.

            We may require additional capital to support our strategic objectives, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

         We may require additional funds to achieve our strategic objectives or respond to business challenges. We cannot be certain that additional funds and
financing will be available on reasonable terms when needed or at all, and our ability to secure funding may be affected by macroeconomic conditions
including inflation and changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflict, tighter credit, currency fluctuations, and changes to fiscal or monetary policy. In the event
we are unable to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, our interest expense and principal repayment requirements could increase significantly, which
could harm our business. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer
significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our ordinary shares.
Any debt financing we secure in the future could also contain restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.

            If currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, the results of our operations, which are reported in Euros, could be adversely
affected.

         Our international operations expose us to the effects of fluctuations and volatility in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee
compensation, property leases, and other operating expenses in the local currency, and a portion of our international revenue is from users who pay us in
currencies other than U.S. dollars and Euros, including the Swedish krona, the Australian dollar, and the British pound. In addition, while we incur royalty
expenses primarily in U.S. dollars and Euros, the corresponding revenues are being generated in local currencies and, as such, the multiple currency
conversions are affected by currency fluctuations, which may result in losses to us. We have experienced fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro
and other currencies that impact expenses as well as revenue, and consequently have a negative impact on margin and the reported operating results. To date,
we have engaged in select hedging strategies related to foreign exchange risk stemming from our operations. These strategies include instruments such as
foreign exchange forward contracts. However, these strategies should not be expected to fully eliminate the foreign exchange rate risk that we are exposed to.

        The impact of worldwide economic conditions has in the past and may continue to adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

         We are currently operating during a period of economic uncertainty and cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of economic downturns. To the
extent general macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of inflation, changes in interest



                                                                                  25
Table of Contents



rates, and geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, remain uncertain or worsen, our business may be harmed. In particular, economic conditions
have and may continue to negatively impact advertising expenditures. As overall economic conditions reduce spending on discretionary activities, our ability to
retain current and obtain new Premium Subscribers could be hindered, which could reduce our subscription revenue and negatively impact our business.

         Inflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, operating results, and financial condition by increasing our overall cost structure,
particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted
in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, increased costs of labor, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and other
similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases, which could materially and adversely affect our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Metrics

         Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may
seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.

          We regularly review key metrics related to the operation of our business, including, but not limited to, our monthly active users (“MAUs”), Ad-
Supported MAUs (as defined below), Premium average revenue per user (“ARPU”), and Premium Subscribers, to evaluate growth trends, measure our
performance, and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third
party. In addition, we may change the way we measure and report metrics from time to time in connection with changes to our products, making comparisons
to prior periods more difficult. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of
measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our Service is used across large populations globally. For example, we believe that while there
are individuals who have multiple Spotify accounts, which we treat as multiple users for purposes of calculating our active users, there are also Spotify
accounts that are used by more than one person. Accordingly, the calculations of our active users may not reflect the actual number of people using our Service.
The methodologies used to measure our key metrics require significant judgment and design inputs as well as technical tools that are susceptible to human
error, technical errors, bugs, or other vulnerabilities, including those in hardware devices, operating systems, or other third-party products or services on which
our Service relies. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or
changes in our methodology, including improvements in our ability to identify and/or address previously undetected undesirable user behaviors. We cannot
assure you that our efforts to improve our estimates of user base and to identify and/or address undesirable user behaviors will be successful, and these efforts
could result in the removal of certain user accounts and/or a reduction in MAUs or other metrics.

       Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies, including expending resources to
implement unnecessary business measures or failing to take required actions to attract a sufficient number of users to satisfy our growth strategies.

         In addition, advertisers generally rely on third-party measurement services to calculate metrics related to our advertising business, and these third-
party measurement services may not reflect our true audience. Some of our demographic data also may be incomplete or inaccurate because users self-report
their names and dates of birth or because we receive them from other third parties. Consequently, the personal data we have may differ from our users’ actual
names and ages. If advertisers, partners, or investors do not perceive our user, geographic, or other demographic metrics to be accurate representations of our
user base, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user, geographic, or other demographic metrics, our reputation may be seriously harmed.

         Failure to effectively manage and remediate attempted stream manipulation could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

          We have in the past been, and continue to be, impacted by attempts by third parties to artificially manipulate stream counts. Such attempts may, for
example, be designed to generate revenue for content providers and/or rights holders or to influence placement of content on Spotify-created playlists or
industry charts. Attempted stream manipulation may involve creating non-bona fide user accounts or content or using compromised passwords to access
legitimate user accounts. For example, we have detected botnet operators creating non-bona fide user accounts or hackers using passwords compromised as a
result of a data breach on a non-Spotify service to access legitimate user accounts and streaming specific content repeatedly, thereby generating royalties each
time the content is streamed or increasing its visibility on our or third-party charts. We use a combination of algorithms and manual review by employees to
detect artificial streams and aim to remove such artificial streams or non-bona fide user accounts created for the above purposes and filter them out from our
metrics on an ongoing basis, as well as to require users to reset passwords that we suspect have been compromised. However, we may not be successful in
detecting, removing, and addressing all artificial streams and any related user accounts. If we fail to successfully detect, remove, and address artificial streams
and associated user accounts, it may result in the manipulation of our data, including the



                                                                                  26
Table of Contents



key performance indicators, which underlie, among other things, our contractual obligations with rights holders and advertisers (which could expose us to the
risk of litigation), as well as harm our relationships with rights holders and advertisers. In addition, once we detect and mitigate artificial streams and associated
user accounts, this may result in the removal of certain user accounts and/or a reduction in account activity, which may affect key performance indicators and
undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators. These could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating
results, and financial condition.

         Failure to effectively manage and remediate attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service could have an
adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

          We have in the past been, and continue to be, impacted by attempts by third parties to manipulate or exploit our software for the purpose of gaining or
providing unauthorized access to certain features of our Service. For example, we have detected third parties seeking to provide mobile device users a means to
suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the Ad-Supported Service on tablets and desktop computers. If we fail to
successfully detect and address such issues, it may adversely affect our contractual obligations and relationships with rights holders and advertisers (which
could expose us to the risk of litigation), and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. The discovery or development of any new method to
gain unauthorized access to certain features of our service, such as through the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and the sharing of any such method
among third parties, may increase the level of unauthorized access (and the attendant negative financial impact described above). We cannot assure you we will
be successful in finding ways to effectively address unauthorized access achieved through any such method. Additionally, Ad-Supported Users using
unauthorized versions of our application may be less likely to convert to Premium Subscribers. Moreover, once we detect and disable such unauthorized access,
this may result in the removal of certain user accounts and/or a reduction in account activity, which may affect our key performance indicators and could
undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators. These could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating
results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

        Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business,
operating results, and financial condition, and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Exchangeable Notes.

        As of December 31, 2023, we had $1,500 million principal amount of indebtedness as a result of the 0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026
(“Exchangeable Notes”) offering. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative
consequences for our shareholders and our business, operating results, and financial condition by, among other things:

    • increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;
    • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;
    • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash
        available for other purposes;
    • limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;
    • diluting the interests of our existing shareholders as a result of issuing ordinary shares upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes; and
    • placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than we are or have better access to capital.

          Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our
indebtedness, including the Exchangeable Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, future indebtedness that we may incur may contain
financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital, or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to
comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn,
result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.




                                                                                 27
Table of Contents



         We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes for cash following certain fundamental change as set forth
in the Indenture, or to pay any cash amounts due upon exchange, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes
or pay cash upon their exchange.

          Holders of the Exchangeable Notes may, subject to a limited exception under the Indenture, require us to repurchase their Exchangeable Notes
following certain fundamental change under the Indenture at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any. In addition, upon exchange, we will satisfy part or all of our exchange obligation in
cash unless we elect to settle exchanges solely in ordinary shares. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are
required to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or pay any cash amounts due upon exchange. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities, and the
agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or pay any cash amounts due upon exchange. Our
failure to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or pay any cash amounts due upon exchange when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A
default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, which may result
in that future indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the future indebtedness
and the Exchangeable Notes.

         Provisions in the Indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.

          Certain provisions in the Exchangeable Notes and the Indenture could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party who attempts to acquire us.
For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Exchangeable Notes for cash.
In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the exchange rate. In either case, and
in other cases, our obligations under the Exchangeable Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party
from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of ordinary shares may view as favorable.

         Under the applicable accounting treatment, the Exchangeable Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.

         The Exchangeable Notes have been designated at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS. Under this
treatment, the exchange feature contained in the Exchangeable Notes is reflected in the overall fair value of the Exchangeable Notes, which is marked-to-
market at the end of each reporting period. For each financial statement period while the Exchangeable Notes remain outstanding, a gain or loss will be
reported in our consolidated statement of operations to the extent the fair value changes from the end of the previous period, except that changes in fair value
due to changes in our credit risk will be presented separately in other comprehensive income. The gains and losses relating to the Exchangeable Notes may be
significant. Accordingly, this accounting treatment may subject our reported net income (loss) and our financial position to significant variability. Furthermore,
if a fundamental change occurs, we may be required in accordance with IFRS to reclassify the carrying value of the Exchangeable Notes as a current, rather
than a non-current, liability. This reclassification could be necessary even if no noteholder actually requires us to repurchase their Exchangeable Notes and
could materially reduce our reported working capital. Amendments to International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 1, which will become effective for reporting
periods starting January 1, 2024, during the term of the Exchangeable Notes, would also require us to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability if
the exchange conditions are met, even if no noteholder actually requires us to exchange their notes.

Risks Related to Tax

        We are a multinational company that faces complex taxation regimes in various jurisdictions. Audits, investigations, and tax proceedings could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

          We are subject to income and non-income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The determination of the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities
involves the interpretation of tax legislation and often the application of significant judgment to complex issues. In particular, most of the jurisdictions in which
we conduct business have detailed transfer pricing rules, which require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm’s length
pricing principles within the meaning of such rules. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in several jurisdictions, and most of these audits involve transfer
pricing matters. Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions have challenged our tax positions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits, taking into
account any new information available, in order to determine the appropriateness of the tax reserves recorded on the balance sheet. We have initiated and are in
negotiations of an Advance Pricing Agreement between Sweden and the United States governments for tax years including 2014 through 2020 covering various
transfer pricing matters. These transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that our tax positions, including
our assumptions, judgments, and estimates within, are reasonable. However, tax authorities in certain jurisdictions



                                                                                 28

may disagree with our position, including any judgements or estimates used. If any of these tax authorities were successful in challenging our positions, we
may be liable for additional income tax as well as penalties and interest related thereto in excess of any reserves established, which may have a significant
impact on our results and operations and future cash flow.

         We may not be able to utilize all, or any, of our net operating loss carry-forwards.

          We have significant net operating loss carry-forwards in Sweden and the United States. As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carry-
forwards of €90 million in Luxembourg, €1,483 million in Sweden, €44 million in the United States relating to federal taxes, €274 million in the United States
relating to state taxes, €117 million in India, and €22 million in other foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, if we are unable to earn sufficient income or
profits to utilize such carry-forwards before they expire, they will no longer be available to offset future income or profits.

         In Sweden, utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation or elimination in full or part if there
is an ownership or control change within the meaning of Chapter 40, paragraphs 10-14 of the Swedish Income Tax Act. The treatment of the issuance of the
beneficiary certificates in February 2018 is unclear under the Swedish Income Tax Act and there is a possible risk that such issuance may have constituted an
ownership or control change, as defined by the Swedish Income Tax Act. If our issuance of the beneficiary certificates were to be deemed to have constituted
an ownership or control change, our ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards may be limited or eliminated.

         In addition, in the United States, utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation if there is an
ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 382”). In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section
382, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50% of the outstanding stock of
a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions, and
we may continue to do so in the future, which, combined with current or future shareholders’ disposition of ordinary shares, may have resulted in such an
ownership change. Such an ownership change may limit the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income.

        If the fair market value of our ordinary shares fluctuates significantly on a quarterly basis, the social costs we accrue for share-based
compensation will also fluctuate significantly, which could result in our failing to meet our expectations or investor expectations for quarterly financial
performance. This could negatively impact investor sentiment for the Company, and as a result, adversely impact the price of our ordinary shares.

         Social costs are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation that we are subject to in various
countries in which we operate. This is not a withholding tax. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a social cost expense related to share-based
compensation of €71 million compared to a €64 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022.

          When the fair market value of our ordinary shares increases on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the accrued expense for social costs will increase, and when
the fair market value of ordinary shares falls, the accrued expense will become a reduction in social costs expense, all other things being equal, including the
number of vested stock options and exercise price remaining constant. The fair market value of our ordinary shares has been and will likely continue to be
volatile. See “—Risks Related to Owning Our Ordinary Shares—The trading price of our ordinary shares has been and will likely continue to be volatile.” As a
result, the accrued expense for social costs may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which could result in our failing to meet our expectations or
investor expectations for quarterly financial performance. This could negatively impact investor sentiment for the Company, and as a result, the price for our
ordinary shares.

          Approximately 18% of our employees are in Sweden. With respect to our employees in Sweden, we are required to pay a 31.42% tax to the Swedish
government on the profit an employee realizes on the exercise of our stock options or the vesting of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”). They accounted for a
total of 1,651,217 in vested options as of December 31, 2023 compared to a total of 2,401,797 in vested options as of December 31, 2022. We cannot
accurately predict how many of their vested options will remain outstanding. As a result, the cash payments to the Swedish government upon the exercise of
vested stock options may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

         Given our levels of share-based compensation, our effective tax rate may vary significantly depending on our share price.

          The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. When the tax
deduction related to equity compensation in the period is greater than the accounting expense for those awards, the resulting excess tax benefits will be
presented in equity. This means that although these excess benefits reduce our taxable income and our current tax liability, the benefit is reflected in equity
rather than in the consolidated statement of



                                                                                  29
Table of Contents



operations. There can be periods when our current tax liability is nil but we disclose an income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations (with an
offsetting credit in equity).

         These tax effects are dependent on our share price and level of exercises in a period, which we do not control and could significantly impact our
effective tax rate and adversely affect our operating results.

         Changes to tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including new proposals on taxing digital companies and the ongoing work by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

         Tax laws, including tax rates, in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
For example, effective in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period
and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. Additionally, various
governments and organizations such as the EU and the OECD are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax
revenue. For example, a number of jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering changes to the existing framework to calculate income and
non-income based taxes, including revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes that apply to our business.

         Over the last few years, the OECD has been discussing fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do
business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (referred to as “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” respectively). Work on Pillar One is continuing
with the goal of it entering into force in 2025. Certain aspects of Pillar Two are also not yet finalized. A number of countries have meanwhile enacted, are in the
process of enacting, or are considering domestic legislation to implement Pillar Two. Luxembourg enacted such legislation at the end of 2023, with application
as of January 1, 2024.

          Many of the types of changes described above, if and when agreed and enacted by various countries in which we do business, may increase our taxes
in these countries. Changes in profitability in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a substantial impact on our tax obligations. The timing and
ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations is uncertain.

           Changes in tax laws, treaties, or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement are unpredictable. Any of these occurrences could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, including changing the amount and recognition of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

        We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S.
Holders of our ordinary shares.

           We would be classified as a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for any taxable year if, after the application of certain look-through rules,
either: (i) 75% or more of our gross income for such year is “passive income” (as defined in the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended), or (ii) 50% or more of the value of our assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce
or are held for the production of passive income. Based on the trading price of our ordinary shares and the composition of our income, assets and operations,
we do not believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2023, nor that we will be a PFIC in
the foreseeable future. However, this is a factual determination that must be made annually after the close of each taxable year. Moreover, the value of our
assets for purposes of the PFIC determination may be determined by reference to the trading price of our ordinary shares, which could fluctuate significantly.
Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a PFIC in the future. Certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to
a U.S. Holder if we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which such U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares. Accordingly, each holder of our
ordinary shares should consult such holder’s tax advisor as to the potential effects of the PFIC rules.

        If a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such shareholder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income
tax consequences.

          If a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our ordinary shares,
such person may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with respect to each “controlled foreign corporation” in our group (if any). Because our group
includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether or not we
are treated as a controlled foreign corporation. A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include
in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income,” and



                                                                                 30
Table of Contents



investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States
shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed
to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a United States shareholder to
significant monetary penalties and may prevent the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for
which reporting was due from starting. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries
is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign
corporation or furnish to any United States shareholders information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax paying
obligations. A United States investor should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.

Risks Related to Owning Our Ordinary Shares

         The trading price of our ordinary shares has been and will likely continue to be volatile.

         The trading price of our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. In 2023, the trading price of our ordinary shares ranged from
$81.33 to $199.49. The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to the factors enumerated in this report, as well as
other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

    •    quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;
    •    the accuracy of our financial guidance or projections;
    •    our announcements or our competitors’ announcements regarding new services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions, or strategic
         investments;
    •    the overall performance of the equity markets, including fluctuations due to general macroeconomic uncertainty or negative market sentiment;
    •    any major change in our board of directors or management;
    •    publication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; and
    •    sales or expected sales, or repurchases or expected repurchases, of our ordinary shares by us, and our officers, directors, and significant shareholders.

          In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Price volatility over a given period may cause
the average price at which the Company repurchases its ordinary shares to exceed the trading price at a given point in time. Securities class action litigation has
often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. Such litigation, if
instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

         Provisions in our articles of association, the issuance of beneficiary certificates, and the existence of certain voting agreements may delay or
prevent our acquisition by a third party.

          Our articles of association contain provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the
approval of our board of directors and, if required, our shareholders. These provisions may also delay, prevent, or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer,
proxy contest, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares. The
provisions include, among others, the authorization granted by the general meeting of shareholders to our board of directors to issue ordinary shares within the
limits of the authorized share capital at such times and on such terms as our board of directors may decide for a maximum period of five years after the date of
publication in the Luxembourg official gazette (Recueil électronique des Sociétés et Associations, as applicable) of the minutes of the relevant general meeting
approving such authorization. The general meeting may amend, renew, or extend such authorized share capital and such authorization to the board of directors
to issue ordinary shares.

         The provisions of our articles of association could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay
for our ordinary shares in the future, which could reduce the trading price of our ordinary shares.

          Additionally, the issuance of beneficiary certificates also may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the
approval of our founders. See “—The issuance of beneficiary certificates to certain shareholders, including our founders, will limit your voting power and your
ability to influence the composition of the board of



                                                                                 31
Table of Contents



directors, strategy, or performance of the business. We cannot predict the impact that beneficiary certificates may have on our stock price.”

         We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

         We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our share capital. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for working capital and
general corporate purposes and do not expect to pay dividends or other distributions on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only
receive a return on your investment in our ordinary shares if you sell some or all of your ordinary shares after the trading price of our ordinary shares increases.
You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell your ordinary shares and you may lose the entire amount of the investment.

         Moreover, we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our direct and indirect ownership of shares in our subsidiaries. Our ability
to pay any future dividends is subject to restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, including the laws of the
relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, as well as any restrictions in the future indebtedness of our subsidiaries or on our ability
to receive dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries. Since we are expected to rely primarily on dividends from our direct and indirect subsidiaries to
fund our financial and other obligations, restrictions on our ability to receive such funds may adversely impact our ability to fund our financial and other
obligations.

         The issuance of beneficiary certificates to certain shareholders, including our founders, will limit your voting power and your ability to influence
the composition of the board of directors, strategy, or performance of the business. We cannot predict the impact that beneficiary certificates may have on
our stock price.

          Our shareholders have authorized the issuance of up to 1,400,000,000 beneficiary certificates to shareholders of the Company without reserving to our
existing shareholders a preemptive right to subscribe for the beneficiary certificates issued in the future. As of December 31, 2023, our founders, Daniel Ek and
Martin Lorentzon, beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, ordinary shares and beneficiary certificates representing 30.5% and 42.7% of the
combined voting power of all of our outstanding voting securities, respectively (or 73.2% in the aggregate). See “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders.” We may issue
additional beneficiary certificates under the total authorized amount at the discretion of our board of directors, of which our founders are members. Pursuant to
our articles of association, our beneficiary certificates may be issued at a ratio of between one and 20 beneficiary certificates per ordinary share as determined
by our board of directors or its delegate at the time of issuance. For example, in the future, we may issue to Mr. Ek up to 20 beneficiary certificates for each
ordinary share he receives upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, of which he currently holds 800,000. See “Item 6.B. Compensation—Compensation
Discussion & Analysis—Warrants.” Each beneficiary certificate entitles its holder to one vote. The beneficiary certificates carry no economic rights and are
issued to provide the holders of such beneficiary certificates with additional voting rights. The beneficiary certificates, subject to certain exceptions, may not be
transferred and will automatically be canceled for no consideration in the case of sale or transfer of the ordinary share to which they are linked. As a result, the
issuance of the beneficiary certificates and the voting power that they provide to the shareholders receiving those beneficiary certificates will limit the voting
power of minority shareholders and the ability of minority shareholders to influence the composition of the board of directors, strategy, or performance of our
business.

         As a result of this ownership or control of our voting securities, if our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially
all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors. This may delay or prevent an acquisition or cause the trading price of
our ordinary shares to decline. Our founders may have interests different from yours. Therefore, the concentration of voting power among our founders may
have an adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares.

         Sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market by our founders, affiliates, or non-affiliates, or the perception that such sales
could occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at a time and
price that you deem appropriate.

          Finally, we cannot predict whether the issuance of additional beneficiary certificates will result in a lower or more volatile trading price of our
ordinary shares or result in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, FTSE Russell requires new constituents of its indexes to have
greater than five percent of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public shareholders, and S&P Dow Jones will not admit companies with multiple-class
share structures to certain of its indexes. While we do not have a multiple-class share structure, we cannot predict if we would be excluded from these indexes
as a result of the issuance of beneficiary certificates and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of
investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these
funds and could make our ordinary shares less attractive to other investors. As a result, the trading price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected.




                                                                                 32

Risks Related to Investment in a Luxembourg Company and Our Status as a Foreign Private Issuer

         As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from a number of U.S. securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder and are permitted to publicly
disclose less information than U.S. companies must. This may limit the information available to holders of the ordinary shares.

         We currently qualify as a foreign private issuer, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, and, consequently, we are not subject to all of the
disclosure requirements applicable to companies organized within the United States. For example, we are exempt from certain rules under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that regulates disclosure obligations and procedural requirements related to the solicitation of proxies,
consents or authorizations applicable to a security registered under the Exchange Act. In addition, our officers and directors are exempt from the reporting and
“short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our securities. For
example, some of our key executives may sell a significant amount of ordinary shares, and such sales may not be required to be disclosed as promptly as sales
made by key executives of companies organized within the United States. Accordingly, once such sales are eventually disclosed, our ordinary share price may
decline significantly. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. public
companies. We are also not subject to Regulation FD under the Exchange Act, which would prohibit us from selectively disclosing material nonpublic
information to certain persons without concurrently making a widespread public disclosure of such information. Accordingly, there may be less publicly
available information concerning our company than there is for U.S. public companies.

         As a foreign private issuer, we are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the close of each fiscal year ended December
31 and furnish reports on Form 6-K relating to certain material events promptly after we publicly announce these events. However, because of the above
exemptions for foreign private issuers, our shareholders may not always be afforded the same information generally available to investors holding shares in
public companies that are not foreign private issuers.

         The rights of our shareholders may differ from the rights they would have as shareholders of a U.S. corporation, which could adversely impact
trading in our ordinary shares and our ability to conduct equity financings.

          Our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of association and the laws of Luxembourg, including the Luxembourg Company Law (loi du 10
août 1915 concernant les sociétés commerciales, telle qu’elle a été modifiée). The rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of our directors and
officers under Luxembourg law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the United States. See “Item 10.B. Memorandum and
Articles of Association” for an explanation of the differences. In addition, Luxembourg law governing the securities of Luxembourg companies may not be as
extensive as those in effect in the United States, and Luxembourg law and regulations in respect of corporate governance matters might not be as protective of
minority shareholders as state corporation laws in the United States. Therefore, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in
connection with actions taken by our directors and officers or our principal shareholders than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the
United States.

         We are organized under the laws of Luxembourg and a substantial amount of our assets are not located in the United States. It may be difficult for
you to obtain or enforce judgments or bring original actions against us or the members of our board of directors in the United States.

          We are organized under the laws of Luxembourg. In addition, a substantial amount of our assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore,
many of the members of our board of directors and officers reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the
United States. Investors may not be able to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or enforce judgments obtained against us
or these persons in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it may
also be difficult for an investor to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against us or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United
States, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Awards of punitive damages in actions brought in
the United States or elsewhere are generally not enforceable in Luxembourg.

          As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States
and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid judgment obtained
from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction in Luxembourg, subject to
compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur). The enforceability in Luxembourg courts of judgments rendered by U.S. courts will be subject, prior
to any enforcement in Luxembourg, to the procedure and the conditions set forth in the Luxembourg procedural code. In addition, actions brought in a
Luxembourg court against us, the members of our board of directors, or our officers to enforce liabilities based on U.S. federal securities laws may be subject
to certain restrictions. In particular, Luxembourg courts generally do not



                                                                                33
Table of Contents



award punitive damages. Litigation in Luxembourg also is subject to rules of procedure that differ from the U.S. rules. Proceedings in Luxembourg would have
to be conducted in the French or German language, and all documents submitted to the court would, in principle, have to be translated into French or German.
For these reasons, it may be difficult for a U.S. investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
U.S. federal securities laws against us, the members of our board of directors, or our officers. In addition, even if a judgment against the Company, the non-
U.S. members of our board of directors, or our officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws is obtained, a U.S. investor may
not be able to enforce it in U.S. or Luxembourg courts.

         Our articles of association provide that directors and officers, past and present, are entitled to indemnification from us to the fullest extent permitted by
Luxembourg law against all liability and expenses reasonably incurred or paid by him or her in connection with any claim, action, suit, or proceeding in which
he or she would be involved by virtue of his or her being or having been a director or officer and against amounts paid or incurred by him or her in the
settlement thereof, subject to limited exceptions. The rights to and obligations of indemnification among or between us and any of our current or former
directors and officers are generally governed by the laws of Luxembourg and subject to the jurisdiction of the Luxembourg courts, unless such rights or
obligations do not relate to or arise out of such persons’ capacities listed above. Although there is doubt as to whether U.S. courts would enforce this
indemnification provision in an action brought in the United States under U.S. federal or state securities laws, this provision could make it more difficult to
obtain judgments outside Luxembourg or from non-Luxembourg jurisdictions that would apply Luxembourg law against our assets in Luxembourg.

         Luxembourg and European insolvency and bankruptcy laws are substantially different from U.S. insolvency laws and may offer our shareholders
less protection than they would have under U.S. insolvency and bankruptcy laws.

         As a company organized under the laws of Luxembourg and with its registered office in Luxembourg, we are subject to Luxembourg insolvency and
bankruptcy laws in the event any insolvency proceedings are initiated against us including, among other things, Council and European Parliament Regulation
(EU) 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast). Should courts in another European country determine that the insolvency and bankruptcy
laws of that country apply to us in accordance with and subject to such EU regulations, the courts in that country could have jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings initiated against us. Insolvency and bankruptcy laws in Luxembourg or the relevant other European country, if any, may offer our shareholders less
protection than they would have under U.S. insolvency and bankruptcy laws and make it more difficult for them to recover the amount they could expect to
recover in a liquidation under U.S. insolvency and bankruptcy laws.


Item 4. Information on the Company


A. History and Development of the Company
           We are a Luxembourg public limited liability company (société anonyme), which means that shareholders’ liability is limited to their contributions to
the company. The shares forming the share capital of a Luxembourg public limited liability company (société anonyme) may be publicly traded and registered
on a stock exchange. Our legal name is “Spotify Technology S.A.” and our commercial name is “Spotify.” We were incorporated on December 27, 2006 as a
Luxembourg private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) and were transformed, on March 20, 2009, into a Luxembourg public limited
liability company (société anonyme). The principal legislation under which we operate, and under which our ordinary share capital has been created, is the law
of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, and the law of December 19, 2002 on the register of commerce and companies and the accounting
and annual accounts of undertakings and the regulations, as amended, made thereunder.
        We are registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies’ Register under number B.123.052. Our registered office is located at 5, place de la

B. Business Overview
        Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans
the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.
        We are the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service with a community of 602 million MAUs, including 236 million Premium
Subscribers, across 184 countries and territories as of December 31, 2023.

Spotify is the World's Most Popular Audio Streaming Subscription Service
          Spotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music and podcasts. Today, millions of people around the world have access to over
100 million tracks and 5 million podcast titles through Spotify whenever and wherever they want. In September 2022, we made available a catalog of
audiobooks in the United States that our users may purchase on the web and listen to on our platform alongside our catalog of music and podcasts. In
November 2022, we extended audiobooks availability to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Over 350,000 audiobooks are available à la
carte to listen to on Spotify in these markets. During 2023, we launched a new audiobooks experience on our Premium Service, offering 15 hours of access a
month to more than 200,000 audiobooks as part of a subscription to the Premium Service. Currently, audiobooks are available for eligible Premium Subscribers
in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.
         We have transformed the music industry by allowing users to move from a “transaction-based” experience of buying and owning music to an “access-
based” model, which allows users to stream music on demand. In contrast, traditional radio relies on a linear distribution model in which stations and channels
are programmed to deliver a limited song selection with little freedom of choice.
        We are actively investing in podcasts, audiobooks, and other forms of alternative and spoken word content to complement the music library available
through our platform. We believe offering a more diverse selection of content will lead to a more enriching experience and higher user engagement.
         Spotify is more than an audio streaming service. We are in the discovery business. Every day, fans from around the world trust our brand to guide
them to entertainment that they would never have discovered on their own. If discovery drives customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction drives
engagement, and engagement drives discovery, we believe Spotify wins and so do our users. Our brand reflects culture—and occasionally creates it—by
turning vast and intriguing listening data into compelling stories that remind people of the role music, podcasts, and other audio content play in their lives and
encourage new fans to join Spotify each week.

Building a Two-Sided Marketplace
          We continue to build a two-sided marketplace for users and creators, which leverages our relationships, data analytics, and software. We have been
instrumental in reshaping the way in which our users enjoy, discover, and share audio content. With our marketplace strategy, we are empowering creators by
offering unique insights and developing new tools designed to give creators more power and control and by unlocking new monetization opportunities for
creators. Spotify is uniquely positioned to offer creators and fans access to one another, and to provide creators with analytics and tools to help them better
understand their fans, to support themselves, and to effectively monetize their creative work.

Our Business Model
         We offer both Premium and Ad-Supported Services. Our Premium and Ad-Supported Services live independently, but thrive together. We believe this
business model has allowed us to achieve scale with attractive unit economics and is a critical



                                                                                 35
Table of Contents



part of our success. Our Ad-Supported Service serves as a funnel, driving a significant portion of our total gross added Premium Subscribers. We believe our
Ad-Supported Service is a strong and viable stand-alone product with considerable long-term opportunity for growth in Ad-Supported Users and revenue.
         We are currently in 184 countries and territories. On a geographic basis, all four of our major regions are growing. Europe is our largest region with
169 million MAUs, accounting for 28% of our total MAUs as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 14% from the prior year. In our North America region,
MAUs increased by 11% from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 and now account for 19% of our MAUs. Our two fastest growing regions are Latin
America, with 21% of our MAUs, an increase of 25% from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, and the rest of the world, with 32% of our MAUs, an
increase of 40% from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023.
         Our Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers spend significant time engaging with our Service. Combined, our audience streamed 165 billion
hours of content for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 25% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

Premium Service
         Our Premium Service provides Premium Subscribers with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to our catalog of music and
podcasts. Premium Subscribers in select markets have 15 hours of access a month to audiobooks as part of a subscription to the Premium Service, currently
available to eligible Premium Subscribers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Premium Subscribers can also purchase audiobooks on an à la carte basis in select
markets. In addition to accessing our catalog on computers, tablets, and mobile devices, users can connect through speakers, receivers, televisions, cars, game
consoles, and smart devices. The Premium Service offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks.
          We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of subscriptions to the Premium Service. The Premium Service is primarily sold
directly to end users. The Premium Service is also sold through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with
their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end customers. Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-
subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. We also bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.
         We offer a variety of subscription pricing plans for our Premium Service, including our Standard Plan, Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan,
among others, to appeal to users with different lifestyles and across various demographics and age groups. Our pricing varies by plan and is adapted to each
local market to align with consumer purchasing power, general cost levels, and willingness to pay for an audio service. Our Family Plan consists of one
primary Premium Subscriber and up to five additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan subscription. Our Duo Plan
consists of one primary subscriber and one additional sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan subscription.
         In addition, as we have entered into new markets where recurring subscription services are less common, we have expanded our subscription products
to include prepaid options and durations other than monthly (both longer and shorter durations), as well as expanded payment options.
         Revenue from our Premium segment is a function of the number of Premium Subscribers who subscribe to our Premium Service. As of December 31,
2023 and 2022, we had 236 million and 205 million Premium Subscribers, respectively. New Premium Subscribers are primarily sourced from the conversion
of our Ad-Supported Users. Through both our online platform and external marketing efforts, we engage our Ad-Supported Users by highlighting key features
that encourage conversion to our subscription offerings. These efforts include product links, campaigns targeting existing users, and performance marketing
across leading social media platforms. Additionally, new subscriber growth is also driven by the success of converting users from our trial programs to full-
time Premium Subscribers. These trial campaigns typically offer certain features of our Premium Service for free or at a discounted price for a period of time.

Ad-Supported Service
         Our Ad-Supported Service has no subscription fees and generally provides Ad-Supported Users with limited on-demand online access to our catalog
of music and unlimited online access to our catalog of podcasts on their computers, tablets, and compatible mobile devices. Ad-Supported Users can also
purchase audiobooks on an à la carte basis in select markets. Our Ad-Supported Service serves as both a Premium Subscriber acquisition channel and a robust
option for users who are unable or unwilling to pay a monthly subscription fee but still want to enjoy access to a wide variety of high-quality audio content.
          We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising
impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on behalf of their
clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-thousand basis
and are evidenced by an insertion order that specifies the terms of the arrangement such as the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and



                                                                               36
Table of Contents



number of impressions or downloads in a stated period ("Insertion Order"). Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising
automated exchanges, internal self-serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis.
These advertising arrangements typically specify the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions in a stated period.
          Revenue from our Ad-Supported segment is dependent primarily on the number and hours of engagement of our Ad-Supported Users and podcast
listeners and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to those users and enhance returns for our advertising partners. Revenue is
recognized based on the number of impressions delivered.
         Our advertising strategy centers on the belief that advertising products that are based in music and podcasts and are relevant to Ad-Supported Users
and podcast listeners can enhance user experiences and provide even greater returns for advertisers. We have historically introduced, and continue to introduce,
new advertising products across both music and podcast content. Offering advertisers additional ways to purchase advertising on an automated basis is a key
way that we continue to expand our portfolio of advertising products and enhance advertising revenue. Furthermore, we continue to focus on analytics and
measurement tools to evaluate, demonstrate, and improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on our platform.
         In February 2021, we announced the Spotify Audience Network (“SPAN”), an audio advertising marketplace that connects advertisers to listeners
across our owned and exclusive podcasts, podcasts from enterprise publishers via Megaphone, and podcasts from emerging creators via Spotify for Podcasters.
Through SPAN, we provide hosting and ad-insertion capabilities for audio publishers that allow us to sell targeted advertising to brand partners that enables
them to reach listeners both on and off our platform. Some of these agreements require us to share associated revenues and can include minimum guarantees.

Licensing Agreements
          In order to stream content to our users, we generally secure intellectual property rights to such content by obtaining licenses from, and paying royalties
or other consideration to, rights holders or their agents. Certain of these license agreements also provide for minimum guaranteed payments or advance
payment obligations. Below is a summary of certain provisions of our license agreements relating to sound recordings and the musical compositions embodied
therein (i.e., the musical notes and the lyrics), as well as podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content.

Sound Recording License Agreements with Major and Independent Record Labels
         We have license agreements with record label affiliates of the three largest music companies—Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment,
and Warner Music Group—as well as Merlin, which represents the digital rights on behalf of hundreds of independent record labels. These agreements require
us to pay royalties. They also often include marketing commitments, advertising inventory, financial and data reporting obligations, and numerous prescriptions
about the manner in which the Spotify service is operated. Rights to sound recordings granted pursuant to these agreements accounted for approximately 74%
of streams of audio content delivered by record labels for the year ended December 31, 2023. Generally, these license agreements have a multi-year duration,
are not automatically renewable, and apply worldwide. The license agreements also allow for the record label to terminate the agreement in certain
circumstances, including, for example, our failure to pay sums due within a certain period, our breach of material terms, and in some situations that could
constitute a “change of control” of Spotify. These agreements provide that the record labels have the right to audit us for compliance with the terms of these
agreements. Further, some agreements contain “most favored nations” provisions, which require that certain material contract terms are at least as favorable as
the terms we have agreed to with other record labels. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—Financial
commitments required under certain of our license agreements may limit our operating flexibility and may adversely affect our business, operating results, and
financial condition.”
         We also have direct license agreements with hundreds of independent labels, as well as companies known as “aggregators” (for example, CDBaby,
Distrokid, and TuneCore). The majority of these agreements have a multi-year duration, are generally automatically renewable, and apply worldwide (subject
to agreement on rates with certain rights holders prior to launching in new territories) but others, with local repertoire, are limited to specific territories. These
agreements have financial and data reporting obligations and audit rights.
         We also offer marketplace programs, some of which may result in a discounted recording royalty rate.

Musical Composition License Agreements with Music Publishers
         We generally obtain licenses for two types of rights with respect to musical compositions: mechanical rights and public performance rights.
       With respect to mechanical rights, in the United States, the rates that the Copyright Royalty Board set apply to compositions that we license under the
compulsory license in Section 115 of the Copyright Act. In January 2021, we obtained a



                                                                                  37
Table of Contents



new blanket compulsory license available under U.S. law, administered by an entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective. The Copyright Royalty Board
set the rates for the Section 115 compulsory license for calendar years 2018 to 2022 in proceedings known as the “Phonorecords III Proceedings.” On August
10, 2023, the Copyright Royalty Board issued final regulations for the Phonorecords III period.
         In 2022, the proceedings known as “Phonorecords IV Proceedings” began to set the rates for the Section 115 blanket compulsory license for calendar
years 2023 to 2027. In August 2022, we and other service providers reached an agreement in principle with publisher organizations for these rates and terms
and asked the Copyright Royalty Board to adopt those rates and terms on an industry-wide basis. In December 2022, the Copyright Royalty Board issued final
regulations adopting the parties' proposed rates and terms on an industry-wide basis for the Phonorecords IV period. Royalty rates beginning on January 1,
2028 may differ from those in effect today and are subject to change as part of future Copyright Royalty Board proceedings.
          In the United States, public performance rights are generally obtained through intermediaries known as performing rights organizations (“PROs”),
which negotiate blanket licenses with copyright users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory, collect royalties under such licenses, and
distribute those royalties to copyright owners. We have obtained public performance licenses from, and pay license fees to, the major PROs in the United States
—ASCAP, BMI, GMR, and SESAC—among others. These agreements have music usage reporting obligations on Spotify and typically have one to four-year
terms, and are limited to the territory of the United States and its territories and possessions.
         In other parts of the world, we obtain mechanical and performance licenses for musical compositions either through local collecting societies
representing publishers or from publishers directly, or a combination thereof. Our license agreements with local collecting societies and direct license
agreements with publishers worldwide are generally in place for one to three years and provide for reporting obligations on both us and the licensor and
auditing rights for the licensors.

Podcast License Agreements with Podcasters and Podcast Networks

          With respect to podcasts for which we obtain distribution rights directly from rights holders, we either negotiate licenses directly with individuals or
entities or obtain rights through our owned and operated services, such as Spotify for Podcasters, that enable creators to distribute content to our Service after
agreeing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions.
       For original content that we produce or commission, we typically enter into multi-year commitments. Payment terms for content that we produce or
commission will often require partial payments in advance of complete delivery of content. Some of these agreements also include financial participations,
which may require us to share associated revenues, and other payments contingent on performance of the content.

Audiobook License Agreements with Audiobook Publishers and Authors

          With respect to audiobooks for which we obtain distribution rights directly from rights holders, we either negotiate licenses with audiobook publishers
or authors or obtain rights through our owned and operated service, Findaway Voices by Spotify, that enables creators to distribute content to our Service after
agreeing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions. These licenses are generally consumption-based, with royalties paid on a quarterly or monthly
basis. In addition, we obtain the rights to produce and distribute audiobooks from book publishers and authors.

License Agreement Extensions and Renewals

         From time to time, our license agreements with certain rights holders and/or their agents expire while we negotiate their renewals. Per industry custom
and practice, we may enter into extensions of those agreements (for example, months, weeks, or even days-long) or provisional licenses and/or continue to
operate on an at will basis as if the license agreement had been extended, including by our continuing to make content available. It is also possible that such
agreements will never be renewed at all. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—We depend upon
third-party licenses for most of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may materially
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.”

Intellectual Property

          The success of our business depends on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including the intellectual property rights
underlying our Service. We attempt to protect our intellectual property under patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws through a combination of
intellectual property registration, employee or third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements, other contractual restrictions, technological measures, and
other methods.




                                                                                 38

Seasonality

         See “Item 5.D. Trend Information” for a description of the seasonality of our business.

Competition

        We face robust, complex, and rapidly evolving competition in all aspects of our business, with established and emerging competitors, on the basis of a
number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, diversity of content, ease of use, price, accessibility, perception of advertising load, brand
awareness, reputation, presence and visibility. Specifically, we compete with:

    •    free and/or subscription-based digital music streaming providers, such as Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, Joox, Pandora,
         SoundCloud, and TikTok Music, for high-quality music content and the time and attention of our users;
    •    online or offline providers of on-demand music, which may be purchased, downloaded, owned, or available for free, such as iTunes audio files, MP3s,
         or CDs;
    •    providers of internet radio, some of which, such as Pandora, may leverage their advantage in content library, territorial coverage, existing
         infrastructure, and brand recognition to introduce additional streaming or on-demand music features to enhance user experience;
    •    well-established providers of terrestrial radio, which often offer content that is free, unique and accessible; many terrestrial radio stations also
         broadcast digital signals providing high-quality audio transmission;
    •    providers of satellite radio, such as SiriusXM, which may offer extensive and exclusive news, comedy, sports and talk content, and national signal
         coverage;
    •    podcast streaming providers, such as Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Audible, Facebook, Pandora, Deezer, and TuneIn, for high-quality podcasts and time
         and attention of our users; a growing variety of these podcast providers seek to differentiate their service through content offering, product features,
         and monetization ability;
    •    podcast creation and hosting platforms, including Acast, Buzzsprout, Podbean, and Libsyn;
    •    live talk audio content providers, such as X (formerly known as Twitter), Discord, Meta (including Facebook and Instagram), and ByteDance
         (including TikTok and Resso), for the rights to distribute content and time and attention of our users;
    •    audiobook content providers, such as Amazon’s Audible, Apple Books, Google Audiobooks, Librivox, Kobo Audiobooks, Downpour, Storytel, and
         BookBeat, for the rights to distribute content and time and attention of our users;
    •    companies that offer advertising inventory and opportunities, including large online advertising platforms and networks such as Google, Apple,
         Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta (including Facebook and Instagram).

         With respect to each of these categories (and potentially in additional categories as we innovate our existing offerings and/or introduce new products
and services), we face significant competition from these companies and from emerging technologies. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business Model, Strategy, and Performance—We face and will continue to face significant competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers.”
         Additionally, competition to attract and retain qualified personnel has historically been intense, especially for software engineers, designers, and
product managers. We seek to compete by offering robust compensation, benefits, health, safety and wellness programs, and cultivating a diverse, inclusive
culture.

Government Regulation

         We are subject to many U.S. federal and state, European, Luxembourg, and other foreign laws and regulations, including those related to privacy, data
protection, content, intellectual property, advertising and marketing, competition, consumer protection, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and
labor, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our
business. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the
accessibility or usability of any or all of our products for an extended period of time or indefinitely.

         For more information, see “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and
regulations around the world. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our
business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.” and “—
Various existing, new, and changing laws and regulations as well as self-regulation and public concern related to privacy and data security pose the threat of
lawsuits, regulatory fines, other liability and reputational harm, require us to expend significant resources, and may harm our business, operating results, and
financial condition.”

Human Capital

         At Spotify, we know that when our employees grow, Spotify grows. We value innovation, sincerity, passion, collaboration, and playfulness. Our
objective is to unlock the potential of human creativity by focusing on talent development, supported by robust compensation, benefits, health, safety and
wellness programs, and a diverse, inclusive culture.

Talent Development

         We enable and empower our employees' growth by offering a number of learning opportunities through a variety of platforms and delivery methods,
including face-to-face sessions, virtual and online sessions, and coaching. We host onboarding events and programs for new employees to learn about Spotify
and how to grow their careers at Spotify. We provide development opportunities for both new and seasoned managers to learn how to lead, inspire their direct
reports and peers, and shape organizational culture. We also invest heavily in team development to promote the best conditions for leaders and employees to
learn and execute. With the help of our internal talent marketplace, we also offer learning opportunities on the job by connecting employees with projects, jobs,
and mentorships to support our internal mobility efforts. In our bi-yearly development talks, managers and employees set a development plan for future
development opportunities specific to each individual.

Compensation and Benefits
         We provide competitive compensation for our employees and a range of flexible benefits, including a tailored incentive mix program, giving our
employees the flexibility to choose the incentive mix that best works for them, an industry-leading parental leave policy, flexible public holidays, and one full
day of paid time off a year for our employees to give back to social causes of their choice. We continue to embrace our Work from Anywhere program adopted
in 2021 that allows most employees to elect their work location from physical office space and home mix options.

Health, Safety, and Wellness

         We provide our employees and their families with robust healthcare benefits and a variety of mental health and wellness programs. Through Heart &
Soul, our global mental health initiative, we focus on raising awareness and building knowledge, enabling self-care and professional support, and normalizing
the conversation around mental health issues.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion


          We are dedicated to fostering a workplace free from discrimination and a culture built on the principle of inclusion. Our Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion team focused on accelerating diversity, designing for equity, fostering inclusive leadership, enabling good mental health, co-designing equitable ways
of working, building a culture of allyship, and amplifying a sense of belonging. During 2023, we continued our efforts to build a diverse team that attracts and
retains talent from historically marginalized and/or underrepresented backgrounds. To do this, we designed educational programs for inclusive hiring practices
with a shift to internal mobility and introduced multiple bias interrupters into the recruiting process. We also continued to support a growing number of
Belonging Groups that are open to all employees and help foster belonging and inclusion for our historically marginalized and/or underrepresented talent. We
also launched an internal Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion hub with all of our resources and engagement content.
         See “Item 6.D. Employees” for more information about our employees.
        From time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater operating efficiencies and realign our strategic priorities. In 2023, we
announced several such initiatives, including reductions in our employee base. We made it a priority to treat departing employees with empathy and respect. All
impacted employees had a 1:1 meeting with HR and were provided with the following package:

    •    Severance: starting with a baseline amount for all employees, plus additional months depending on employee location, tenure, notice period and other
         factors, with the average departing employee receiving approximately five months of severance and notice pay;
    •    Paid time off: payment for all accrued and unused vacation;
    •    Healthcare: coverage of the cost of healthcare during the severance period;
    •    Immigration support: our Global Mobility team works with each impacted employee based on their needs; and
    •    Career support: outplacement services for two months.




                                                                               40

Environmental Sustainability


        We strive to be part of the solution for addressing the climate crisis through our operations. Our approach focuses on two main areas of impact—
reducing our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and using our platform to inspire and support climate engagement and action among creators and listeners.
         As a digital platform, approximately 99% of our GHG emissions are Scope 3, which means they fall outside our direct control. We are teaming up
with academics and partners across our value chain to investigate how we can better measure and understand these emissions as we continue our work to set
tangible reduction pathways.
         In 2023, we continued to drive initiatives to reach our long-term goal of net zero emissions by the end of 2030 by identifying levers to reduce our
climate impact, together with key partners, industry associates, and academic institutions.
         We continue to leverage our platform to raise awareness of the climate crisis by creating climate change content, including several original podcasts,
as well as curating content by updating our Climate Action hub to make climate-related content more accessible to users.
         As we execute our sustainability initiatives, we expect to incur additional costs. Timing and investments to implement our sustainability initiatives are
subject to uncertainties. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—We are subject to risks associated with increased scrutiny of
environmental, social, and governance matters.”

D. Property, Plant and Equipment
         Spotify’s principal operational offices are located in Stockholm, Sweden and New York, New York under leases for approximately 485,000 and
594,000 square feet of office space, respectively, expiring in December 2028 and April 2034, respectively. We also lease regional offices in Los Angeles,
California; San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Atlanta, Georgia; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Washington D.C.
We also lease other offices in Sweden and lease office space in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Argentina, Indonesia, Ireland, South Africa, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the
United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.
          During 2023, as a result of our Work From Anywhere program and a comprehensive review of our real estate footprint and space utilization trends
(collectively, the “Office Space Optimization Initiative”), we made the strategic decision to reduce our real estate footprint in certain locations and initiate
subleases of these leased office spaces. As a result of this initiative,



                                                                                 41

during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of €123 million, which represents the write-down of these real estate
assets, including lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. See Note 3 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this report for additional information.
        We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as
needed to accommodate any further physical expansion of operations and for any additional offices.

Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects
         For discussion related to our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, refer to Part I,
Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with
the SEC on February 2, 2023.

Overview
        Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans
the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.
         We are the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service. With a presence in 184 countries and territories, our platform includes 602
million MAUs and 236 million Premium Subscribers as of December 31, 2023.
       We currently monetize our Service through both subscriptions and advertising. Our Premium Subscribers grew 15% year-over-year as of
December 31, 2023 to 236 million. Our 602 million MAUs grew 23% year-over-year as of December 31, 2023.

Launch of audiobooks
         In September 2022, we made available a catalog of audiobooks in the United States that our users may purchase on the web and listen to on our
platform alongside our catalog of music and podcasts. In November 2022, we extended audiobooks availability to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and
New Zealand. Over 350,000 audiobooks are available à la carte to listen to on Spotify in these markets. During 2023, we launched a new audiobooks
experience on our Premium Service, offering 15 hours of access a month to more than 200,000 audiobooks as part of a subscription to the Premium Service.
Currently, audiobooks are available for eligible Premium Subscribers in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.

Reorganization
         In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company announced a reorganization to streamline our organizational structure and reduce our operating costs.
As part of such reorganization, we reduced our employee base by approximately 6% across the Company. In the second fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company
executed a strategic realignment and reorganization plan focusing on podcast operations and to rationalize our content portfolio. Additionally, in the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company announced a reduction in force, through which we reduced our employee base by approximately 17% across the Company.
In connection with these events, we recognized charges of €212 million for employee severance during the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 6 and
Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details.

Impairment of real estate assets
        As a result of the Office Space Optimization Initiative, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of
€123 million, which represents the write-down of these real estate assets, including lease right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements and property and
equipment. See Note 3 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details.

Current macroeconomic environment
        The global macroeconomic environment continues to be uncertain, reflecting the impacts of inflation, changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts
in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty. We will continue to actively monitor and respond accordingly to the macroeconomic
environment.

How We Generate Revenue
         We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments—Premium and Ad-Supported. We identify our reportable segments based on the
organizational units used by the chief operating decision maker to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 24 to our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our reportable segments.

Premium
         Our Premium Service provides Premium Subscribers with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to our catalog of music and
podcasts. Premium Subscribers in select markets have 15 hours of access a month to audiobooks as part of a subscription to the Premium Service, currently
available to eligible Premium Subscribers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Premium Subscribers can also purchase audiobooks on an à la carte basis in select
markets. In addition to accessing our catalog on computers, tablets, and mobile devices, users can connect through speakers, receivers, televisions, cars, game
consoles, and smart devices. The Premium Service offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks.
          We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of subscriptions to the Premium Service. The Premium Service is primarily sold
directly to end users. The Premium Service is also sold through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with
their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end customers. Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-
subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. We also bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.
         We offer a variety of subscription pricing plans for our Premium Service, including our Standard Plan, Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan,
among others, to appeal to users with different lifestyles and across various demographics and age groups. Our pricing varies by plan and is adapted to each
local market to align with consumer purchasing power, general cost levels, and willingness to pay for an audio service. Our Family Plan consists of one
primary Premium Subscriber and up to five additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan subscription. Our Duo Plan
consists of one primary subscriber and one additional sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan subscription.
         In addition, as we have entered into new markets where recurring subscription services are less common, we have expanded our subscription products
to include prepaid options and durations other than monthly (both longer and shorter durations), as well as expanded payment options.
         Revenue from our Premium segment is a function of the number of Premium Subscribers who subscribe to our Premium Service. As of December 31,
2023 and 2022, we had 236 million and 205 million Premium Subscribers, respectively. New Premium Subscribers are primarily sourced from the conversion
of our Ad-Supported Users. Through both our online platform and external marketing efforts, we engage our Ad-Supported Users by highlighting key features
that encourage conversion to our subscription offerings. These efforts include product links, campaigns targeting existing users, and performance marketing
across leading social media platforms. Additionally, new subscriber growth is also driven by the success of converting users from our trial programs to full-
time Premium Subscribers. These trial campaigns typically offer certain features of our Premium Service for free or at a discounted price for a period of time.
         The rate of net growth in Premium Subscribers is also affected by our ability to retain our existing Premium Subscribers and the mix of subscription
pricing plans. We have increased retention over time, as new features and functionality have led to increased user engagement and satisfaction. From a product
perspective, while our Family Plan, Duo Plan, and our Student Plan have lower price points per Premium Subscriber than our Standard plan, each of these
Plans has helped improve retention across the Premium Service.
         Our platform is built to work across multiple devices, including smartphones, desktops, cars, game consoles, and in-home devices. We have found that
Premium Subscribers who access our Service through multiple devices have higher engagement and lower churn, which increases their expected lifetime value
to Spotify.

Ad-Supported
         Our Ad-Supported Service has no subscription fees and generally provides Ad-Supported Users with limited on-demand online access to our catalog
of music and unlimited online access to our catalog of podcasts on their computers, tablets, and compatible mobile devices. Ad-Supported Users can also
purchase audiobooks on an à la carte basis in select markets. Our Ad-Supported Service serves as both a Premium Subscriber acquisition channel and a robust
option for users who are unable or unwilling to pay a monthly subscription fee but still want to enjoy access to a wide variety of high-quality audio content.
          We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising
impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on behalf of their
clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-thousand basis
and are evidenced by an



                                                                               43

Insertion Order. Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal self-serve, and advertising
marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis.
          Revenue from our Ad-Supported segment is dependent primarily on the number and hours of engagement of our Ad-Supported Users and podcast
listeners and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to those users and enhance returns for our advertising partners. Revenue is
recognized based on the number of impressions delivered.
         Our advertising strategy centers on the belief that advertising products that are based in music and podcasts and are relevant to Ad-Supported Users
and podcast listeners can enhance user experiences and provide even greater returns for advertisers. We have historically introduced, and continue to introduce,
new advertising products across both music and podcast content. Offering advertisers additional ways to purchase advertising on an automated basis is a key
way that we continue to expand our portfolio of advertising products and enhance advertising revenue. Furthermore, we continue to focus on analytics and
measurement tools to evaluate, demonstrate, and improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on our platform.
         In February 2021, we announced SPAN, an audio advertising marketplace that connects advertisers to listeners across our owned and exclusive
podcasts, podcasts from enterprise publishers via Megaphone, and podcasts from emerging creators via Spotify for Podcasters. Through SPAN, we provide
hosting and ad-insertion capabilities for audio publishers that allow us to sell targeted advertising to brand partners that enables them to reach listeners both on
and off our platform. Some of these agreements require us to share associated revenues and can include minimum guarantees.
          Revenue from our Ad-Supported segment will also be impacted by the demographic profile of our Ad-Supported Users and podcast listeners and our
ability to enable advertisers to reach their target audience with relevant advertising in the geographic markets in which we operate. A large percentage of our
Ad-Supported Users are between 18 and 34 years old. This is a highly sought-after demographic that has traditionally been difficult for advertisers to reach. By
offering advertisers increased “self-serve options,” we continue to improve the efficiency and scalability of our advertising platforms. Additionally, we believe
that our largest markets, including Europe and North America, are among the top advertising markets globally. However, our continuing expansion into new
geographic markets will present monetization challenges. Monetizing our Ad-Supported User base has historically been, and is expected to remain, more
challenging in our two fastest growing regions, Latin America and the rest of the world, compared to Europe and North America.

Components of our Operating Results
          Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming. We incur royalty costs, which
we pay to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders, for the right to stream content to our users. Music royalties are typically calculated
monthly based on the combination of a number of different variables. Generally, Premium Service royalties are based on the greater of a percentage of revenue
and a per user amount. Royalties for the Ad-Supported Service are typically a percentage of relevant revenue, although certain agreements are based on the
greater of a percentage of relevant revenue and an amount for each time a track is streamed. We have negotiated lower per user amounts for our lower priced
subscription plans such as our Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan. In our agreements with certain record labels, the percentage of revenue used in the
calculation of royalties is generally dependent upon certain targets being met. The targets can include such measures as the number of Premium Subscribers,
the ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, and/or the rates of Premium Subscriber churn. In addition, royalty rates vary by country. Some of our
royalty agreements require that royalty costs be paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. For the majority of royalty agreements,
incremental costs incurred due to unrecouped advances and minimum guarantees have not been significant to date. We also have certain so-called most favored
nation royalty agreements, which require us to record additional costs if certain material contract terms are not as favorable as the terms we have agreed to with
similar licensors. Cost of revenue also reflects discounts provided by certain rights holders in return for promotional activities in connection with marketplace
programs. Additionally, it includes the costs of discounted trials. Royalties payable in relation to audiobook licenses are generally consumption-based.
         Cost of revenue also includes the cost of podcast content assets (both produced and licensed). Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded over
the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period (if relevant) and begins at the release of each episode. We make payments to podcast
publishers, whose content we monetize through advertising sales in SPAN, which are also included in cost of revenue.
        Cost of revenue also includes credit card and payment processing fees for subscription revenue, advertising serving, advertising measurement,
customer service, certain employee compensation and benefits, cloud computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs.

         Research and Development. We invest heavily in research and development in order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction on our
platform, which we believe helps drive organic growth in MAUs, which in turn drives additional



                                                                                 44
Table of Contents




growth in, and better retention of, Premium Subscribers, as well as increased advertising opportunities to our users. We aim to design products and features that
create and enhance user experiences, and new technologies are at the core of many of these opportunities. Research and development expenses were 13%,
12%, and 9% of our total revenue in each of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for the development of products
related to our platform and Service, as well as new advertising products and improvements to our mobile application and desktop application and streaming
services. The costs incurred include related facility costs, consulting costs, and employee compensation and benefits costs. We expect engineers to represent a
significant portion of our employees over the foreseeable future.
        Many of our new products and improvements to our platform require large investments and involve substantial time and risks to develop and launch.
Some of these products may not be well received or may take a long time for users to adopt. As a result, the benefits of our research and development
investments are difficult to forecast.

        Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, public relations, branding, consulting
expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, marketing events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with
music record labels, publishers, songwriters, and artists to promote the availability of new releases on our platform, and the costs of providing free trials.
Expenses included in the cost of providing free trials are derived primarily from per user royalty fees determined in accordance with the rights holder
agreements.

         General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits for functions such as
finance, accounting, analytics, legal, human resources, consulting fees, and other costs including facility and equipment costs, directors' and officers’ liability
insurance, and director fees.

Key Performance Indicators
         We use certain key performance indicators to monitor and manage our business. We use these indicators to evaluate our business, measure our
performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe these indicators provide useful
information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner we do.

MAUs
          We track MAUs as an indicator of the size of the audience engaged with our Service. We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users and
Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated. Reported MAUs may
overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Service within a thirty-day period as one individual may register for, and use, multiple
accounts. Additionally, though we strive to detect and minimize non-bona fide accounts that may typically be created in an attempt to artificially stream
content, they may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement in our reported MAUs. Our MAUs in the tables below are inclusive of Ad-Supported
Users who may have employed methods to limit or otherwise avoid being served advertisements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed
under “Item 3.D. Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
         The table below sets forth our MAUs as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.
                                                                             As of December 31,                                            Change

MAUs                                                                   602              489          406            113                  23 %       83              20 %

        MAUs were 602 million as of December 31, 2023. This represented an increase of 23% from the preceding fiscal year. MAUs increased due to our
continued investment in driving the growth of our Service through successful consumer marketing campaigns, enhanced content offerings, and product
enhancements, resulting in continued user engagement and customer satisfaction.

Premium Subscribers
         We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for Premium Service.
Our Premium Subscribers include all registered accounts in our Family Plan and Duo Plan. Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five
additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan Subscription. Our Duo Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to one
additional sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan Subscription. Premium Subscribers include subscribers in a grace period of up
to 30 days after failing to pay their subscription fee.



                                                                                   45

enhanced content offerings, and product enhancements, resulting in continued Ad-Supported User engagement and customer satisfaction.

Premium ARPU
          Premium ARPU is a monthly measure defined as Premium revenue recognized in the quarter indicated divided by the average daily Premium
Subscribers in such quarter, which is then divided by three months. Annual figures are calculated by averaging Premium ARPU for the four quarters in such
fiscal year.
        The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.
                                                                       Year ended December 31,                                                Change

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, Premium ARPU was €4.39. This represented a decrease of 3% from the preceding fiscal year. The decrease of
€0.13 was primarily driven by changes in product and market mix, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.15, as well as unfavorable movements in foreign
exchange rates, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.13. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Premium ARPU of €0.15 as a result of price
increases.
        The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the quarters ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

         For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, Premium ARPU was €4.60. This represented an increase of 1% year-over-year. The increase of €0.05 was
primarily driven by an increase in Premium ARPU of €0.39 as a result of price increases. The increase was partially offset by changes in product and market
mix, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.18 as well as unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.17.

Premium revenue
        For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Premium revenue comprised 87% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2023, as
compared to 2022, Premium revenue increased by €1,315 million or 13%. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of Premium
Subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in Premium ARPU of 3%, as noted above.

Ad-Supported revenue
         For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 13% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2023,
as compared to 2022, Ad-Supported revenue increased by €205 million or 14%. This increase was due primarily to growth in music impressions sold which
increased revenue in our direct and programmatic channels by €129 million. Ad sales from podcasts, partially offset by our self-serve platform, also increased
by €64 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Foreign exchange impact on total revenue
         The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared
to 2022, had an unfavorable net impact on our revenue. We estimate that total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 would have been approximately
€399 million higher if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Premium cost of revenue
          For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, Premium cost of revenue increased by €876 million, or 12%, and Premium cost of
revenue as a percentage of Premium revenue decreased from 72% to 71%. The increase in Premium cost of revenue was driven primarily by increases in
Premium revenue and audiobook licensing costs, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs. These collectively resulted in higher royalty
costs of €814 million. Additionally, there was an increase in payment processing fees of €26 million, partially offset by decreased streaming delivery costs of
€10 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The year ended December 31, 2022 included a charge of €24 million related to excess and obsolete
inventory and adverse purchase commitments.

Ad-Supported cost of revenue
          For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, Ad-Supported cost of revenue increased by €173 million, or 12%, and Ad-Supported
cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue decreased from 98% to 96%. The increase in Ad-Supported cost of revenue was driven primarily by
an increase in content costs of €125 million due primarily to growth in both advertising revenue and streams, partially offset by benefits from certain
marketplace programs and a decrease in costs incurred to deliver enhanced product features of €32 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The cost in
2023 also includes a €29 million charge for the write-off of content assets, a €12 million charge for employee severance, an €8 million charge for contract
terminations and other related costs and a €6 million charge for impairment on real estate assets.

Foreign exchange impact on total cost of revenue
         The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared
to 2022, had a favorable net impact on our cost of revenue. We estimate that total cost for the year ended December 31, 2023 would have been approximately
€305 million higher, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2022.

          For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, Premium gross profit increased by €439 million and Premium gross margin increased
from 28% to 29%. Premium gross margin increased due primarily to benefits from certain marketplace programs and reduced streaming delivery costs,
partially offset by increases in audiobook licensing costs. Also contributing to the increase in gross margin was a €24 million charge related to excess and
obsolete inventory and adverse purchase commitments during the year ended December 31, 2022, with no comparable charges for the year ended
December 31, 2023.

Ad-Supported gross profit and gross margin
         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, Ad-Supported gross profit increased by €32 million to a gross profit of €62 million, and
Ad-Supported gross margin increased from 2% to 4%. The increase in Ad-Supported gross margin was due primarily to revenue growth outpacing the growth
in content costs. Also contributing to the increase in gross margin were benefits from certain marketplace programs, a decrease in costs incurred to deliver
enhanced product features during the year ended December 31, 2023, partially offset by an increase in royalty costs. Additionally, the increase in gross margin
was partially offset by a €29 million charge for the write-off of content assets during the year ended December 31, 2023, with no comparable charges for the
year ended December 31, 2022.

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, research and development costs increased by €338 million, or 24%, as we continually
enhance our platform to retain and grow our user base. The increase was due primarily to an increase in personnel-related costs of €153 million that included
increased salaries and other employee benefits as a result of increased headcount, and an increase in social costs of €86 million due primarily to changes in
share price movements. In addition, there were employee severance costs of €119 million and real estate impairment charges of €75 million. There was also an
increase in information technology costs of €15 million due to an increase in our usage of cloud computing services and additional software license fees. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs for consultants and external contractors of €31 million, a decrease in employee travel of €27 million, and a
decrease in share-based compensation of €24 million.
         The increases in research and development costs described above include the impact of foreign exchange rate movements during the respective
periods. A significant portion of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar which weakened 3% against the Euro for the year ended
December 31, 2023, partially offsetting the overall increase in operating expenses.

Sales and marketing
                                                                       Year ended December 31,                                           Change

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, sales and marketing expense decreased by €39 million, or 2%. The decrease was due
primarily to a decrease in advertising costs of €151 million. There was also a decrease in employee travel of €16 million, a decrease in consulting fees of €8
million, and a decrease in share-based compensation of €7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other personnel-related costs of €51
million that included salaries and other employee benefits as a result of increased headcount, and an increase in social costs of €29 million due primarily to
changes in share price movements. In addition, there were employee severance costs of €44 million and impairment charges on real estate assets of €23 million
during the year ended December 31, 2023.
          The decreases in sales and marketing expenses described above include the impact of foreign exchange rate movements during the respective periods.

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, general and administrative expense decreased by €41 million or 7%. The decrease was
due primarily to a decrease in legal fees of €30 million, a decrease in share-based compensation of €27 million, and a decrease in other administrative costs of
€23 million. There was also a decrease in employee travel of €14 million and a decrease in costs for consultants and external contractors of €11 million. These
decreases were partially offset by employee severance costs of €34 million and impairment charges on real estate assets of €18 million for

the year ended December 31, 2023. There was also an increase in social costs of €18 million due primarily to changes in share price movements.
         The decreases in general and administrative expenses described above include the impact of foreign exchange rate movements during the respective
periods. A significant portion of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar which weakened 3% against the Euro for the year ended
December 31, 2023, partially offsetting the overall increase in operating expenses.

Foreign exchange impact on total operating expenses
        The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as
compared to 2022, had a favorable net impact on our operating expenses. We estimate that total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023
would have been approximately €102 million higher if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for 2022.

Finance income
         Finance income consists of fair value adjustment gains on certain financial instruments, interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and
short term investments, and foreign currency gains.
                                                                       Year ended December 31,                                            Change

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, finance income decreased by €260 million. The decrease was due primarily to €159
million of fair value movements in 2022 as a result of the decline in the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes while there was no such gain in 2023. There was
also a decrease of €117 million in foreign exchange gains on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in a transaction currency other than the
functional currency and a decrease of €66 million in fair value movements on warrants. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest income
of €84 million.

Finance costs
        Finance costs consist of fair value adjustment losses on financial instruments, interest expense, transaction costs on the issuance of the Exchangeable
Notes and foreign currency losses.
                                                                       Year ended December 31,                                            Change

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, finance costs increased by €88 million. The increase was due primarily to an increase of
€83 million attributable to an increase in the fair value of Exchangeable Notes.

Income tax expense
                                                                       Year ended December 31,                                            Change

         For the year ended December 31, 2023, income tax expense was €27 million, as compared to income tax expense of €60 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The decrease of €33 million was primarily due to a reduction in tax expense resulting from changes in estimates of €20 million and a
reduction in tax expense resulting from the impact of the utilization of historical share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity to offset current
taxable income of €13 million.



                                                                                50

B. Liquidity and Capital Resources
          Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operating activities. Cash and
cash equivalents and short term investments consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in government
securities, corporate debt securities, and collateralized reverse purchase agreements. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by
€864 million from €3,350 million as of December 31, 2022 to €4,214 million as of December 31, 2023.
             We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and the cash flow we generate from our operations will be sufficient to
meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital
requirements may be materially different than those currently planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our
rate of revenue growth, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, the acquisition of other companies, competitive factors,
and global economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and
requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our
shareholders, while the incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce covenants that might
restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Our Operations—We may require additional capital to support business growth and objectives, and this capital might not be available on acceptable
terms, if at all.”
             We continue to evaluate our real estate footprint to optimize our global office space while making necessary investments in offices and information
technology infrastructure to grow our business. We fund these investments using current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow we generate from
operations. Given the impact of our Work From Anywhere program and in conjunction with a strategic review of our real estate footprint and space utilization
trends, our focus has shifted more towards optimizing our current portfolio and reviewing our real estate needs around the world as opposed to significant
expansion of our presence in current markets. This will result in a reduction of our real estate footprint as we have decided to sublease certain leased office
space. See Note 3 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

Share repurchase program
         On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s
ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares were authorized at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders on
April 21, 2021. The repurchase program will expire on April 21, 2026. Since the commencement of this repurchase program and through December 31, 2023,
the Company has repurchased 469,274 shares for €91 million under this program.
          The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and
alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program is executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to
grow the business over the long term. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares, and the
repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company uses current cash and cash equivalents and the
cash flow it generates from operations to fund the share repurchase program.
         The authorization of the previous share repurchase program, announced on November 5, 2018, expired on April 21, 2021. The total aggregate amount
of repurchased shares under that program was 4,366,427 for a total of approximately $572 million.

Exchangeable Notes
         On March 2, 2021, Spotify USA Inc. issued US $1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. Net proceeds from the
issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting transaction costs. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this report for further information regarding our Exchangeable Notes.

          For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, net cash flows from operating activities increased by €634 million. The increase was
due primarily to a decrease of €278 million in operating loss adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation
expense. Additionally, there were favorable changes in working capital movements of €273 million, principally trade and other liabilities and deferred revenue,
partially offset by unfavorable changes in trade receivables and other assets.
         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by €206 million. The decrease was
due primarily to cash consideration used in business combinations, net of cash acquired, of €295 million during 2022, whereas no such activity occurred during
2023. There was also a decrease in capital expenditures of €19 million. These changes were partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows from purchases
and sales and maturities of short term investments of €122 million.
         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, net cash flows from/(used in) financing activities changed by €274 million. The change
from €40 million of net cash flows used in financing activities in 2022 to €234 million in net cash flows from financing activities in 2023 was due primarily to
an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of €323 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in payments for employee taxes
withheld from restricted stock units of €28 million and an increase in payments of lease liabilities of €23 million.

         Free Cash Flow:
         We define “Free Cash Flow” as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in restricted cash. Based on our
definition, our Free Cash Flow is summarized as follows:
                                                                                                                         Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                         2023                     2022               2021
                                                                                                                              (in € millions)
Net cash flows from operating activities                                                                         680                         46              361
Capital expenditures                                                                                              (6)                       (25)             (85)
Change in restricted cash                                                                                          4                         —                 1
Free Cash Flow                                                                                                   678                         21              277

         We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities
and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash
flows from operating activities.
         Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance. Because Free Cash
Flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. You should not consider Free Cash Flow in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported on our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
         For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, Free Cash Flow increased by €657 million. The increase in Free Cash Flow was due
primarily to an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of €634 million, as described above.

Indebtedness
         As of December 31, 2023, our outstanding indebtedness, other than lease liabilities, consisted primarily of the Exchangeable Notes that mature on
March 15, 2026 and bear no interest. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information regarding
our Exchangeable Notes. We may from time to time seek to incur additional indebtedness. Such indebtedness, if any, will depend on prevailing market
conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.

C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses
        For a detailed analysis of research and development policies and costs, see “Item 4.B. Business Overview” and discussions elsewhere in this “Item 5.
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.”


D. Trend Information
         Our results reflect the effects of our trial programs, both discounted and free trials, in addition to seasonal trends in user behavior and, with respect to
our Ad-Supported segment, advertising behavior. Historically, Premium Subscriber growth accelerates when we run such trial programs. Historically, we have
run two programs per year during the second and fourth quarters. During both 2022 and 2023, we launched a total of three programs in each year which were
run during the second, third, and fourth quarters.
         For our Ad-Supported segment, typically we experience higher advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater
advertising demand during the holiday season. However, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we typically experience a seasonal decline in advertising
revenue due to reduced advertiser demand.
         Other than as disclosed here and elsewhere in this report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments, or events since
December 31, 2023 that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our revenues, income, profitability, liquidity, or capital resources, or that would cause
the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions.


E. Critical Accounting Estimates
         We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Preparing these financial statements requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our
estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
         The critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe to have the most significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements are described below.


Revenue Recognition
Premium Revenue



                                                                                                    53
Table of Contents



          We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of subscriptions to the Premium Service. The Premium Service is primarily sold
directly to end users. The Premium Service is also sold through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with
their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end customers. Typically, the Premium Service is paid for on a monthly basis
in advance. We satisfy our performance obligation to provide Premium streaming services, and revenue from these services is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the subscription period.
         We sometimes bundle the Premium Service with other services and products. Additionally, in certain markets the specified monthly allocation of
audiobook access within the Premium Service is considered to be a separate performance obligation to the customer. In arrangements where we have multiple
performance obligations to the customer, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price. We
generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers; but where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable,
estimation techniques are used. In the markets where we offer audiobook listening time as part of the Premium subscription, we satisfy our performance
obligation to provide a monthly entitlement to specified hours of audiobook content as these hours are consumed and recognize revenue over time using an
output method based on the proportion of hours consumed. Additionally, we estimate how many hours of audiobook content will not be used by eligible
Premium Subscribers and recognize the revenue attributable to the unexercised rights in proportion to the pattern of audiobook consumption. For other bundles,
revenue is recognized either on a straight-line basis over the subscription period or at a point in time when control of the service or product is transferred to the
customer.
         Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. Under these arrangements, a premium
partner may bundle the Premium Service with its existing product offerings or offer the Premium Service as an add-on. Payment is remitted to the Group
through the premium partner. The Group assesses the facts and circumstances, including whether the partner is acting as a principal or agent, of all partner
revenue arrangements and then recognizes revenues as either gross or net. Premium partner services, whether recognized as gross or net, have one material
performance obligation, that being the delivery of the Premium Service.

Ad-Supported Revenue
          We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising
impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on behalf of their
clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-thousand basis
and are evidenced by an Insertion Order. Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal self-
serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis.
          Revenue from our Ad-Supported segment is dependent primarily on the number and hours of engagement of our Ad-Supported Users and podcast
listeners and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to those users and enhance returns for our advertising partners. Revenue is
recognized based on the number of impressions delivered.

Share-based Compensation
       Our employees and members of our board of directors receive remuneration in the form of share-based compensation transactions, whereby
employees render services in consideration for equity instruments.
         The fair value of a stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of an RSU or restricted
stock award is measured using the fair value of our ordinary shares on the date of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized, net of forfeitures,
over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally less than five years.
         Our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected term of the option,
expected volatility of the price of our ordinary shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our ordinary shares. The assumptions used in
our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s
judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
          We also must estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of
our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee
turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative
effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. A higher revised forfeiture rate than previously estimated will result in
an adjustment that will decrease the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of



                                                                                 54
Table of Contents



operations. A lower revised forfeiture rate than previously estimated will result in an adjustment that will increase the stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
         We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we accumulate
additional data related to our ordinary shares, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation
expense.
         Social costs are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation. Social costs in connection with
granted options and RSUs are accrued over the vesting period based on the intrinsic value of the award that has been earned at the end of each reporting period.
The amount of the liability reflects the amortization of the award and the impact of expected forfeitures. The social cost rate at which the accrual is made
generally follows the tax domicile within which other compensation charges for a grantee are recognized.

Content
          We incur royalty costs for the right to stream content to our users, paid to record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders. Royalties are
calculated using negotiated rates in accordance with license agreements, estimates of those rates in instances where rights holders are not identified, or rates as
determined by government bodies. Calculations are based on either Premium and Ad-Supported revenue earned or user/usage measures or a combination of
these. The rights holder agreements are complex and our determination of royalties payable involves certain significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates
in addition to complex systems and a significant volume of data to be processed and analyzed. In particular, in certain jurisdictions rights holders have several
years to claim royalties for works streamed each month. As such, the royalty costs incurred in a period might not be fully settled for a number of years and are
estimated. The estimate of royalty costs requires us to make assumptions about the rates to be recorded for streams where the rights holder is not identified and
the potential incidence of duplicate claims. These estimates are subject to revision until settlement. Considering the number of variables impacting the amounts
owed, the actual outcome could be different than our estimates, resulting in an additional accrual or release of previously recorded liabilities.
        Some rights holders have allowed the use of their content on our platform while negotiations of the terms and conditions of individual agreements or
determination of statutory rates are ongoing. In these instances, royalties are calculated based on our best estimate of the eventual payout.
         In 2022, the proceedings known as “Phonorecords IV Proceedings” began to set the rates for the Section 115 blanket license for calendar years 2023
to 2027. In August 2022, we and other service providers reached an agreement in principle with publisher organizations for these rates and terms and asked the
Copyright Royalty Board to adopt those rates and terms on an industry-wide basis. In December 2022, the Copyright Royalty Board issued final regulations
adopting the parties' proposed rates and terms on an industry-wide basis for the Phonorecords IV period.
        Many of the rights holders agreements include the right to audit our royalty payments, and any such audit could result in disputes over whether we
have paid the proper royalties. Given the complexity of the arrangements, if such a dispute were to occur, we could be required to pay additional royalties, and
the amounts involved could be material.
           The majority of our rights holder liabilities are settled on commercial payment terms shortly after they are incurred. However, certain of these
liabilities are not settled for more significant periods of time due to uncertainties related to the reasons discussed above. Of the total accruals and provisions to
rights holders at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately €455 million and €441 million, respectively, relate to liabilities that were incurred
more than 12 months prior to the date of the statement of financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the estimates at December 31, 2022 were
revised down resulting in adjustments to the consolidated statement of operations totaling €36 million.
          We have certain arrangements whereby royalty costs are paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. These minimum guarantee
amounts have been disclosed in Note 25 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. An accrual is established when actual
royalty costs to be incurred during a contractual period are expected to fall short of the minimum guaranteed amounts. For minimum guarantee arrangements
for which we cannot reliably predict the underlying expense, we will expense the minimum guarantee on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.
We also have certain royalty arrangements where we would have to make additional payments if the royalty rates for specified periods were below those paid
to certain other licensors (most favored nation clauses). For rights holders with this clause, we compare royalties incurred to date plus estimated royalties
payable for the remainder of the period to estimates of the royalties payable to other appropriate rights holders, and the shortfall, if any, is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the period of the applicable most favored nation clause. An accrual and expense is recognized when it is probable that we will make
additional royalty payments under these terms. The expense related to these accruals is recognized in cost of revenue.
         Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded in cost of revenue over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period, and
begins at the release of each episode. The economic life and expected amortization profile of



                                                                                 55
Table of Contents



podcast content assets is estimated by management based on historical listening patterns and is evaluated on an ongoing basis. Determining these estimates
requires significant judgment by management.

Provisions
          From time to time, we are involved in legal actions or other third-party assertions related to content on our platform. There can be no assurance these
actions or other third-party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation in a manner that does not adversely impact our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows, or without requiring higher royalty payments in the future, which may adversely impact gross margins. We record a liability when it
is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In determining the probability of a loss and consequently determining a
reasonable estimate, management is required to use significant judgment. Given the uncertainties associated with any litigation, the actual outcome can be
different from our estimates and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—Our royalty payment scheme is complex, and it is difficult to estimate the amount payable under our
license agreements or relevant statutes.”

Exchangeable Notes
          Our Exchangeable Notes are re-measured at each reporting date using valuation models using input data. They are accounted for in their entirety at
fair value, with any change in fair value after initial measurement being recorded in finance income or cost in the consolidated statement of operations, except
that changes in fair value that are due to changes in own credit risk will be presented separately in other comprehensive income/(loss) and will not be
reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes is estimated using a combination of a binomial option pricing
model and prices observed for the Exchangeable Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period. Our ordinary share price is
a primary driver of the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our finance (costs)/income could be
materially different in the future. Please refer to “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included elsewhere in this report for
additional information on the share price risk related to our Exchangeable Notes.
       See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on the valuation models used for our
Exchangeable Notes.

Warrants
         We issued certain non-compensatory warrants in the Company to a holder that is an employee and a member of management of the Group pursuant to
a subscription agreement. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—E. Share Ownership—Warrants." Our warrants are re-measured at each
reporting date using valuation models using input data. The change in fair value of these financial liabilities are recognized in finance income or cost in the
consolidated statement of operations. Our ordinary share price is a primary driver of the fair value of the warrants. If factors change and different assumptions
are used, our finance (costs)/income could be materially different in the future. Please refer to “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk” included elsewhere in this report for additional information on the share price risk related to our warrants.
         See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on the valuation models used for our
warrants.

Income Taxes
        We are subject to income taxes in Luxembourg, Sweden, the United States, and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our uncertain tax positions. The group measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which
method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.
         Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available, against which they can be used. Unused tax loss carry-forwards are reviewed at each reporting date and are not recorded
when, in management's assessment, it is not probable that we will generate future taxable income to utilize the loss carry-forwards.
          In determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, we take into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes,
interest, or penalties may be due. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the
final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax
audit, new information presented by a tax authority, or changes in tax legislation. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different



                                                                               56
Table of Contents



than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a
material impact on our financial condition and operating results.
           We have initiated and are in negotiations of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") between Sweden and the United States governments for tax years
including 2014 through 2020 covering various transfer pricing matters. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by
various tax authorities which could result in assessments against us. There are currently ongoing tax audits in several jurisdictions, and most of these audits
involve transfer pricing issues. Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions have challenged our tax positions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits,
taking into account any new information available, in order to determine the appropriateness of the tax reserves recorded on the balance sheet. If we conclude
that it is not probable that our tax position will be accepted, the effect of that uncertainty is reflected at either the most likely amount or the expected value,
taking into account a range of possible outcomes. The resolution of tax examinations and the APA may be significant to the consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations
         In business combinations, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets
acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identified assets and liabilities
is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, especially with respect to intangible
assets.

Lease Agreements
          As most of our lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate of return, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at
the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined based on estimates and
judgments, including the credit rating of our leasing entities and a credit spread.

Impairment of real estate assets
         In connection with the Office Space Optimization Initiative, we have recognized non-cash impairment charges to write-down the related real estate
assets, which included lease right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements and property and equipment, to their recoverable amounts. To determine the
recoverable amounts of these real estate assets, we utilized discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value less cost of disposal. The development of
discounted cash flow models required the application of level 3 inputs and significant judgment in determining market participant assumptions, including the
projected sublease income over the remaining lease terms, expected vacancy periods prior to the commencement of future subleases, expected lease incentives
offered to future tenants, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with these future cash flows. Management's estimates of recoverable
amounts are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ
from estimates. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

Goodwill Impairment
         In accordance with the accounting policy described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we annually
perform an impairment test regarding goodwill. The assumptions used for estimating fair value and assessing available headroom based on conditions that
existed at the testing date are disclosed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
         See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently
issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the dates of the statement of financial position included in this report.

B. Compensation
         This section discusses the principles underlying the material components of our executive compensation program for a subset of our executive
leadership team who would be our named executive officers, if we were a domestic issuer, and the factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and
decisions. These “named executive officers” for 2023 are:
    •    Daniel Ek, who is our Founder and serves as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chairman, and Director and is our principal executive officer;
    •    Paul Vogel, who will serve as our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and our principal financial officer until March 31, 2024;
    •    Dustee Jenkins, who serves as our Chief Public Affairs Officer;
    •    Alex Norström, who serves as our Co-President, Chief Business Officer; and
    •    Gustav Söderström, who serves as our Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer.
         Specifically, this section provides an overview of our executive compensation philosophy, the overall objectives of our executive compensation
program, and each compensation component that we provide. In addition, we explain how and why the people experience and compensation committee of our
board of directors arrived at specific compensation policies and decisions involving our named executive officers during 2023.
          Each of the key elements of our executive compensation program is discussed in more detail below. Our compensation programs are designed to be
flexible and complementary and to collectively serve their principles and objectives.

Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
         We operate in the highly competitive and dynamic digital media industry as the world’s most popular global audio streaming subscription service. This
industry is characterized by rapidly changing market requirements and the emergence of new competitors. To succeed in this environment, we must
continuously develop solutions that meet the needs of our rapidly growing user base in a rapidly changing environment, efficiently develop and refine new and
existing products and services, and demonstrate a strong return on investment to our advertisers. To achieve these objectives, we need a highly talented and
seasoned team of data scientists, engineers, product designers, product managers, and other business professionals.
         We recognize that our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees,
which is driven by our compensation, culture and reputation, and the strength of our brand. We strive to create an environment that is responsive to the needs of
our employees, is open towards employee communication and continual performance feedback, encourages teamwork, and rewards commitment and
performance. The principles and objectives of our compensation and benefits programs for our executive leadership team and other employees are to:
    •    attract, engage, and retain the best executives to work for us, with experience and managerial talent enabling us to be an employer of choice in highly
         competitive and dynamic industries;
    •    align compensation with our corporate strategies, business and financial objectives, and the long-term interests of our shareholders;
    •    motivate and reward executives whose knowledge, skills, and performance ensure our continued success; and
    •    ensure that our total compensation is fair, reasonable, and competitive.



                                                                                61
Table of Contents



        We compete with many other companies in seeking to attract and retain experienced and skilled executives. To meet this challenge, we have embraced
a compensation philosophy that offers our executive leadership team competitive compensation and benefits packages including equity grants, which are
focused on long-term value creation, and that rewards our executive leadership team for achieving our financial and strategic objectives.


Roles of Our Board of Directors, People Experience and Compensation Committee, and Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions
         The initial compensation arrangements with our executive leadership team, including the named executive officers, have been determined in arms-
length negotiations with each individual executive. Typically, our CEO has been responsible for negotiating these arrangements, except with respect to his own
compensation, with the oversight and final approval of the members of our board of directors or the people experience and compensation committee. The
compensation arrangements have been influenced by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
    •    our financial condition and available resources;
    •    our need for that particular position to be filled;
    •    our board of directors’ evaluation of the competitive market based on the third-party data provided by Compensia, Inc. (“Compensia”), a
         compensation consulting firm, competitive pay practices for comparable positions at companies of comparable scale and in relevant business
         segments, as further described below, and the experience of the members of the people experience and compensation committee with other companies;
    •    the length of service of an individual; and
    •    the compensation levels of other members of the executive leadership team, each as of the time of the applicable compensation decision.
         Following the establishment of the initial compensation arrangements, our CEO, board of directors, and people experience and compensation
committee have been responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program, as well as determining and approving the ongoing compensation
arrangements for our CEO and other members of the executive leadership team, including the other named executive officers. Typically, our CEO reviews the
performance of the other members of the executive leadership team, including the other named executive officers, and based on this review, along with the
factors described above, makes recommendations to the people experience and compensation committee with respect to the total compensation, including each
individual component of compensation, of these individuals for the coming year. There is no predetermined time of year for these reviews, although they are
generally performed on an annual basis coinciding with our Company-wide employee compensation review in March. Further, the people experience and
compensation committee reviews the performance of our CEO, and based on this review and the factors described above, recommends his total compensation
to our board of directors for approval. Since July 1, 2017, our CEO has not been awarded any compensation, but from time to time he has been provided with
the opportunity to purchase non-compensatory warrants at fair market value through D.G.E. Investments, an entity indirectly wholly owned by him , as
described below in “Warrants.”
         The current compensation levels of our executive leadership team, including the named executive officers, primarily reflect the varying roles and
responsibilities of each individual.

Engagement of Compensation Consultant
        The people experience and compensation committee has engaged the services of Compensia to provide executive compensation advisory services. The
people experience and compensation committee directed Compensia to develop a peer group of comparable companies in our sector and prepare a competitive
market analysis of our executive compensation program to assist it in determining the appropriate level of overall compensation, as well as assess each separate
component of compensation, with the goal of understanding the competitiveness of the compensation we offer to our executive leadership team. In 2022, the
people experience and compensation committee approved the compensation peer group (the “Peer Group”) for fiscal year 2023.
         The Peer Group for 2023 consisted of the following companies:

Activision Blizzard                         Autodesk                         Block                                        Booking Holdings
eBay                                        Electronic Arts                  Expedia Group                                IAC/InterActiveCorp
Intuit                                      MercadoLibre                     Netflix                                      PayPal Holdings
Sirius XM Holdings                          Snap                             Take-Two Interactive                         Twitter
Uber Technologies                           Warner Bros. Discovery           Zalando



                                                                              62
Table of Contents



          The people experience and compensation committee bases its executive compensation decisions, at least in part, by reference to the compensation of
the executives holding comparable positions at this group of comparable peer companies, as it may be adjusted from time to time. In 2023, Compensia
provided the people experience and compensation committee with total cash compensation data and total compensation data (including cash compensation and
equity compensation) at various percentiles within the Peer Group. The people experience and compensation committee considered this data in determining the
compensation levels of our named executive officers, but we did not benchmark our executive compensation to any pre-determined target percentile of market.
The people experience and compensation committee sought to compensate our named executive officers at a level that would allow us to successfully recruit
and retain the best possible talent for our executive leadership team. Overall, Compensia’s analysis of our Peer Group indicated that the target total cash
compensation for our named executive officers was approximately the 25th percentile of our Peer Group. Our total compensation for our named executive
officers other than our CEO (who, as we note below, did not receive any cash or equity compensation in 2023), including cash and equity compensation, was
between the 50th and 75th percentile of our Peer Group. As discussed below, we rely heavily on our equity awards to incentivize our employees, including each
of our named executive officers.

Compensation Philosophy
       We design the principal components of our executive compensation program to fulfill one or more of the principles and objectives described above.
Compensation of our named executive officers consists of the following elements:
    •    base salary;
    •    incentive compensation;
    •    certain severance benefits;
    •    retirement savings plans; and
    •    health and welfare benefits and certain limited perquisites and other personal benefits.
         We offer cash compensation in the form of base salaries that we believe appropriately reward our executive leadership team members for their
individual contributions to our business. We have opted not to offer annual cash bonuses to our executive leadership team members, as we believe they do not
incentivize the long-term growth of the Company. In 2023, part of our executive compensation was granted in the form of one-time cash retention bonuses.
These were intended to retain and further incentivize certain of our employees, including our executive leadership team members, as discussed further below.
         We offer equity awards as part of an incentive mix program to incentivize our executive leadership team to focus on the growth of our overall
enterprise value and, correspondingly, the creation of value for our shareholders. As a result of this compensation practice, a greater percentage of each
executive leadership team member’s total compensation has been tied to shareholder returns, with cash compensation kept at modest levels, which provides an
opportunity to be well-rewarded through equity if we perform well over time.
       Except as described below, we have not adopted any policy or guidelines for allocating compensation between currently-paid and long-term
compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among different forms of non-cash compensation.
        Each of the primary elements of our executive compensation program is discussed in more detail below. We believe that, as a part of our overall
executive compensation policy, each individual element serves our objectives described above.

Executive Compensation Program Components
        The following describes the primary components of our executive compensation program for each of our named executive officers, the rationale for
that component, and how compensation amounts are determined.

Base Salary and Bonus
         Generally, each named executive officer’s initial base salary was established through arms-length negotiation at the time the individual was hired,
taking into account his or her qualifications, experience, and prior salary level. Thereafter, the base salaries of the named executive officers are reviewed
periodically by our people experience and compensation committee, and adjustments are made as deemed appropriate.
        Since July 1, 2017, our CEO has not received a base salary; however, the people experience and compensation committee may, from time to time,
provide Mr. Ek with a discretionary bonus as it determines to be appropriate. Mr. Ek did not receive a bonus for 2021, 2022 or 2023.



                                                                                63

One-Year Retention Plan
          On March 1, 2023, each of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Ek) was granted a cash retention bonus in the amount set forth below:
Named Executive Officer                                                                                                                                               Retention Bonus ($)

         The retention bonuses will vest in full on the 12-month anniversary of the grant date (i.e., March 1, 2024), subject to the executive’s continued full-
time employment (and the executive not providing or receiving notice of termination of employment) through such vesting date. Any vested retention bonus
will be paid in the pay period following the vesting date. If the executive’s employment is terminated by us for any reason other than for “cause” (as defined in
the applicable agreement) prior to the vesting date, the executive will be entitled to a prorated portion of the bonus, calculated based on the date on which the
notice of termination was given (for Ms. Jenkins) or the date occurring six months following such date (for Messrs. Norström, Söderström, and Vogel).
Additionally, if in connection with or within six months following a change in control, Mr. Norström, Söderström, or Vogel (i) resigns because he is required to
perform duties that are materially inconsistent with those normally performed by someone in his position or (ii) otherwise experiences a constructive
termination, the executive’s bonus will accelerate and vest in full.

Long-Term Incentives
          Each of our named executive officers has been granted equity awards in the Company, which allow them to share in the future appreciation of the
Company, subject to certain vesting conditions, as described in more detail below. These equity awards are designed to foster a long-term commitment to us by
our named executive officers, provide a balance to the salary component of our compensation program, align a portion of our executives’ compensation to the
interests of our shareholders, promote retention, and reinforce our pay-for-performance structure (as discussed in more detail below).
          Long-term incentive awards are provided upon hire as well as during employment at the Company’s discretion.
        We maintain an incentive mix program, which is intended to provide our named executive officers as well as all other permanent employees with
maximum flexibility and individual autonomy, by allowing our employees to have the ability to choose their own composition of long-term incentive
awards. Employees are informed of their intended aggregate dollar amount of long-term incentive compensation, and they can allocate such dollar amount
among at-the-money stock options, out-of-the-money stock options with a closing price equal to 150% of the closing price per ordinary share on the grant date,
RSUs, or cash. Employees can choose to have one or two types of equity awards and/or cash and can mix their programs in portions of 25%, 50%, and
75%. Each type of long-term incentive award vests on the same schedule: 3/48ths of the equity award and/or cash payment vests on the third calendar month
following the date of grant, and thereafter 1/48th of the equity award and/or cash payment vests on the first day of each calendar month.



                                                                                            64
Table of Contents



        For 2023 compensation, the amount of any cash award chosen was equal to 100% of the dollar amount the employee allocated to cash; the number of
RSUs provided was equal to the dollar amount the employee allocated to RSUs divided by the closing price per ordinary share on the grant date; the number of
at-the-money options provided was equal to three times the dollar amount the employee allocated to such stock options divided by such closing price; and the
number of out-of-the-money stock options provided was equal to six times the dollar amount the employee allocated to stock options divided by such closing
price.
         For further information on our equity award programs, please see “—Stock Options,” “—Restricted Stock Units” and “—Cash Program” below.
        In 2023, each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Ek, participated in the incentive mix program. The following table shows the dollar
amount of incentive compensation awarded to each named executive officer, as well as the allocations chosen by each such individual:

Long-Term Incentive Award Decisions
          Each year our people experience and compensation committee reviews and, if needed, recommends updates to our current equity program to our
board of directors for approval in order to incentivize our employees, including our named executive officers. Our people experience and compensation
committee, in consultation with our CEO, determines the aggregate dollar value of the long-term incentive compensation to be awarded to each executive
leadership team member. In making these decisions, the people experience and compensation committee takes into consideration the Company’s financial
results and market conditions, as well as the factors described above.

Retirement Savings and Other Benefits
          Our retirement programs are designed to comply with local laws and regulations. For our employees who reside in Sweden, including Mr. Söderström
(and, for a portion of 2023, Mr. Norström), we participate in an occupational pension plan. Pursuant to such plan we pay a premium of 4.5% of each such
employee’s monthly base salary up to an annual income ceiling and 30% of monthly base salary on amounts above such annual income ceiling. Employees also
may contribute additional amounts through a salary exchange program pursuant to which eligible employees are given the opportunity to enhance their pension
savings by choosing to exchange a portion of their base salary for additional pension contributions. Certain legal limitations apply to the amount of
contributions that may be made to the occupational pension plan. During the portion of 2023 during which Mr. Norström resided in the U.K., Mr. Norström
was not eligible to participate in the Swedish occupational pension plan, and he did not elect to participate in our pension plan for U.K.-based employees
during this period.
         For our employees in the United States who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including Mr. Vogel and Ms. Jenkins, we have established a 401(k)
retirement savings plan. Under the 401(k) plan, eligible employees may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the prescribed annual limit and
contribute these amounts to the 401(k) plan. The Company matches up to 50% of the employee’s contributions up to 6% of their eligible compensation.
Employees vest in the employer contributions ratably over one year.

         The Company does not maintain any defined benefit plans for any of its named executive officers.

Employee Benefits and Perquisites
         Additional benefits received by our employees who reside in Sweden, including Messrs. Ek and Söderström (and, for a portion of 2023, Mr.
Norström), include private healthcare, accident insurance, life and long-term disability insurance, travel insurance, and parental leave. Additional benefits
received by our U.S. employees, including Mr. Vogel and Ms. Jenkins, include medical, dental, and vision benefits, medical, and dependent care flexible
spending accounts, short-term and long-term disability insurance, basic life insurance coverage, and parental leave. Additional benefits received by our
employees who



                                                                                  65
Table of Contents



reside in the U.K., including, for a portion of 2023, Mr. Norström, include medical and dental benefits, life and long-term disability insurance, and parental
leave. These benefits are provided to our named executive officers on the same general terms as they are provided to all of our full-time employees in the
applicable countries.
         We design our employee benefits programs to be affordable and competitive in relation to the market, as well as compliant with applicable laws and
practices. We adjust our employee benefits programs as needed based upon regular monitoring of applicable laws and practices in the competitive market.
         We do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program. We generally provide
relocation assistance to all of our employees, when applicable. In addition, the personal safety of our employees, including our named executive officers, is of
the highest importance to us and in 2023 we paid for personal security services for certain named executive officers pursuant to the Company's personal
security program for senior management. Although we consider these personal security services to be appropriate and necessary for the reasons described
above, the costs related to such services are reported as other compensation to our named executive officers in the “2023 Summary Compensation Table”
below. In the future, we may provide other perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as where we believe it is appropriate to assist an
individual executive officer in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive leadership team members more efficient and effective, and for
recruitment, motivation, or retention purposes. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits for our named executive officers will be
approved and subject to periodic review by the people experience and compensation committee. We do not expect these perquisites to be a significant
component of our compensation program.

Severance
      Each of our named executive officers is entitled to severance upon certain qualifying terminations. For further information on such amounts please see
“—Employment Agreements” below.

Executive Transition
        As previously announced, Mr. Vogel, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, will cease employment with the Company on March 31, 2024. In
connection with his departure, Mr. Vogel is entitled to receive severance consistent with the terms of his employment agreement with the Company.

Employment Agreements
        We have, or one of our subsidiaries has, entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Ek, Norström, Söderström, and Vogel, and Ms. Jenkins.
We currently do not have employment agreements or other service contracts with any members of our board of directors, except for Mr. Ek.
         Mr. Ek’s employment agreement provides for an indefinite term that automatically expires upon Mr. Ek’s retirement, which shall be at age of 65, and a
fixed monthly salary (although the board of directors determined that, commencing July 1, 2017, Mr. Ek would no longer receive an annual salary). The
employment agreement further entitles Mr. Ek to a six-month notice period prior to termination, other than in connection with his retirement, provided that we
may terminate the agreement with immediate effect if Mr. Ek has grossly neglected his obligations or otherwise materially breached the contract. In the event
of termination of employment by us (other than due to gross neglect), in addition to pay during the notice period, Mr. Ek is also entitled to a severance payment
equal to six times his monthly salary, less any income from future employment, payable in monthly installments following termination. Using Mr. Ek’s current
base salary, he would be entitled to no payments under this arrangement. Mr. Ek would not be entitled to a notice period or severance upon his retirement.
          Mr. Ek’s employment agreement contains post-termination non-competition covenants that we could choose to enforce for 12 months following any
type of termination of employment, except termination by us due to any reason other than breach of contract by Mr. Ek. In consideration for the non-
competition covenant, we would be required to pay Mr. Ek, in monthly installments during his restricted period, 12 times his monthly salary, less any income
from future employment up to 60% of Mr. Ek’s monthly salary. Using Mr. Ek’s current base salary, he would be entitled to no payments under this
arrangement. Such payment will not be made during any period Mr. Ek is otherwise receiving severance pay from us or if Mr. Ek’s employment ceases as a
result of retirement or termination by us due to Mr. Ek’s breach of contract. If we decide not to enforce the non-competition covenant, the corresponding
payment obligation would also cease. Mr. Ek’s employment agreement also includes employee and customer non-solicitation clauses that will apply for 12
months post-termination and that do not require us to pay any additional consideration.
         Our employment agreements with Messrs. Norström, Söderström, and Vogel, and Ms. Jenkins provide for an indefinite employment period, a base
salary and participation in our benefit programs and long-term incentive compensation plans. The agreements entitle Messrs. Norström, Söderström, and Vogel,
and Ms. Jenkins to a three-month notice period prior to termination, provided that we may terminate the agreement with immediate effect in connection with a
termination for



                                                                                66
Table of Contents



“Cause” (as defined in the relevant agreement). In addition, upon a termination without Cause, subject to the named executive officer’s execution and non-
revocation of a release of claims, Messrs. Norström, Söderström, and Vogel, and Ms. Jenkins would each be entitled to a severance amount equal to the
executive’s respective base salary for six months (or, for Ms. Jenkins, three months) and subsidized health benefits for six months (or, for Ms. Jenkins, three
months). If we terminate Messrs. Norström, Söderström, or Vogel, or Ms. Jenkins at any time during the three-month notice period, Messrs. Norström,
Söderström, and Vogel, and Ms. Jenkins will also be entitled to pay in lieu of notice through the end of the notice period, subject to compliance with certain
restrictive covenants. If Mr. Norström’s, Söderström’s, or Vogel’s employment is terminated within 12 months after a change in control of the Company, if Mr.
Norström, Söderström or Vogel is required to perform duties that are materially inconsistent with those normally performed by the executive, or if the executive
is otherwise constructively dismissed following the change in control, subject to the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims, the named executive officer would be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment of 12 months’ salary and subsidized health benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Messrs. Norström, Söderström, and Vogel will not be entitled to the change in control severance described above, and Ms.
Jenkins will not be entitled to the severance described above, in the event of certain asset sales where the executive continues his or her employment in the
same or greater capacity following the transaction or the executive is offered continued employment in connection with the transaction and the executive’s
employment agreement is assumed by the surviving entity following the transaction. Messrs. Norström, Söderström, and Vogel, and Ms. Jenkins are also
subject to a nine-month (or, for Ms. Jenkins, six-month) post-termination non-competition covenant (with such period commencing on the first day of the
notice period, or, for Ms. Jenkins, the termination date) and a two-year post-termination employee and customer non-solicitation covenant.
          Additionally, in July 2023, we entered into a transfer letter and U.K. employment contract with Mr. Norström in connection with his temporary
transfer from Sweden to the U.K., which provides for (i) a fixed term of employment at Spotify Ltd from August 21, 2023 to August 18, 2024, (ii) continued
vesting of Mr. Norström’s equity awards in accordance with their terms during such period, and (iii) substantially the same terms as described for Mr. Norström
above, except that Mr. Norström is not entitled to subsidized health benefits upon the qualifying terminations described above.
         For further information on the post-termination treatment of our equity awards, please see “—Stock Options” and “—Restricted Stock Units” below.

Clawback Policy
         In 2023, we adopted a Clawback Policy in compliance with the SEC rules and New York Stock Exchange listing standards to recover any excess
incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers after an accounting restatement.


C. Board Practices

Board of Directors Structure
          Our board of directors currently consists of ten directors and is composed of Class A and Class B directors. Our articles of association provide that the
board of directors must be composed of at least three members. Each director holds office for the term decided by the general meeting of the shareholders or
until his or her successor has been appointed. For more information on the date of expiration of each director’s term and the length of time each director has
served, see “Item 6.A. Directors and Senior Management.” Our directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by a resolution of the

Stock Options
         As noted above, we have granted stock options to our named executive officers and other employees, including as part of the incentive mix program.
Each stock option represents the right to purchase one of our ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of an ordinary share on the
applicable grant date. The stock options generally vest as to 3/48ths of the total number of options granted on the third calendar month following the date of
grant, and as to 1/48th of the total number of options granted on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, subject to continued employment. The options
generally expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, and vested options may be exercised at any time prior to the expiration of the option term. For our
employees in certain countries, upon the exercise of a stock option, the Company is required to pay a social security contribution in an amount equal to the
spread value of the option multiplied by the applicable tax rate.
         Upon the termination of an optionee’s employment for any reason, all unvested options held by the optionee will generally be immediately forfeited.
However, for certain employees, including the named executive officers, upon termination of an optionee’s employment (i) by the Company for any reason
other than Cause or (ii) by the optionee due to the Company’s material breach of the optionee’s employment agreement, a portion of unvested options will
immediately vest. The portion of unvested options that will accelerate and vest ranges from six to twelve months’ worth of unvested options, depending on the
optionee. If the optionee resigns; if we terminate the optionee’s employment other than as a result of death, disability or “Cause” (as defined in the applicable
option plan); or if the optionee retires, the optionee’s vested options will remain exercisable for 90 days following such termination. If the optionee’s
termination of employment occurs due to death or disability, the vested options will remain exercisable for 194 days following termination. In either case, the
option will no longer be exercisable after the expiration date. Upon termination for Cause, vested options will immediately be forfeited. We also may cancel an
optionee’s options upon the optionee’s commission of a material breach of the terms and conditions governing the options.
          The board of directors may, among other things, provide for a new exercise period upon a change in control. If the board of directors sets a new
exercise period, 50% of each holder’s unvested options will accelerate and vest. Following such acceleration, the board of directors may choose to allow the
unvested options to continue to vest or lapse. If the board allows the unvested options to continue vesting, 3/96th of the unvested options will vest after the first
cliff vesting date as described above, and 1/96th of the remaining options will vest on each subsequent regularly scheduled vesting occasion. If we or our
successor terminates an optionee’s employment without Cause in connection with or within six months following a transaction constituting a change in control,
any unvested stock options held by the optionee will vest as of such termination. In addition, for certain employees, including the named executive officers, if
in connection with or within six months following a change in control, such employee (i) resigns because he or she is required to perform duties that are
materially inconsistent with the ones normally performed by someone in such position or (ii) otherwise experiences a constructive termination, any unvested
stock options held by the employee will vest as of such resignation. The plans provide for other potential adjustments to the stock options in the event of
corporate transactions.

Restricted Stock Units
        As noted above, we have granted RSUs to our named executive officers and other employees, including as part of the incentive mix program. Each
RSU represents the right to receive one of our ordinary shares. The RSUs generally vest as to 3/48ths of the total number of RSUs granted on the third calendar
month following the date of grant, and thereafter as to 1/48th of the total number of RSUs granted on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, subject to
continued employment.
          All unvested RSUs will generally be forfeited upon any termination of employment. However, for certain employees, including the named executive
officers, upon termination of an employee’s employment (i) by the Company for any reason other than Cause or (ii) by the employee due to the Company’s
material breach of the employee’s employment agreement, a portion of the individual’s unvested RSUs will immediately vest. The portion of unvested RSUs
that will accelerate and vest will be equal to the number of such RSUs that would have otherwise vested between six and 12 months following the termination,
depending on the employee. If we or our successor terminates the employee’s employment without Cause in connection with or within six months following a
transaction constituting a change in control, any unvested RSUs held by the individual will vest as of such termination. In addition, for certain employees,
including the named executive officers, if in connection with or within six months following a change in control, the individual (i) resigns because he or she is
required to perform duties that are materially inconsistent with the ones normally performed by someone in such position or (ii) otherwise experiences a
constructive termination, all of the individual’s outstanding unvested RSUs will accelerate and vest.



                                                                                               71

          For our employees in certain countries, upon vesting of an RSU, the Company is required to pay a social security contribution in an amount equal to
the profit an employee realizes upon vesting multiplied by the applicable tax rate. The RSUs are settled in ordinary shares on or as soon as reasonably
practicable (but no later than 30 days) following full vesting.
        The plans provide for other potential adjustments to the RSUs in the event of corporate transactions. If the holder commits a material breach of the
terms and conditions governing RSUs, we may cancel the unvested RSUs.

Cash Program
         As noted above, we also offer cash awards as part of our incentive mix program to all permanent employees, including our named executive officers.
Pursuant to the cash alternative of the incentive mix program, the named executive officers who choose to include cash in their incentive mix composition will
receive a fixed cash payment upon each vesting date. As noted above, for the cash awards granted in 2023, 3/48ths of the cash payment vested on the third
calendar month following the date of grant, and thereafter 1/48th of the cash payment granted vests on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, subject to
continued employment.

D.G.E. Investments may purchase the ordinary shares underlying the warrants for $190.09 per share at any time prior to July 1, 2022. On July 1, 2022, 800,000
warrants that were granted on July 1, 2019 expired unexercised.
        On August 23, 2021, Mr. Ek purchased, through D.G.E. Investments, 800,000 non-compensatory warrants in the Company, pursuant to a subscription

Investments may purchase the ordinary shares underlying the warrants for $281.63 per share at any time through August 23, 2024.
          The warrants are subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events.

Non-Employee Director Compensation
          Similarly to our executive compensation decisions, the people experience and compensation committee bases its decisions regarding non-employee
director compensation, at least in part, by reference to the compensation of the non-employee directors in the Peer Group (as described above in “—
Engagement of Compensation Consultant”). Our non-employee directors are also eligible to participate in our incentive mix program, which is intended to
provide our non-employee directors with maximum flexibility and individual autonomy, by allowing our non-employee directors to have the ability to choose
their own composition of long-term incentive awards each year. For further information on our incentive mix program, please see “—Long Term Incentives”
above. Each such grant generally vests ratably over four years. The non-employee director RSUs will fully vest upon the occurrence of a change in control.
Like employee RSUs, the RSUs are settled within 30 days following vesting, and unvested RSUs are forfeited on termination of service. The plans provide for
certain potential adjustments in the event of corporate transactions.
       Each year, our people experience and compensation committee reviews and, if needed, recommends updates regarding non-employee director
compensation to our board of directors. In addition, our equity program for our board of directors is subject to shareholder approval.
         In 2023, each of our non-employee directors participated in the incentive mix program. None of our non-employee
directors are party to a service contract with us that provides for any benefits upon termination of service. The following table shows the dollar amount of
incentive compensation allocated to each non-employee director, as well as the allocations chosen by each such individual:

(1)        Mr. Ek serves on our board of directors. His compensation is fully reflected in the Summary Compensation Table. Cristina Stenbeck served on our board of directors until March 29,
           2023 and Ms. Stenbeck did not receive any compensation for service as a director during 2023.
(2)        Amounts reflect the grant-date fair value of the RSUs granted computed in accordance with IFRS 2, rather than the amounts paid to or realized by the named individual. We provide
           information regarding the assumptions used to calculate the value of all stock awards made in “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and in Note 18 of the consolidated
           financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
(3)        Amounts reflect the aggregate grant-date Black-Scholes value of the stock options granted during 2023 computed in accordance IFRS 2, rather than the amounts paid to or realized by

Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.


A. Major Shareholders
          The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2023 (except where noted), the number of our ordinary shares and beneficiary certificates held by
each person we know to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our ordinary shares and beneficiary certificates, respectively, and the percentage of total
votes held by each such person. The voting rights of our major shareholders are the same as the voting rights of holders of our ordinary shares and beneficiary
certificates who are not our major shareholders. As of December 31, 2023, the registrar and transfer agent for our Company reported that 162,752,342 of our
ordinary shares were held by 422 record holders in the United States and none of our beneficiary certificates were held by record holders in the United States.
Our beneficiary certificates carry no economic rights and are issued to provide the holders of such beneficiary certificates additional voting rights; however,
each beneficiary certificate entitles its holder to one vote.



                                                                                              76
Table of Contents



         In accordance with the rules of the SEC, beneficial ownership includes voting or investment power with respect to securities and includes the ordinary
shares issuable pursuant to options, warrants, and RSUs that are exercisable or settled within 60 days of December 31, 2023. Ordinary shares issuable pursuant
to options, warrants, and RSUs are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the class beneficially owned by the person holding such options,
warrants, and RSUs but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the class beneficially owned by any other person. The percentage of
beneficial ownership for the following table is based on 197,143,389 total ordinary shares and 343,841,690 total beneficiary certificates outstanding as of
December 31, 2023.

B. Related Party Transactions
          Luxembourg law prescribes certain procedures for related party transactions with directors, and our articles of association mandate that directors with
a direct or indirect personal interest in any transaction that conflicts with the Company’s interest shall make that interest known and recorded in the board
minutes and shall not participate in discussing or voting on such transaction. In addition, our articles of association provide that any such conflict of interest
must be reported to the next general meeting of shareholders of the Company prior to any resolution taking place at such meeting.



                                                                                                   77

statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of the transactions relating to the warrants purchased by Mr. Ek.

Related Party Transaction Policy
         Our board of directors has adopted the Related Party Transaction Policy, which requires that any material transaction between us and any related party,
including our directors and senior management as well as their family members, be reviewed and approved by the audit committee to ensure that the
transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s length dealings with an unrelated third party.

Item 8. Financial Information


A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information
         Refer to “Item 18. Financial Statements” for our consolidated financial statements and report of our independent registered public accounting firm
included elsewhere in this document.

Legal or arbitration proceedings
        Refer to Notes 22 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information regarding provisions made for legal
proceedings.

Dividend Policy
          We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our share capital, and we do not expect to pay dividends or other distributions on our ordinary
shares in the foreseeable future. There are no legislative or other legal provisions currently in force in Luxembourg or arising under our articles of association
that restrict the payment of dividends or distributions to holders of our ordinary shares not resident in Luxembourg, except for regulations restricting the
remittance of dividends, distributions, and other payments in compliance with United Nations and EU sanctions. We currently intend to retain any future
earnings for working capital and general corporate purposes. Under Luxembourg law, the amount and payment of dividends or other distributions is determined
by a simple majority vote at a general shareholders’ meeting based on the recommendation of our board of directors, except in certain limited circumstances.
Pursuant to our articles of association, the board of directors has the power to pay interim dividends or make other distributions in accordance with applicable
Luxembourg law. Distributions may be lawfully declared and paid if our net profits and/or distributable reserves are sufficient under Luxembourg law. All of
our ordinary shares rank pari passu with respect to the payment of dividends or other distributions unless the right to dividends or other distributions has been
suspended in accordance with our articles of association or applicable law. Holders of beneficiary certificates are not entitled to receive any dividend payments
with respect to such beneficiary certificates.
         Under Luxembourg law, at least 5% of Spotify Technology S.A.’s net profits per year must be allocated to the creation of a legal reserve until such
reserve has reached an amount equal to 10% of our issued share capital. The allocation to the legal reserve becomes compulsory again when the legal reserve
no longer represents 10% of our issued share capital. The legal reserve is not available for distribution.
         We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our indirect ownership of ordinary shares in our operating subsidiaries. Our ability
to generate income and pay dividends is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends or lend funds to us.
         The registrar and transfer agent for Spotify’s ordinary shares is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.



                                                                               78

including the availability of cash and cash equivalents for use by our affiliated companies, or that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments
to non-resident holders of our securities, except for regulations restricting the remittance of dividends, distributions, and other payments in compliance with
United Nations and EU sanctions.


E. Taxation

Luxembourg Tax Considerations
           The following is an overview of certain material Luxembourg tax consequences of purchasing, owning, and disposing of the ordinary shares issued by
us. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible tax situations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own, or deposit our ordinary shares.
It is included herein solely for preliminary information purposes and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective
purchasers of our ordinary shares should consult their own tax advisers as to the applicable tax consequences of the ownership of our ordinary shares, based on
their particular circumstances. The following description of Luxembourg tax law is based upon Luxembourg law and regulations as in effect and as interpreted
by the Luxembourg tax authorities as of the date of this annual report and is subject to any amendments in law (or in interpretation) later introduced, whether or
not on a retroactive basis. Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg tax assessment
purposes only. Any reference in this section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax laws and/or
concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités),
municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi), and personal income tax (impôt sur le
revenu des personnes physiques) generally. Corporate taxpayers may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune), as well as other duties, levies or
taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax, as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably applies to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg
for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and to the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an
individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

Taxation of the Company

Income Tax
         As the Company is a fully-taxable Luxembourg company, its net taxable profit is as a rule subject to corporate income tax (“CIT”) and municipal
business tax (“MBT”) at ordinary rates in Luxembourg.
          The taxable profit as determined for CIT purposes is applicable, with minor adjustments, for MBT purposes. CIT is levied at an effective maximum
rate of 18.19% in 2023 (inclusive of the 7% surcharge for the employment fund). MBT is levied at a variable rate according to the municipality in which the
Company is located (6.75% in the City of Luxembourg in 2023). The maximum aggregate CIT and MBT rate consequently amounts to 24.94% in 2023 for
companies located in the City of Luxembourg.
         Dividends and other payments derived from ordinary shares by the Company are subject to income taxes, unless the conditions of the participation
exemption regime, as described below, are satisfied. Where the conditions of the participation exemption are not satisfied, a tax credit is generally granted for
withholding taxes levied at source within the limit of the tax payable in Luxembourg on such income, whereby any excess withholding tax is not refundable but
deductible as an operating expense from the tax base.
         Under the participation exemption regime (subject to the relevant anti-abuse rules), dividends derived from ordinary shares may be exempt from
income tax if (i) the distributing company is a qualified subsidiary (“Qualified Subsidiary”), and (ii) at the time the dividend is put at the company’s disposal,
the Company has held or commits itself to hold for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months shares representing a direct participation in the share capital of
the Qualified Subsidiary (a) of at least 10%, or (b) of an acquisition price of at least €1.2 million (or an equivalent amount in another



                                                                                 80
Table of Contents



currency). A Qualified Subsidiary means (i) a Luxembourg resident fully-taxable company limited by share capital (société de capitaux), (ii) a company
covered by Article 2 of the Council Directive 2011/96/EU of November 30, 2011 (the “EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive”), or (iii) a non-resident company
limited by share capital (société de capitaux) liable to a tax corresponding to Luxembourg CIT.
        Liquidation proceeds are assimilated to a received dividend and may be exempt under the same conditions. If the conditions of the participation
exemption regime are not met, dividends derived by the Company from Qualified Subsidiaries may be exempt for 50% of their gross amount.
          Capital gains realized by the Company on shares are subject to CIT and MBT at ordinary rates, unless the conditions of the participation exemption
regime, as described below, are satisfied. Under the participation exemption regime, capital gains realized on shares of a Qualified Subsidiary may be exempt
from CIT and MBT at the level of the Company if at the time the capital gain is realized, the Company has held or commits itself to hold for an uninterrupted
period of at least 12 months shares representing a direct participation in the share capital of the Qualified Subsidiary (i) of at least 10%, or (ii) of an acquisition
price of at least €6 million (or an equivalent amount in another currency). Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the price for which shares have
been disposed of and the lower of their cost or book value.

Withholding Tax
          Dividends paid by us to the holders of our ordinary shares are as a rule subject to a 15% withholding tax in Luxembourg, unless a reduced withholding
tax rate applies pursuant to an applicable double tax treaty or an exemption pursuant to the application of the Luxembourg domestic withholding tax
exemption, and, to the extent withholding tax applies to Luxembourg entities, we are responsible for withholding amounts corresponding to such taxation at its
source.
         If the Company and a U.S. relevant holder are eligible for the benefits of the tax treaty concluded between the United States and Luxembourg (the
“Treaty”), the rate of withholding on distributions shall not exceed 15%, or 5% if the U.S. relevant holder is a qualified resident company as defined in Article
24 of the Treaty that owns at least 10% of our Company’s voting stock.
          An exemption may apply under the withholding tax exemption (subject to the relevant anti-abuse rules) if cumulatively (i) the holder of our ordinary
shares is an eligible parent (“Eligible Parent”), and (ii) at the time the income is made available, the holder of our ordinary shares has held or commits itself to
hold for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months a direct participation of at least 10% of our share capital or a direct participation of an acquisition price of
at least €1.2 million (or an equivalent amount in another currency). Holding a participation through an entity treated as tax transparent from a Luxembourg
income tax perspective is deemed to be a direct participation in proportion to the net assets held in this entity. An Eligible Parent includes (i) a company
covered by Article 2 of the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive or a Luxembourg permanent establishment thereof, (ii) a fully-taxable company limited by share
capital (société de capitaux) resident in Luxembourg, (iii) a company resident in a State having a double tax treaty with Luxembourg and subject to a tax
corresponding to Luxembourg CIT or a Luxembourg permanent establishment thereof, (iv) a company limited by share capital (société de capitaux) or a
cooperative society (société coopérative) resident in the European Economic Area other than an EU Member State and liable to a tax corresponding to
Luxembourg CIT or a Luxembourg permanent establishment thereof, or (v) a Swiss company limited by share capital (société de capitaux) which is effectively
subject to corporate income tax in Switzerland without benefiting from an exemption.
         No withholding tax is levied on capital gains and liquidation proceeds. However, capital gains realized by a non-resident shareholder on the disposal
of shares held in a Luxembourg company may be subject to Luxembourg CIT if they are deemed to be speculative (i.e. if shares are disposed of within six
months after their acquisition or if their disposal precedes their acquisition).

Net Wealth Tax
          The Company is as a rule subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax (“NWT”) on its net assets as determined for net wealth tax purposes. NWT is levied at
the rate of 0.5% on net assets not exceeding €500 million and at the rate of 0.05% on the portion of the net assets exceeding €500 million. Net worth is referred
to as the unitary value (valeur unitaire), as determined at January 1 of each year. The unitary value is in principle calculated as the difference between (i) assets
estimated at their fair market value (valeur estimée de réalisation), and (ii) liabilities vis-à-vis third parties.
        Under the participation exemption regime, a qualified shareholding held by the Company in a Qualified Subsidiary is exempt for net wealth tax
purposes.
        A minimum net wealth tax (“MNWT”) is levied on companies having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg. For entities for
which the sum of fixed financial assets, receivables against related companies, transferable securities, and cash at bank exceeds 90% of their total balance sheet
and €350,000, the MNWT is set at €4,815. For all other



                                                                                  81
Table of Contents



companies having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg, which do not fall within the scope of the €4,815 MNWT, the MNWT ranges
from €535 to €32,100, depending on the company’s total balance sheet.

Other Taxes
         The issuance of our ordinary shares and any other amendment of our articles of association are currently subject to a €75 fixed registration duty. The
disposal of our ordinary shares is not subject to a Luxembourg registration tax or stamp duty, unless recorded in a Luxembourg notarial deed or otherwise
registered in Luxembourg.

Taxation of the Holders of Ordinary Shares

Luxembourg Tax Residency of the Holders of Our Ordinary Shares
         A holder of our ordinary shares will not become resident, nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of the holding and/or disposing
of our ordinary shares or the execution, performance, or enforcement of his/her rights thereunder.

Income Tax—Luxembourg Resident Holders
         Luxembourg Individual Residents. Dividends and other payments derived from our ordinary shares by resident individual holders of our ordinary
shares, who act in the course of the management of either their private wealth or their professional or business activity, are subject to income tax at the ordinary
progressive rates. A tax credit is generally granted for withholding taxes levied at source within the limit of the tax payable in Luxembourg on such income,
whereby any excess withholding tax is not refundable. 50% of the gross amount of dividends received from the Company by resident individual holders of our
ordinary shares are exempt from income tax.
          Capital gains realized on the disposal of our ordinary shares by resident individual holders of our ordinary shares, who act in the course of the
management of their private wealth, are not subject to income tax, unless said capital gains qualify either as speculative gains or as gains on a substantial
participation. Capital gains are deemed to be speculative and are subject to income tax at ordinary rates if our ordinary shares are disposed of within six months
after their acquisition or if their disposal precedes their acquisition. Speculative gains are subject to income tax as miscellaneous income at ordinary rates. A
participation is deemed to be substantial where a resident individual holder of our ordinary shares holds or has held, either alone or together with his/her spouse
or partner and/or minor children, directly or indirectly at any time within the five years preceding the disposal, more than 10% of the share capital of the
Company whose ordinary shares are being disposed of. A holder of our ordinary shares is also deemed to alienate a substantial participation if he acquired free
of charge, within the five years preceding the transfer, a participation that was constituting a substantial participation in the hands of the alienator (or the
alienators in case of successive transfers free of charge within the same five-year period). Capital gains realized on a substantial participation more than six
months after the acquisition thereof are taxed according to the half-global rate method, (i.e., the average rate applicable to the total income is calculated
according to progressive income tax rates and half of the average rate is applied to the capital gains realized on the substantial participation). A disposal may
include a sale, an exchange, a contribution or any other kind of alienation of the participation.
         Capital gains realized on the disposal of our ordinary shares by resident individual holders of our ordinary shares, who act in the course of their
professional or business activity, are subject to income tax at ordinary rates. Taxable gains are determined as the difference between the price for which our
ordinary shares have been disposed of and the lower of their cost or book value.
          Luxembourg Fully-taxable Corporate Residents. Dividends and other payments derived from our ordinary shares by Luxembourg resident fully-
taxable companies are subject to CIT and MBT, unless the conditions of the participation exemption regime, as described below, are satisfied. A tax credit is
generally granted for withholding taxes levied at source within the limit of the tax payable in Luxembourg on such income, whereby any excess withholding
tax is not refundable. If the conditions of the participation exemption regime are not met, 50% of the gross amount of dividends received by Luxembourg
resident, fully-taxable companies from our ordinary shares are exempt from CIT and MBT.
          Under the participation exemption regime (subject to the relevant anti-abuse rules), dividends derived from our ordinary shares may be exempt from
CIT and MBT at the level of the holder of our ordinary shares if cumulatively (i) the holder of our ordinary shares is an Eligible Parent, and (ii) at the time the
dividend is put at the holder of our ordinary shares’ disposal, the holder of our ordinary shares has held or commits itself to hold for an uninterrupted period of
at least 12 months a qualified shareholding (“Qualified Shareholding”). A Qualified Shareholding means ordinary shares representing a direct participation of
at least 10% in the share capital of the Company or a direct participation in the Company of an acquisition price of at least €1.2 million (or an equivalent
amount in another currency). Liquidation proceeds are assimilated to a received dividend and may be exempt under the same conditions. If the conditions of
the participation exemption regime are not met,



                                                                                82
Table of Contents



dividends derived by the holder of the ordinary shares from the Company may be exempt for 50% of their gross amount. Ordinary shares held through a tax-
transparent entity are considered as being a direct participation proportionally to the percentage held in the net assets of the transparent entity.
          Capital gains realized by a Luxembourg resident fully-taxable company on our ordinary shares are subject to CIT and MBT at ordinary rates, unless
the conditions of the participation exemption regime, as described below, are satisfied. Under the participation exemption regime, capital gains realized on our
ordinary shares may be exempt from CIT and MBT at the level of the holder of our ordinary shares if cumulatively (i) the holder of our ordinary shares is an
Eligible Parent, and (ii) at the time the capital gain is realized, the holder of our ordinary shares has held or commits itself to hold for an uninterrupted period of
at least 12 months our ordinary shares representing a direct participation in the share capital of the Company of at least 10% or a direct participation in the
Company of an acquisition price of at least €6 million (or an equivalent amount in another currency). Taxable gains are determined as the difference between
the price for which our ordinary shares have been disposed of and the lower of their cost or book value.
        Luxembourg Residents Benefiting from a Special Tax Regime. Holders of our ordinary shares who are either (i) an undertaking for collective
investment governed by the amended law of December 17, 2010, (ii) a specialized investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, (iii) a
family wealth management company governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007, or (iv) a reserved alternative investment fund treated as a specialized
investment fund for Luxembourg tax purposes governed by the amended law of July 23, 2016, are exempt from income tax in Luxembourg. Dividends derived
from and capital gains realized on our ordinary shares are thus not subject to Luxembourg income tax in their hands.

Income Tax—Luxembourg Non-Resident Holders
          Non-resident holders of our ordinary shares who have neither a permanent establishment nor a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or
whom our ordinary shares are attributable, are not liable to any Luxembourg income tax on income and gains derived from our ordinary shares except capital
gains realized on (i) a substantial participation before the acquisition or within the first six months of the acquisition thereof, or (ii) a substantial participation
more than six months after the acquisition thereof by a holder of our ordinary shares who has been a former Luxembourg resident for more than 15 years and
has become a non-resident, at the time of transfer, less than five years ago. A participation is deemed to be substantial where a shareholder holds or has held,
either alone or, in case of an individual shareholder, together with his/her spouse or partner and/or minor children, directly or indirectly at any time within the
five years preceding the disposal, more than 10% of the share capital of the Company whose ordinary shares are being disposed of. A shareholder is also
deemed to alienate a substantial participation if he acquired free of charge, within the five years preceding the transfer, a participation that was constituting a
substantial participation in the hands of the alienator (or the alienators in case of successive transfers free of charge within the same five-year period).
         If the Company and a U.S. relevant holder are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, such U.S. relevant holder generally should not be subject to
Luxembourg tax on the gain from the disposal of such ordinary shares unless such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment of such U.S. relevant
holder in Luxembourg.
          Non-resident holders of our ordinary shares which have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom
our ordinary shares are attributable, must include any income received, as well as any gain realized, on the sale, disposal or redemption of our ordinary shares,
in their taxable income for Luxembourg tax assessment purposes, unless the conditions of the participation exemption regime, as described below, are satisfied.
If the conditions of the participation exemption regime are not fulfilled, 50% of the gross amount of dividends received by a Luxembourg permanent
establishment or permanent representative may be, however, exempt from income tax. Taxable gains are determined as the difference between the price for
which the ordinary shares have been disposed of and the lower of their cost or book value.
          Under the participation exemption regime (subject to relevant anti-abuse rules), dividends derived from our ordinary shares may be exempt from
income tax if cumulatively (i) our ordinary shares are attributable to a qualified permanent establishment (“Qualified Permanent Establishment”), and (ii) at the
time the dividend is put at the disposal of the Qualified Permanent Establishment, it has held or commits itself to hold a Qualified Shareholding for an
uninterrupted period of at least 12 months. A Qualified Permanent Establishment means (i) a Luxembourg permanent establishment of a company covered by
Article 2 of the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, (ii) a Luxembourg permanent establishment of a company limited by share capital (société de capitaux)
resident in a State having a tax treaty with Luxembourg, and (iii) a Luxembourg permanent establishment of a company limited by share capital (société de
capitaux) or a cooperative society (société coopérative) resident in the European Economic Area other than an EU Member State. Liquidation proceeds are
assimilated to a received dividend and may be exempt under the same conditions. Ordinary shares held through a tax transparent entity are considered as being
a direct participation proportionally to the percentage held in the net assets of the transparent entity.
          Under the participation exemption regime, capital gains realized on our ordinary shares may be exempt from income tax if (i) our ordinary shares are
attributable to a Qualified Permanent Establishment, and (ii) at the time the capital gain is



                                                                                   83
Table of Contents



realized, the Qualified Permanent Establishment has held or commits itself to hold, for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months, our ordinary shares
representing a direct participation in the share capital of the Company of at least 10% or a direct participation in the Company of an acquisition price of at least
€6 million (or an equivalent amount in another currency). Taxable gains are determined as the difference between the price for which our ordinary shares have
been disposed of and the lower of their cost or book value.

Net Wealth Tax
           Luxembourg resident holders of our ordinary shares, as well as non-resident holders of our ordinary shares who have a permanent establishment or a
permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom our ordinary shares are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg NWT on our ordinary shares,
except if the holder is (i) a resident or non-resident individual taxpayer, (ii) a securitization company governed by the amended law of March 22, 2004 on
securitization, (iii) a company governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, (iv) a professional pension institution governed by
the amended law of July 13, 2005, (v) a specialized investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, (vi) a family wealth management
company governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007, (vii) an undertaking for collective investment governed by the amended law of December 17, 2010,
or (viii) a reserved alternative investment fund governed by the amended law of July 23, 2016. However, (i) a securitization company governed by the amended
law of March 22, 2004 on securitization, (ii) a company governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, (iii) a professional pension
institution governed by the amended law of July 13, 2005, and (iv) a tax opaque reserved alternative investment fund treated as a venture capital vehicle for
Luxembourg tax purposes and governed by the amended law of July 23, 2016, remain subject to MNWT.
         Under the participation exemption, a Qualified Shareholding held in the Company by an Eligible Parent or attributable to a Qualified Permanent
Establishment may be exempt. The net wealth tax exemption for a Qualified Shareholding does not require the completion of the 12-month holding period.

Other Taxes
          Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder of our ordinary shares is a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes at the time of
his or her death, our ordinary shares are included in his or her taxable basis for inheritance tax purposes. On the contrary, no inheritance tax is levied on the
transfer of our ordinary shares upon the death of an individual holder in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance purposes.
       Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of our ordinary shares, if the gift is recorded in a Luxembourg notarial deed or otherwise registered in
Luxembourg.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
          The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of our
ordinary shares. This summary deals only with our ordinary shares held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). This summary also does not address the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in special tax
situations including, without limitation, dealers in securities, traders that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, holders that own our ordinary
shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction,” or other integrated investment, banks or other financial institutions, individual retirement
accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, U.S. expatriates, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders that acquired our ordinary shares in a compensatory transaction, or holders that actually or
constructively own 10% or more of the total voting power or value of our ordinary shares.
         This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions,
in each case as in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect). No ruling will be requested from the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the tax consequences owning and disposing of our ordinary shares, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will
agree with the discussion set out below. This summary does not address any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences
(such as the estate and gift tax or the Medicare tax on net investment income).
           As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or
resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof or therein or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a
trust (a) that is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as described in Internal



                                                                                 84
Table of Contents



Revenue Code Section 7701(a)(30), or (b) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
         If an entity or other arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner
in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners of a partnership that holds our ordinary
shares should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning, and disposing of our ordinary shares.

      THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY.
ALL PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM
OF OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL AND
NON-U.S. TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.

Dividends
          Subject to the discussion below under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company,” the amount of dividends paid to a U.S. Holder with respect to our
ordinary shares generally will be included in the U.S. Holder’s gross income as ordinary income from foreign sources to the extent paid out of our current or
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of earnings and profits will be treated as a non-
taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not intend to
calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, U.S. Holders should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as
a dividend even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above. The amount
of any distribution paid in foreign currency will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of such currency, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such
distribution is received, regardless of whether the payment is, in fact, converted into U.S. dollars at that time.
          Foreign withholding tax (if any) paid on dividends on our ordinary shares at the rate applicable to a U.S. Holder (taking into account any applicable
income tax treaty) will, subject to limitations and conditions, be treated as foreign income tax eligible for credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability or, at such holder’s election, eligible for deduction in computing such holder’s U.S. federal taxable income. Dividends paid on our ordinary shares
generally will constitute “passive category income” for purposes of the foreign tax credit. However, if we are a “United States-owned foreign corporation,”
solely for foreign tax credit purposes, a portion of the dividends allocable to our U.S. source earnings and profits may be recharacterized as U.S. source. A
“United States-owned foreign corporation” is any foreign corporation in which United States persons own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more (by vote or by
value) of the stock. In general, United States-owned foreign corporations with less than 10% of earnings and profits attributable to sources within the United
States are excepted from these rules. Although we don’t believe we are currently a “United States-owned foreign corporation,” we may become one in the
future. In such case, if 10% or more of our earnings and profits are attributable to sources within the United States, a portion of the dividends paid on our
ordinary shares allocable to our U.S. source earnings and profits will be treated as U.S. source, and, as such, a U.S. Holder may not offset any foreign tax
withheld as a credit against U.S. federal income tax imposed on that portion of dividends. The rules governing the treatment of foreign taxes imposed on a
U.S. Holder and foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors about the impact of these rules in their particular situations.
         Dividends paid to a non-corporate U.S. Holder by a “qualified foreign corporation” may be subject to reduced rates of taxation if certain holding
period and other requirements are met. “Qualified foreign corporation” generally includes a foreign corporation (other than a foreign corporation that is a PFIC
(as defined below) with respect to the relevant U.S. Holder for the taxable year in which the dividends are paid or for the preceding taxable year) (i) whose
ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or (ii) which is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive U.S.
income tax treaty that includes an exchange of information program and which the U.S. Treasury Department has determined is satisfactory for these purposes.
Our ordinary shares are expected to be readily tradable on the NYSE, an established securities market. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends in light of their particular circumstances. The dividends will not be eligible for the dividends
received deduction available to corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations.

Disposition of Our Ordinary Shares
          Subject to the discussion below under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company,” a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes on the sale or other taxable disposition of our ordinary shares equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized and the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares. In general, capital gains recognized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual, are subject
to a lower rate



                                                                                85
Table of Contents



under current law if such U.S. Holder held shares for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any such gain or loss
generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of the foreign tax credit. A U.S. Holder’s initial tax basis in our ordinary shares generally
will equal the cost of such ordinary shares.
         If the consideration received upon the sale or other taxable disposition of our ordinary shares is paid in foreign currency, the amount realized will be
the U.S. dollar value of the payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. If our ordinary shares are treated as
traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and an accrual basis U.S. Holder who has made a special election (which must be applied
consistently from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized in foreign
currency by translating the amount received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the
special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the exchange rates on the sale date and the settlement
date, and such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

Passive Foreign Investment Company
          In general, a non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year if at least (i) 75% of its gross income is classified as “passive
income,” or (ii) 50% of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) produce or are held for the production of passive income. For these purposes,
cash is considered a passive asset. In making this determination, the non-U.S. corporation is treated as earning its proportionate share of any income and
owning its proportionate share of any assets of any corporation in which it holds a 25% or greater interest. Based on our historic and expected operations,
composition of assets and market capitalization, we do not expect to be classified as a PFIC for the current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. However,
the determination of whether we are a PFIC is made annually. Moreover, the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC determination will generally be
determined by reference to the public price of our ordinary shares, which may fluctuate significantly. Therefore, there is no assurance that we would not be
classified as a PFIC in the future due to, for example, changes in the composition of our assets or income, as well as changes in our market capitalization.
Under the PFIC rules, if we were considered a PFIC at any time that a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, we would continue to be treated as a PFIC with
respect to such holder’s investment unless (i) we cease to be a PFIC, and (ii) the U.S. Holder has made a “deemed sale” election under the PFIC rules.
          If we are considered a PFIC for any taxable year that a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or
other disposition of our ordinary shares would be allocated pro-rata over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares. The amounts allocated to the
taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other
taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that taxable year, and an interest charge
would be imposed. Further, to the extent that any distribution received by a U.S. Holder on our ordinary shares exceeds 125% of the average of the annual
distributions on the ordinary shares received during the preceding three years or the U.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter, that distribution would
be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares if we were a PFIC, as described above. Certain elections
may be available that would result in alternative treatments (such as mark-to-market treatment) of the ordinary shares. If we are treated as a PFIC with respect
to a U.S. Holder for any taxable year, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to own shares in any of our subsidiaries that also are PFICs. A timely election to treat us
as a qualified electing fund under the Internal Revenue Code would result in an alternative treatment. However, we do not intend to prepare or provide the
information that would enable U.S. Holders to make a qualified electing fund election. If we are considered a PFIC, a U.S. Holder also will be subject to annual
information reporting requirements. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers about the potential application of the PFIC rules to an investment in the
ordinary shares.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
         Dividend payments and proceeds paid from the sale or other taxable disposition of ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS.
In addition, a U.S. Holder (other than exempt holders who establish their exempt status if required) may be subject to backup withholding on cash payments
received in connection with dividend payments and proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of our ordinary shares made within the United States or
through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries.
          Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, makes other required
certification and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any
amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be creditable or refundable against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.



                                                                                 86

Foreign Financial Asset Reporting
           Certain U.S. Holders are required to report their holdings of certain foreign financial assets, including equity of foreign entities, if the aggregate value
of all of these assets exceeds certain threshold amounts. The ordinary shares are expected to constitute foreign financial assets subject to these requirements
unless the ordinary shares are held in an account at certain financial institutions. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of
these reporting requirements.

FATCA
         Provisions under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations commonly referred to as
“FATCA” generally impose 30% withholding on certain “withholdable payments” and, in the future, may impose such withholding on “foreign passthru
payments” made by a “foreign financial institution” (each as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) that has entered into an agreement with the IRS to perform
certain diligence and reporting obligations with respect to the foreign financial institution’s U.S.-owned accounts. The United States has entered into an
intergovernmental agreement, or IGA, with Luxembourg, implemented by the Luxembourg law dated July 24, 2015 and amended on June 18, 2020, which
modifies the FATCA withholding regime described above. Under the regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments would apply to passthru
payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments. Although these regulations are not final, taxpayers generally may rely on them until final regulations are issued. U.S. Holders should consult their
tax advisors regarding the potential impact of FATCA, the Luxembourg IGA and any non-U.S. legislation implementing FATCA on the investment in our
ordinary shares.

Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
          Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks. Our primary market risk exposures relate to currency, interest rate, share price, investment, and
inflation risks. To manage these risks and our exposure to the unpredictability of financial markets, we seek to minimize potential adverse effects on our
financial performance and capital.



                                                                                  87

         Volatile market conditions caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, inflation, changes in interest rates,
geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty, may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates,
and share prices, both our own and those of third parties we use to value certain of our long term investments. Refer to Part I. “Item 3.D. Risk Factors” in this
document for further discussion.

Financial risk management
         Our operations are exposed to financial risks. To manage these risks efficiently, we have established guidelines in the form of a treasury policy that
serves as a framework for our daily financial operations. The treasury policy stipulates the rules and limitations for the management of financial risks.
         Financial risk management is centralized within Treasury who are responsible for the management of financial risks. Treasury manages and executes
the financial management activities, including monitoring the exposure of financial risks, cash management, and maintaining a liquidity reserve. Treasury
operates within the limits and policies authorized by the board of directors.

Currency risk
          Currency risk manifests itself in transaction exposure, which relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by operations
(purchasing and selling) and/or financing (interest and amortization). The volatility in foreign exchange rates, in particular a weakening of foreign currencies
relative to the Euro, may negatively affect our revenue. Our general policy is to hedge transaction exposure on a case-by-case basis. Translation exposure
relates to net investments in foreign operations. We do not conduct translation risk hedging.

Transaction exposure sensitivity
          In most cases, our customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental fees are settled
in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily settled in Euros and U.S. dollars. Hence, the operational need to net purchase foreign currency is due
primarily to a deficit from such settlements.
         The table below shows the immediate impact on net income before tax of a 10% strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro in the closing
exchange rate of significant currencies to which we have transaction exposure at December 31, 2023. The sensitivity associated with a 10% weakening of a
particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.
                                                                                               Swedish krona              British pound              U.S. dollar

(Increase)/decrease in loss before tax                                                                         (16)                         (20)                   60


Translation exposure sensitivity
        The impact on our equity would be approximately €127 million if the Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on the
exposure at December 31, 2023.

Interest rate risk
          Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows. Our exposure to interest rate risk is
related to our interest-bearing assets, including our cash and cash equivalents and our short term debt securities. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield
of the investment. The sensitivity analysis considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and we determined that it was reasonably possible that
a change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have impacted interest
income by €40 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Share price risk
         Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the
Company’s ordinary share price. Our exposure to this risk relates primarily to the Exchangeable Notes, outstanding warrants, and accrual for social costs on
outstanding share-based compensation awards.
         A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,197
million to €1,210 million at December 31, 2023.



                                                                                 88
Table of Contents



         A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the warrants ranging from €2 million to €6
million at December 31, 2023.
        A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a change in the accrual for social costs on outstanding share-
based compensation awards ranging from €17 million to €18 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023.

Investment risk
         We are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our long term investments, due primarily to volatility in the share
price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of our long term investments relate to TME. A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share
price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from €1,039 million to €1,270 million at December 31, 2023.

Inflation risk
          Inflationary factors, such as increases in costs, may adversely affect our results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant
inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases for our Premium Service or sale of advertisements. Our
inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Item 15. Controls and Procedures


A. Disclosure Controls and Procedures
         As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 20-F. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
         In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in
evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.


B. Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
         Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst &
Young AB, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
         The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in
designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system
of internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot
assure that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.


C. Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm
         Please see the report of Ernst & Young AB, an independent registered public accounting firm, included in “Item 18. Financial Statements.”


D. Changes in internal control over financial reporting
        There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert
        Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Thomas Staggs is an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F. All audit
committee members satisfy the independence requirements set forth under the rules of the NYSE and in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.



                                                                                90

Item 16B. Code of Ethics
         We have adopted the Spotify Code of Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our directors, officers, employees, consultants, and others working
on our behalf, and is intended to meet the definition of “code of ethics” under Item 16B of Form 20-F. The Spotify Code of Conduct and Ethics is available on
our website at investors.spotify.com. We did not grant any waivers to the Spotify Code of Conduct and Ethics during the year ended December 31, 2023.

          “Audit fees” are the aggregate fees earned by the Ernst & Young entities for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements, reviews of
interim financial statements and attestation services that are provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. “Audit-related fees”
are fees charged by the Ernst & Young entities for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our
financial statements and are not reported under “Audit fees.” This category comprises fees for internal control reviews, agreed-upon procedure engagements
and other attestation services subject to regulatory requirements. “Tax Fees” include fees billed for tax compliance. “All other fees” are the fees for products
and services other than those in the above three categories.
         All audit services and non-audit services to be performed for us by our independent auditor must be approved by our Audit Committee in advance to
ensure that such engagements do not impair the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee generally pre-
approves particular services or categories of services on a case-by-case basis. All services provided to us by our independent auditor in 2023 and 2022 were
pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

Item 16E. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers
          On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s
ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares were authorized at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders on
April 21, 2021. The authorization to repurchase will expire on April 21, 2026 unless renewed by the decision of a general meeting of shareholders of the
Company. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and
alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program will be executed consistent with the Company's capital allocation strategy of prioritizing
investment to grow the business over the long term.
                                                                                                                                          Total Number of

Item 16G. Corporate Governance
          Our common shares are listed on the NYSE. For purposes of NYSE rules, so long as we are a foreign private issuer, we are eligible to take advantage
of certain exemptions from NYSE corporate governance requirements provided in the NYSE rules. We are required to disclose the significant ways in which
our corporate governance practices differ from those that apply to U.S. companies under NYSE listing standards. Set forth below is a summary of these
differences:
         Board Committees—The NYSE rules require domestic companies to have a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance
committee composed entirely of independent directors, but as a foreign private issuer we are exempt from these requirements. We have a people experience and
compensation committee composed of four members, and we believe three of the committee members satisfy the “independence” requirements of the NYSE
rules. We do not have a nominating and corporate governance committee.
          Shareholder Approval of Equity Plans—The NYSE rules require shareholder approval of stock option plans and other equity compensation
arrangements available to officers, directors or employees and any material amendments thereto, but as a foreign private issuer we are permitted to follow
home country practice in lieu of those rules. Under home country practice, shareholder approval of stock option plans and other equity compensation
arrangements is not required; however, we are required to seek shareholder approval of the compensation paid to our directors. The Company’s board of
directors approves the stock option plans and other equity compensation arrangements that do not require shareholder approval under our home country
practice.

Item 16K. Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
          We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
our critical systems and information. To protect our systems and information from cybersecurity threats, we use a variety of security tools and techniques,
including a bug bounty program, in order to prevent, detect, investigate, contain, escalate, and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents.
          Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies
and reporting channels that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other risk areas. Our Internal Audit & Risk team is principally responsible
for facilitating our enterprise risk management program, in consultation with multiple functions at Spotify and reporting to the Audit Committee.
          Our cybersecurity risk management program includes:
      •   an Information Security Policy that articulates our information security practices and procedures to maintain confidence in our business and to protect
          the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information we handle;
      •   a dedicated Head of Security responsible for executing on relevant internal and external requirements and identifying appropriate technical and
          organizational measures to deliver information security in compliance with those



                                                                                               93

         requirements (in consultation with our Data Protection Officer who is responsible for advising on legal obligations with regard to personal data
         privacy);
    •    a Security Risk & Control team, led by Head of Security, principally responsible for driving our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, including a
         formal information security risk assessment on an at least annual basis; our security controls framework and risk remediation and prioritizations; and
         risk awareness or education programs for employees relating to cybersecurity;
    •    the use of both internal and external resources, such as assessors, consultants, and auditors, where appropriate, to assess, test, or otherwise assist with
         aspects of our security controls;
    •    an external audit of our systems and environments in scope for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, including an external penetration test,
         on an annual basis;
    •    cybersecurity training of our incident response personnel and senior management;
    •    a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for assessing, responding to, remediating, resolving, and conducting post-analysis of
         cybersecurity incidents;
    •    a vendor assessment program designed to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers; and
    •    contractual obligations on third-party vendors to report security incidents, risk identification, or other security-related issues promptly to designated
         contact personnel at Spotify.
          We and certain of our third-party service providers have been subject to cyberattacks and security incidents in the past due to, for example, computer
malware, viruses, computer hacking, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks. We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a
result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business
strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such
attacks, and we expect to experience cyberattacks and security incidents in the future. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Failure
to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or the security of confidential information could result in civil liability, statutory fines,
regulatory enforcement, and the loss of confidence in us by our users, advertisers, content providers, and other business partners, all of which could harm our
business” and “—Interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our own systems or from third parties could harm our business.”

Cybersecurity Governance
        Our board of directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of our
cybersecurity and data protection program.
         The Audit Committee receives quarterly updates from management on our cybersecurity and data protection programs, including related trends or
metrics. The Audit Committee also receives annual updates from our Head of Security and our Data Protection Officer regarding the state of our cybersecurity
and data protection programs, including key issues, priorities, and challenges.
         In addition to any reports from the Audit Committee to the full board regarding cybersecurity, management informs and updates the full board about
any significant cybersecurity incidents. The full board also receives briefings from management on key components of our programs and any pressing risk or
compliance matters.
         Our management team, including the Head of Security, is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team
has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained
external cybersecurity consultants. Our Head of Security has over 20 years of experience in executive leadership across multiple industries in the areas of
information security, digital transformation, and enterprise risk management.
         Our management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which
may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public, or private sources,
including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.

                                                 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Spotify Technology S.A.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Spotify Technology S.A. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and
2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 8, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the
critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.



                                                                               F-2

Royalty Costs
Description of the Matter           As explained in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and
                                    distribution costs related to content streaming.
                                    Royalties are typically calculated monthly using negotiated rates in accordance with license agreements and are based
                                    on either subscription and advertising revenue earned, user/usage measures, or a combination of these. The
                                    determination of the amount of royalty cost is subject to a number of variables including the revenue recognized, type of
                                    content, country, product tier, license holder, size of user base, ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers,
                                    and any applicable advertising fees and discounts, among others.

                                    The Company’s royalty cost process utilizes complex proprietary systems for the initiation, processing and recording of
                                    a significant volume of data. Auditing the royalty cost process and related inputs and variables required significant audit
                                    effort.

How We Addressed the Matter in      We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the
Our Audit                           Company’s process to determine royalty costs. For example, we tested controls specific to the calculation of royalties,
                                    inputs, variables, and IT systems.

                                    To test the Company’s royalty costs, our audit procedures included recalculating royalty cost amounts, testing the
                                    completeness and accuracy of the underlying calculation inputs and variables, and comparing royalty rates to license
                                    agreements.

                                                 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spotify Technology S.A.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Spotify Technology S.A.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control
—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our
opinion, Spotify Technology S.A. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2023, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss,
changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 8,
2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the 2023 consolidated financial statements


1. Corporate information
              Spotify Technology S.A. (the “Company” or “parent”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s
registered office is 5, place de la Gare L-1616, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
              The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group,” "we," "us," or "our") is audio streaming. The Group’s
premium service (“Premium Service”) provides users with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts. In
select markets, the Premium Service provides eligible users with limited online and offline streaming access to its catalog of audiobooks. The Premium Service
offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks. The Group’s ad-supported service (“Ad-Supported Service” and together with the Premium
Service, the “Service”) has no subscription fees and provides users with limited on-demand online access to the catalog of music and unlimited online access to
the catalog of podcasts. The Group depends on securing content licenses from a number of major and minor content owners and other rights holders in order to
provide its service.


2. Summary of material accounting policies
             The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been
applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

(a)          Basis of preparation
               The consolidated financial statements of Spotify Technology S.A. comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for short term investments, long term
investments, Exchangeable Senior Notes (the "Exchangeable Notes"), and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value, and lease
liabilities, which are measured at present value.
             The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the application of certain critical accounting estimates
and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a greater degree
of judgment or complexity, or areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3.

(b)          Basis of consolidation
              Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed, or has right to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the
date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

(c)          Foreign currency translation

Functional and reporting currency
             Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Group’s reporting currency.

Transactions and balances
             Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within finance income or finance costs.

Group companies
              The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the Group's reporting currency are
translated into Euro as follows:
                •      Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;



                                                                                  F-10
Table of Contents



                •      Income and expenses for each statement of operation are translated at average exchange rates; and
                •      All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss).

               Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the operation and
translated at the closing rate at each reporting date.

(d)        Revenue recognition

Premium revenue
              The Group generates subscription revenue through the sale of the Premium Service in which customers can listen on-demand and offline. The
Premium Service is primarily sold directly to end users. The Premium Service is also sold through partners who are generally telecommunications companies
that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end customers. Typically, the Premium
Service is paid for on a monthly basis in advance. The Group satisfies its performance obligation to provide Premium streaming services, and revenue from
these services is recognized, on a straight-line basis over the subscription period.
               Sometimes the Group bundles the Premium Service with other services and products. Additionally, in certain markets the specified monthly
allocation of audiobook access within the Premium Service is considered to be a separate performance obligation to the customer. In arrangements where the
Group has multiple performance obligations to the customer, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone
selling price. The Group generally determines stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers; but where stand-alone selling prices are not
directly observable, estimation techniques are used. In the markets where the Group offers audiobook listening time as part of the Premium subscription, the
Group satisfies its performance obligation to provide a monthly entitlement to specified hours of audiobook content as these hours are consumed and recognize
revenue over time using an output method based on the proportion of hours consumed. Additionally, the Group estimates how many hours of audiobook
content will not be used by eligible Premium Subscribers and recognizes the revenue attributable to the unexercised rights in proportion to the pattern of
audiobook consumption. For other bundles, revenue is recognized either on a straight-line basis over the subscription period or at a point in time when control
of the service or product is transferred to the customer.
             Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. Under these arrangements, a premium
partner may bundle the Premium Service with its existing product offerings or offer the Premium Service as an add-on. Payment is remitted to the Group
through the premium partner. The Group assesses the facts and circumstances, including whether the partner is acting as a principal or agent, of all partner
revenue arrangements and then recognizes revenues either gross or net. Premium partner services, whether recognized gross or net, generally have one material
performance obligation, which is the delivery of the Premium Service.

Ad-Supported revenue
              The Group’s advertising revenue is generated primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising
impressions across music and podcast content. The Group enters into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on our platform on
behalf of their clients. The Group also enters into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a
cost-per-thousand basis and are evidenced by an Insertion Order, a submission of order placements through a self-serve platform that includes the online
acceptance of terms and conditions, or contracts that specify the terms of the arrangement such as the type of ad product, pricing, insertion dates, and number
of impressions in a stated period. Revenue is recognized based on the number of impressions delivered.
              Additionally, the Group generates Ad-Supported revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal self-serve,
and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis. Revenue is recognized when impressions
are delivered on the platform.

(e)           Advertising credits
              Advertising credits that are not transferable are issued to certain rights holders and allow them to include advertisements on the Ad-Supported
Service that promote their artists and the Spotify service, such as the availability of a new single or album on Spotify. These are issued in conjunction with the
Group’s royalty arrangements for no additional consideration. There is no revenue recognized as the advertising credits are mutually beneficial to both the
rights holders and the Group and do not meet the definition of a revenue contract under IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.



                                                                                F-11
Table of Contents




(f)           Business combinations
               Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured initially
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred, and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the
acquiree, over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill.
              Acquisition-related costs, other than those incurred for the issuance of debt or equity instruments, are charged to the consolidated statement of
operations as they are incurred.

(g)           Cost of revenue
               Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming. The Group incurs royalty costs paid to
record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders for the right to stream content to the Group’s users. Royalties are typically calculated monthly using
negotiated rates in accordance with license agreements and are based on either subscription and advertising revenue earned, user/usage measures, or a
combination of these. The determination of the amount of the rights holders’ liability requires complex IT systems and a significant volume of data and is
subject to a number of variables, including the revenue recognized, the type of content streamed and the country in which it is streamed, the product tier such
content is streamed on, identification of the appropriate license holder, size of user base, ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, and any
applicable advertising fees and discounts, among other variables. Some rights holders have allowed the use of their content on the platform while negotiations
of the terms and conditions or determination of statutory rates are ongoing. In such situations, royalties are calculated using estimated rates. In certain
jurisdictions, rights holders have several years to claim royalties for musical compositions, and therefore, estimates of the royalties payable are made until
payments are made. The Group has certain arrangements whereby royalty costs are paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. An accrual
is established when actual royalty costs to be incurred during a contractual period are expected to fall short of the minimum guaranteed amounts. For minimum
guarantee arrangements, for which the Group cannot reliably predict the underlying expense, the Group will expense the minimum guarantee on a straight-line
basis over the term of the arrangement. The Group also has certain royalty arrangements where the Group would have to make additional payments if the
royalty rates were below those paid to other similar licensors (most favored nation clauses). For rights holders with this clause, a comparison is done of
royalties incurred to date plus estimated royalties payable for the remainder of the period to estimates of the royalties payables to other appropriate rights
holders, and the shortfall, if any, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the applicable most favored nation clause. An accrual and expense is
recognized when it is probable that the Group will make additional royalty payments under these terms. The expense related to these accruals is recognized in
cost of revenue. Cost of revenue also reflects discounts provided by certain rights holders in return for promotional activities in connection with marketplace
programs. In certain contracts, payments to rights holders can be due based on uncertain future events which might not be resolved for several months. Where
this is the case, the Group recognizes this expense only if and when the uncertainty is resolved. Additionally, cost of revenue includes credit card and payment
processing fees for subscription revenue, advertising serving, advertising measurement, customer service, certain employee compensation and benefits, cloud
computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs, as well as the amortization of podcast content assets.
              Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life, or the license period (if relevant), and
begins at the release of each episode. In most cases, amortization is on an accelerated basis. We make payments to podcast publishers, whose content we
monetize through advertising sales. The amounts owed are most often a share of revenues and recognized in cost of revenue when the related revenue is
recognized.

(h)           Research and development expenses
             Research and development expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for development of products related to the Group’s platform and service,
as well as new advertising products and improvements to the Group’s mobile and desktop applications and streaming services. The costs incurred include
related employee compensation and benefits costs, consulting costs, and facilities costs.

(i)           Sales and marketing expenses
              Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, sponsorships, public relations, branding, consulting
expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, live events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with music
record labels, publishers, songwriters, artists, podcasters, and audiobook publishers to promote the availability of new releases on the Group’s platform, and the
costs of providing free trials. Expenses included in the costs of providing free trials are derived primarily from per user royalty fees determined in accordance
with the rights holder agreements.



                                                                                 F-12

(j)          General and administrative expenses
             General and administrative expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits for functions such as finance, accounting, analytics,
legal, human resources, consulting fees, and other costs including facility and equipment costs, directors' and officers’ liability insurance, and director fees.

(k)          Income tax
               The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations except to the
extent it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
             (i)       Current tax
             Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or
             receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
             (ii)      Deferred tax
             Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
             purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for:
                •      temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination, that affects
                       neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences;
                •      temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, and associates to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of
                       the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
                •      taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
             Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that
             future taxable profits will be available, against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to
             the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.
             Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or
             substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in
             which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
             Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met, such as when there is a legally enforceable right to offset.
             (iii)     Uncertain tax positions
             Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns in which applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, and considers
             whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures its tax balances either based on the
             most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.

(l)          Leases
              At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to
control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether:
                •      the contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or
                       represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is
                       not identified;
                •      the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and



                                                                                  F-13
Table of Contents



                  •     the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Group has this right when it has the decision-making rights that are most
                        relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.
           At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease
component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.

As a Lessee
              The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,
which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs
incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received prior to the commencement date. Any costs related to the removal and restoration of leasehold improvements, which meet the definition of
property, plant and equipment under IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment are assessed under IAS 37 and are not within the scope of IFRS 16.
               The lease term is determined based on the non-cancellable period for which the Group has the right to use an underlying asset. The lease term is
adjusted, if applicable, for periods covered by extension and termination options to the extent the Group is reasonably certain to exercise them.
              The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, which
is considered the appropriate useful life of these assets. In addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability, to the extent necessary. See Note 11 for further information.
          The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, net of lease incentives receivable, that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using an incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease arrangement is not readily determinable.
            Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments and variable
lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date.
               The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect accretion of interest and reduced for lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a
change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, lease term, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an
extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
                The Group leases certain properties under non-cancellable lease agreements that relate to office space. The expected lease terms are between one
and 10 years.
                As of December 31, 2023, the Group has not acted in the capacity of a lessor.

Short-term leases and lease of low-value assets
               The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less
and leases of low-value assets, including certain IT Equipment. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

(m)             Property and equipment
             Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost
includes any expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by the Group.
             The Group adds to the carrying amount of an item of property and equipment the cost of replacing parts of such an item if the replacement part is
expected to provide incremental future benefits to the Group. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated statement of operations during the
period in which they are incurred.
               After assets are placed into service, depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful
lives, using the straight-line method as follows:
                  •     Property and equipment: 3 to 5 years
                  •     Leasehold improvements: shorter of the lease term or useful life



                                                                                  F-14
Table of Contents



              The assets’ residual values, useful lives, and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively if there is an indication of a
significant change. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated
recoverable amount.
             Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations when the asset is derecognized.

(n)           Intangible assets
              Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill comprise acquired developed technology, trade names, customer relationships, publisher
relationships, and patents. At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value as of the date of
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
             The Group recognizes internal development costs as intangible assets only when the following criteria are met: the technical feasibility of
completing the intangible asset exists; there is an intent to complete and an ability to use or sell the intangible asset; the intangible asset will generate probable
future economic benefits; there are adequate resources available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and there is the ability to
reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
               Intangible assets with finite lives are typically amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically 3 to 5 years for
technology, 3 to 8 years for trade names and trademarks, 3 to 10 years for customer and publisher relationships, and are assessed for impairment whenever
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset are reviewed at
least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for
by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization of intangible assets is
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

(o)           Goodwill
               Goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested
annually for impairment, or more regularly if certain indicators are present. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination
is allocated to each of the operating segments that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represent the lowest level at which the
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of the Group’s operating
segments to the carrying amount of the operating segments to which the goodwill relates. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an
impairment charge is determined.
             The recoverable amount of the operating segments is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The Group determines the fair value of the
operating segments using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market-based approach.

(p)           Impairment of non-financial assets
              Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations consistent with the function of the assets,
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash
inflows. Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal each reporting period. For more information on
impairment of non-financial assets, including real estate assets, refer to Note 11 and 12.

(q)           Financial instruments

              (i)      Financial assets

              Initial recognition and measurement
              The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, trade and other receivables, derivative assets, long term
              investments, restricted cash, and other non-current assets. All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
              attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the settlement date; the date that the



                                                                                 F-15
Table of Contents



            Group receives or delivers the asset. Receivables are non-derivative financial assets, other than short term and long term investments described
            below, with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets except for those with
            maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period.
            For more information on receivables, refer to Note 15.
            Short term investments primarily comprise debt instruments carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. The securities in this
            category are those that are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and that may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in
            response to changes in the market conditions (therefore, not recognized at amortized cost). These meet both the hold to collect and sell business
            model and solely payments of principal and interest contractual cash flows tests under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. These are classified as
            current assets.
            Long term investments primarily comprise equity instruments carried at fair value through other comprehensive income based on the irrevocable
            election made at initial recognition under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The securities within this category are intended to be held for an
            indefinite period of time and for strategic investment purposes. These are not held for trading. These are classified as non-current assets. The
            Group’s primary long term investment is its equity investment in Tencent Music Entertainment Group (“TME”).

            Subsequent measurement
            After initial measurement, short term investments are primarily measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in other
            comprehensive income and credited in other reserves within equity until the investment is derecognized, at which time, the cumulative gain or
            loss is recognized in finance income/costs. Interest earned whilst holding the short term investments is reported as interest income using the
            effective interest method. Interest income and foreign exchange revaluation are recognized in the statement of operations in the same manner as
            all other financial assets.
            After initial measurement, long term investments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, including any related foreign
            exchange impacts, recognized in other comprehensive income and credited in other reserves within equity without recognizing fair value changes
            to profit and loss upon derecognition. Gains or losses realized on the sale of these long term investments are not recycled through the profit and
            loss, but are instead reclassified to accumulated deficit within equity. Dividends received are recognized in the consolidated statement of
            operations in finance income.

            Derecognition
            Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.

            Impairment of financial assets
            The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired, primarily
            its trade receivables and short term investments. The Group assesses impairment for its financial assets, excluding trade receivables, using the
            general expected credit losses model. Under this model, the Group calculates the allowance for credit losses by considering on a discounted basis,
            the cash shortfalls it would incur in various default scenarios for prescribed future periods and multiplying the shortfalls by the probability of each
            scenario occurring. The allowance on the financial asset is the sum of these probability-weighted outcomes.
            For the Group’s short term investments, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification as the credit risk related to these assets is low given
            the credit quality ratings required by the Group’s investment policy. At every reporting date, the Group evaluates whether a particular debt
            instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all supportable information.
            The Group’s long term equity investments are not assessed for impairment due to the irrevocable election made under IFRS 9 Financial
            Instruments as stated above.
            The Group uses the simplified approach for measuring impairment for its trade receivables as these financial assets do not have a significant
            financing component as defined under IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Therefore, the Group does not determine if the credit
            risk for these instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition. Instead, a loss allowance is recognized based on lifetime expected
            credit losses at each reporting date. Impairment losses and subsequent reversals are recognized in profit or loss and is the amount required to
            adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognized



                                                                              F-16
Table of Contents



            based on the aforementioned policy. The Group has established a provision matrix based on its historical credit loss experiences, adjusted for
            forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an
            allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.

            (ii)     Financial liabilities

            Initial recognition and measurement
            The Group’s financial liabilities are comprised of trade and other payables, lease liabilities, Exchangeable Notes, derivative liabilities (warrants
            and instruments designated for hedging), and other liabilities. All financial liabilities except lease liabilities are recognized initially at fair value.
            The Group accounts for the Exchangeable Notes at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS 9,
            Financial Instruments. Under this approach, the Exchangeable Notes are accounted for in their entirety at fair value, with any change in fair value
            after initial measurement being recorded in finance income or cost in the consolidated statement of operations, except that changes in fair value
            that are due to changes in own credit risk are presented separately in other comprehensive income/(loss) and will not be reclassified to the
            consolidated statement of operations. The Group classified the Exchangeable Notes as a financial liability in accordance with IAS 32, Financial
            Instruments: Presentation.
            The Group accounts for the warrants as a financial liability measured at fair value through profit or loss. In accordance with IAS 32, Financial
            Instruments: Presentation, the Group determined that the warrants were precluded from equity classification, because while they contain no
            contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial instruments to the holders other than the Company’s own shares, the exercise prices of the
            warrants are in US$ and not the Company’s functional currency and the Group allows for net settlement, which enables settlement for a variable
            number of the Company’s ordinary shares. Therefore, the warrants do not meet the requirements that they be settled by the issuer exchanging a
            fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.

            Subsequent measurements
            Other financial liabilities
            After initial recognition, payables are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method
            amortization is included in finance costs in the consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated
            statement of operations when the liabilities are derecognized.
            Payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
            after the reporting date.
            Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
            After initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss are subsequently re-measured at fair value at the end of each
            reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in finance income or finance costs in the consolidated statement of operations.

            Derecognition
            Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled, or expires.

            (iii)    Fair value measurements
            For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset or pay
            to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for identical
            assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data,
            internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.
            Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Group’s market assumptions. All
            assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value
            hierarchy, are described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
               •     Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;



                                                                                F-17
Table of Contents



                •      Level 2: other techniques for which inputs are based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active,
                       quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are
                       observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and,
                •      Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recognized fair value that require the Group to use its own
                       assumptions about market participant assumptions.
             The Group maintains policies and procedures to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using what it considers to be the most
             relevant and reliable market participant data available. It is the Group’s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs in the measurement of its
             Level 3 fair value measurements. To the extent observable inputs are not available, the Group utilizes unobservable inputs based upon the
             assumptions market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. In determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
             employing Level 3 inputs, the Group considers such factors as the current interest rate, equity market, currency and credit environments, expected
             future cash flows, the probability of certain future events occurring, and other published data. The Group performs a variety of procedures to
             assess the reasonableness of its fair value determinations, including the use of third parties.

             (iv)      Foreign exchange forward contracts
             The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges when all the requirements in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
             are met. The Group recognizes these foreign exchange forward contracts as either assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position and
             they are measured at fair value at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of
             financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis. The asset
             and liability positions of the foreign exchange forward contracts are included in other current assets and derivative liabilities on the consolidated
             statement of financial position, respectively. The Group reflects the gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of
             equity and subsequently reclassifies cumulative gains and losses to revenues or cost of revenues, depending on the risk hedged, when the hedged
             transactions impact the statement of operations. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in other
             reserves are immediately reclassified to finance income or costs. Foreign exchange forward contracts that do not meet the requirements in IFRS 9
             Financial Instruments to be designated as a cash flow hedge, are classified as derivative instruments not designated for hedging. The Group
             measures these instruments at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in finance income or costs. Refer to Note 23.

(r)          Podcast content assets
              The Group incurs costs to acquire, license, produce or commission podcasts for inclusion on the Service, with some titles distributed more
broadly. We recognize podcast content assets as current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position and related cash flows are presented as
operating cash flows. Fees, including license fees, and the direct costs of production including employee compensation and production overheads, external
production services and participation minimum guarantees are capitalized. We often enter into multi-year commitments, however, the period between payments
and receipt of content is typically less than a year and no borrowing costs are included in direct costs. All podcast content costs are recorded in the Ad-
Supported segment.
               Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded in cost of revenue over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period
(if relevant), and begins at the release of each episode. The economic life and expected amortization profile of podcast content assets is estimated by
management based on historical listening patterns and is evaluated on an ongoing basis. The Group’s podcast content assets are generally expected to be
consumed in less than three years, and typically, on an accelerated basis, as we expect more upfront listening in most cases.

(s)          Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
              Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on deposit at banks and on hand and highly liquid investments including money market funds with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase that are not subject to restrictions. Assets in money market funds, whose contractual cash flows do not
represent solely payments of interest and principal, are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in the
consolidated statement of operations. See Note 23.
               Cash deposits that have restrictions governing their use are classified as restricted cash, current or non-current, based on the remaining length of
the restriction. See Note 14.



                                                                                F-18
Table of Contents




(t)           Short term investments
              The Group invests in a variety of instruments, such as commercial paper, corporate debt securities, collateralized reverse purchase agreements,
and government and agency debt securities. Part of these investments are held in short duration, fixed income portfolios. The average duration of these
instruments is less than two years. All investments are governed by an investment policy and are held in highly rated counterparties. Separate credit limits are
assigned to each counterparty in order to minimize risk concentration.
               These investments are classified as debt instruments and are carried primarily at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a
component of equity. Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates whether the investments
pass both the hold to collect and sell and solely payments of principal and interest tests. The short term investments with maturities greater than 12 months are
classified as short term when they are intended for use in current operations. The cost basis for investments sold is based upon the specific identification
method.

(u)           Long term investments
              Long term investments consist primarily of non-controlling equity interests in public and private companies where the Group does not exercise
significant influence. The majority of the investments are classified as equity instruments carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. Refer to
Note 23.

(v)           Share capital
              Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
              Equity instruments are initially measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing
the equity instruments.
              The Group repurchases its ordinary shares through a share repurchase program approved by the board of directors. The cost of shares repurchased
is shown as a reduction to equity on the statement of financial position. When treasury shares are sold, reissued, or retired, the amount received is reflected as
an increase to equity based on a weighted-average cost, with any surplus or deficit recorded within other paid in capital.

(w)           Share-based compensation
           Employees of the Group and members of the board of directors receive remuneration in the form of share-based compensation transactions,
whereby employees and the board of directors render services in consideration for equity instruments.
             The cost of such equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date of grant using an appropriate valuation model. The cost is
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, together with a corresponding credit to other reserves in equity, over the period in which the
performance and service conditions are fulfilled.
              The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the Group’s best estimate
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized at the
beginning and end of that period, and is recognized in employee share-based compensation. When the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are
modified, the minimum expense recognized is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional
expense is recognized for modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based compensation transaction or are otherwise beneficial to the grantee
as measured at the date of modification. There were no material modifications to any share-based compensation transactions during 2023, 2022, and 2021.
              Social costs are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation. Social costs in connection with
granted options and restricted stock units are accrued over the vesting period, based on the intrinsic value of the award that has been earned at the end of each
reporting period. The amount of the liability reflects the amortization of the award and the impact of expected forfeitures. The social cost rate at which the
accrual is made generally follows the tax domicile within which other compensation charges for a grantee are recognized.
              The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based compensation transactions are disclosed in Note 18.
              In many jurisdictions, tax authorities levy taxes on share-based compensation transactions with employees that give rise to a personal tax liability
for the employee. In some cases, the Group is required to withhold the tax due and to settle it with the tax authority on behalf of the employees. To fulfill this
obligation, the terms of the Group’s restricted stock unit arrangements permit the Group to withhold the number of shares that are equal to the monetary value
of the employee’s tax



                                                                                F-19
Table of Contents



obligation from the total number of shares that otherwise would have been issued to the employee upon vesting of the restricted stock unit. The monetary value
of the employee’s tax obligation is recorded as a deduction from Other reserves for the shares withheld.

(x)          Employee benefits
             The Group provides defined contribution plans to its employees. The Group pays contributions to publicly and privately administered pension
insurance plans on a mandatory or contractual basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Contributions to
defined contribution plans are expensed when employees provide services. The Group’s post-employment schemes do not include any defined benefit plans.

(y)          Provisions
              Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group

Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12
             On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted the amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes ("IAS 12 Amendment") which requires recognition of deferred
taxes on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. This amendment applies to
differences associated with right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and decommissioning obligations. This amendment is applied to transactions that occurred on or
after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The adoption of the IAS 12 Amendment did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12
            Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The legislation will be
effective for the Group’s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The rules will impose a minimum 15% effective tax rate, based on the OECD’s Pillar Two
Model Rules, applicable in each jurisdiction in which the Group operates. In May 2023, the IASB amended IAS 12 Income Taxes to include a mandatory
temporary exception from recognizing deferred taxes relating to Pillar Two. The Group has applied this mandatory exception which did not have a material
impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1
            On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted the amendment to IAS 1 ("IAS 1 Amendment") which provides guidance and examples to help entities
apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful
by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their “significant” accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their “material” accounting policies
and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The adoption of IAS 1
Amendment did not have a material impact on the accounting policy disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
              There are no other new IFRS or IFRS Interpretation Committee ("IFRIC") interpretations effective as of January 1, 2023 that have a material
impact to the consolidated financial statements.

New standards and interpretations issued not yet effective

Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1
             In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to specify the requirements for
classifying liabilities as current or non-current. In November 2022, the IASB issued further amendments delaying the effective date to annual reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. The amendments will require the Group to
reclassify the Exchangeable Notes (as defined below) as a current liability if the exchange conditions are met, even if no noteholder actually requires us to
exchange their notes. Adoption of this amendment would not result in the reclassification of the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability at any reporting date,
from the inception of the Exchangeable Notes to December 31, 2023, as the exchange conditions had not been met.



                                                                               F-20

             There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material impact to the consolidated
financial statements.


3. Critical accounting estimates and judgments
            The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. Estimates and
judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events.
                Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or
liabilities affected in future periods.
             The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are:
                (i)     Revenue Recognition: Multiple Performance Obligations - The Group's contracts with customers for the Premium Service in select
                        markets include promises to transfer more than one service. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct
                        performance obligations. In such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated between the obligations according to their relative
                        stand-alone selling prices; where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used. See Note 2.
                (ii)    Share-based compensation - The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and directors by reference to the
                        fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The assumptions and models used for estimating the fair value
                        of share-based compensation transactions are disclosed in Note 18. The Group also estimates a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based
                        compensation expense for the awards. The forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of actual forfeitures.
                (iii)   Deferred taxes - The Group has recognized deferred tax assets for tax loss carry-forwards, tax credits and deductible temporary
                        differences. The Group also has significant unrecognized deferred tax assets. At period end, we assess whether there is convincing
                        evidence that the Group will generate future taxable income against which deferred tax assets can be utilized and, thus, that recovery is
                        probable. See Note 9.
                (iv)    Goodwill impairment - In accordance with the accounting policy described in Note 2, the Group annually performs an impairment test
                        regarding goodwill. The assumptions used for estimating fair value and assessing available headroom based on conditions that existed at
                        the testing date are disclosed in Note 13.
                (v)     Content - The Group’s agreements and arrangements with rights holders for the content used on its platform are complex. Some rights
                        holders have allowed the use of their content on the platform while negotiations of the terms and conditions or determination of statutory
                        rates are ongoing. In certain jurisdictions, rights holders have several years to claim royalties for musical composition, and therefore,
                        estimates of the royalty accruals are based on available information and historical trends. The determination of royalty accruals requires
                        complex IT systems and a significant volume of data, as well as significant judgements, assumptions, and estimates of the amounts to be
                        paid. See Note 21. Additionally, the economic life and expected amortization profile of podcast content assets is estimated by
                        management based on historical listening patterns and is evaluated on an ongoing basis. See Note 2 and Note 16.
                (vi)    Provisions - Management makes significant assumptions and estimates when determining the amounts to record for provision for legal
                        contingencies. See Note 22.
                (vii) Business combinations - In business combinations, the Group allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets
                      acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase
                      consideration over the fair values of these identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to
                      make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, especially with respect to intangible assets. See Note 5.
                (viii) Leases - As most of the Group's lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate of return, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate
                       based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The Group's
                       incremental borrowing rate is determined based on estimates and judgments, including the credit rating of the Group's leasing entities
                       and a credit spread. See Note 2 and Note 11.



                                                                               F-21
Table of Contents



                 (ix)   Impairment of real estate assets - Management makes significant assumptions and estimates when determining the non-cash impairment
                        charges for our real estate assets, which include lease right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements and property and equipment. See Note
                        11 and Note 12.
                 (x)    Exchangeable Notes and warrants - the fair value of the Group's Exchangeable Notes and warrants are estimated using valuation
                        techniques and inputs based on management's judgment and conditions that exist at each reporting date. See Note 23.
                 (xi)   Uncertain tax positions - In determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, the Group takes into account the impact of
                        uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes, interest or penalties may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and
                        assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to
                        change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities. Such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the
                        period that such a determination is made. See Note 9.


4.      Revenue recognition

Revenue from contracts with customers

(i)            Disaggregated revenue
               The Group discloses revenue by reportable segment and geographic area in Note 24.

(ii)           Performance obligations
             The Group discloses its policies for how it identifies, satisfies, and recognizes its performance obligations associated with its contracts with
customers in Note 2.

(iii)          Contract liabilities
              The Group’s contract liabilities from contracts with customers consist primarily of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is mainly comprised of
subscription fees collected for services not yet performed, and therefore, the revenue has not been recognized. Revenue is recognized over time as the services
are performed. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Group had deferred revenue of €622 million and €520 million, respectively. The increase in deferred
revenue in 2023 is primarily a result of an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers as well as price increases. This balance will be recognized as
revenue as the services are performed, which is generally expected to occur over a period of up to a year.
             Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is
€504 million, €448 million, and €372 million, respectively.


5.      Business combinations
             The following sections describe the Group’s material acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no acquisitions during
the year ended December 31, 2023.

Sonantic
            On July 11, 2022, the Group acquired 100% of Sonantic Limited ("Sonantic"), an artificial intelligence voice platform. This acquisition allows the
Group to expand text-to-speech capabilities across the Group's platform.
             The fair value of the purchase consideration was €93 million in cash, paid at closing. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition
method. Of the total purchase consideration, €64 million has been recorded to goodwill, €31 million to acquired intangible assets, €2 million to cash and cash
equivalents and €4 million to deferred tax liabilities. The Group incurred €2 million in acquisition-related costs that were recognized as general and
administrative expenses.
              The goodwill represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate
recognition, including expected future synergies and the technical expertise of the acquired workforce. None of the goodwill recorded is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. €48 million of goodwill was allocated to the Premium segment, and €16 million of goodwill was allocated to the Ad-Supported
segment.
             The intangible asset acquired relates to existing technology. The useful life of the existing technology is five years. The Group valued the existing
technology using the replacement cost method under the cost approach.



                                                                               F-22
Table of Contents



              In addition to the purchase consideration, there are cash payments of €30 million that are contingent on the continued employment of certain
employees. In addition, €4 million of equity instruments were offered to and accepted by certain employees, which have vesting conditions contingent upon
continued employment and are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation transactions. These cash payments and share-based compensation
transactions are recognized as post-combination expense over employment service periods of up to four years, if not forfeited by the employees.

Findaway

             On June 15, 2022, the Group acquired 100% of Findaway World, LLC (“Findaway”), a digital audiobook distribution platform. The acquisition
allows the Group to accelerate its audiobook content offering.
            The fair value of the purchase consideration was €117 million in cash, paid at closing. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition
method. The purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition are as follows:

                                                                                                                                                 (in € millions)
Cash and cash equivalents                                                                                                                                            8
Trade and other receivables                                                                                                                                         11
Other current assets                                                                                                                                                15
Intangible assets                                                                                                                                                   22
Trade and other payables                                                                                                                                           (11)
Accrued expenses and other liabilities                                                                                                                             (13)
Total identifiable net assets                                                                                                                                       32
Goodwill                                                                                                                                                            85
Fair value of net assets acquired                                                                                                                                  117

             The Group incurred €5 million in acquisition-related costs that were recognized as general and administrative expenses.
              The goodwill represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate
recognition, including expected future synergies and the technical expertise of the acquired workforce. The goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes. The goodwill was allocated to the Premium segment.
              The intangible assets acquired relate to existing technology, trade name and publisher relationships. The useful lives of the existing technology
and trade name are five years each, and the useful life of the publisher relationships is seven years. The Group valued the existing technology and trade name
using the relief from royalty method, under the income approach. The Group valued the publisher relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method,
under the income approach.
              In addition to the purchase consideration, there are cash payments of €13 million that are contingent on the continued employment of certain
employees. In addition, €5 million of equity instruments were offered to and accepted by certain employees, which have vesting conditions contingent upon
continued employment and are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation transactions. These cash payments and share-based compensation
transactions are recognized as post-combination expense over employment service periods of up to four years, if not forfeited by the employees.

Podsights and Chartable
              During February 2022, the Group acquired 100% of In Defense of Growth Inc. ("Podsights") and Chartable Holding, Inc. ("Chartable") to provide
improved podcast ad measurement and analytics services. These acquisitions allow the Group to expand and scale its podcast monetization and product
offering for advertisers and publishers.
              The combined fair value of the purchase consideration for the two acquisitions was €83 million in cash, paid at closing. The acquisitions were
accounted for under the acquisition method. Of the total purchase consideration, €59 million has been recorded to goodwill, €26 million to acquired intangible
assets, €4 million to cash and cash equivalents, €1 million to other tangible net assets, and €7 million to deferred tax liabilities. The Group incurred €2 million
in acquisition-related costs, which were recognized as general and administrative expenses.
              The goodwill represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate
recognition, including expected future synergies and technical expertise of the acquired workforce.



                                                                               F-23
Table of Contents



None of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was allocated to the Ad-Supported segment.
               The intangible assets acquired relate to existing technology and customer relationships. The useful lives of existing technology ranges from three
to five years, and the useful life of customer relationships is one year. The Group valued the existing technology using the multi-period excess earnings and
replacement cost methods, under the income approach and cost approach, respectively. The Group valued the customer relationships using the replacement cost
method, under the cost approach.
              In addition to the purchase consideration, there are cash payments of €21 million that are contingent on the continued employment of certain
employees. In addition, €10 million of equity instruments were offered to and accepted by certain employees, which have vesting conditions contingent on
continued employment and are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation transactions. These cash payments and share-based compensation
transactions are recognized as post-combination expense over employment service periods of up to four years, if not forfeited by the employees.
             The amount for business combinations, net of cash acquired, within the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2022 includes €11 million of investing cash outflows for deferred consideration of previous business combinations.

liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

              Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of the following items, because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which entities within the Group can realize the benefits.

              At December 31, 2023, no deferred tax liability had been recognized on investments in subsidiaries because the Company has concluded it has
the ability and intention to control the timing of any distribution from its subsidiaries. There are no distributions planned in the foreseeable future. It is not
practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on investments in subsidiaries.
             Tax losses and credit carry-forwards as at December 31, 2023 were expected to expire as follows:

              The Group has significant net operating loss carry-forwards in Luxembourg of €90 million, as well as foreign jurisdictions including the United
States of €318 million (€44 million federal and €274 million state and local), Sweden of €1,483 million, India of €117 million and other foreign jurisdictions of
€22 million. In certain jurisdictions, if the Group is unable to earn sufficient income or profits to utilize such carry-forwards before they expire, they will no
longer be available to offset future income or profits.
              In the United States, of the €44 million federal net operating loss carryforwards, €13 million are subject to an annual limitation as defined by
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 382”). The remaining balance is related to net operating losses generated after January 1, 2018 which can
be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to an 80% taxable income limitation upon utilization. In addition, utilization of these net operating loss carry-
forwards may be subject to further annual limitation if there is an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. Such an ownership change may limit
the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income.
              In Sweden, our net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a
substantial annual limitation if there is an ownership change within the meaning of Chapter 40, paragraphs 10-14, of the Swedish Income Tax Act (the
“Swedish Income Tax Act”).
              The Group’s most significant tax jurisdictions are Sweden and the U.S. (both at the federal level and in various state jurisdictions). In the U.S., tax
years beginning in or after 2013 and 2014 remain open to tax authority examinations at the state and federal level, respectively. In Sweden, tax years beginning
in or after 2018 remain open to adjustment. U.S. tax loss and tax credit carry-forwards generated in periods prior to 2014 remain open to adjustment through
the end of the statute of limitations related to the year the carryforward is used to offset taxable income. Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries are currently under
examination by national, and in the case of the U.S. national and state level, tax authorities for tax years from 2013-2021. These examinations may lead to
adjustments to the Group’s taxes.
              The Group has initiated and is in negotiations for an Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) between Sweden and the United States governments
for the tax years including 2014 through 2020 covering various transfer pricing matters. The resolution of tax examinations and the APA may be significant to
the consolidated financial statements.
              The Group is in scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules (“the P2 Model Rules” or “P2 Rules”). To come into force, the P2 Model Rules must
be enacted into local tax legislation by each country. The P2 Rules have been enacted (or substantively enacted) in certain jurisdictions in which the Group
operates, including Luxembourg and Sweden. The legislation

will be effective for the Group’s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The rules will impose a minimum 15% effective tax rate, based on the P2 Rules,
applicable in each jurisdiction in which the Group operates.
              The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is in process, based on the most recently available financial information
including relevant tax filings for members of the Group.
               Based on our work to date, we have identified uncertainties, specifically with respect to the most material jurisdictions in which Spotify operates.
These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in the Pillar Two guidelines and legislation as well as 2024 financial performance of our Group
companies. The Group expects that transitional safe harbor relief should apply in the majority of the other subsidiary jurisdictions based on an analysis of prior
year results, however, such calculations must be updated in 2024 to validate the application of the safe harbor rules.
              Material Pillar Two impacts to our tax expense remain possible. There are significant complexities inherent in applying the legislation and
performing the Pillar Two calculations, therefore the quantitative impact of the P2 Model Rules is not reasonably estimable at this time. In addition,
quantitative information to indicate potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is not currently known or reasonably estimable. The Group continues to
progress on the assessment and expects to complete the assessment in the 2024 financial year.
               In May 2023, the IASB amended IAS 12 Income Taxes to include a mandatory temporary exception from recognizing or disclosing deferred taxes
relating to the Pillar Two legislation. The Group has applied this mandatory exception which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial
statements.


10.   Loss per share
              Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares during the period. Diluted loss per share is
computed using the treasury stock method to the extent that the effect is dilutive by using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares and
potential outstanding ordinary shares during the period. Potential ordinary shares, which are based on the weighted-average ordinary shares underlying
outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares, warrants, and Exchangeable Notes and computed using the treasury
stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted loss per share when their effect is dilutive. The computation of
loss per share for the respective periods is as follows:

           Impairment of real estate assets
            During the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of our Work From Anywhere program and a comprehensive review of our real estate footprint
and space utilization trends (collectively, the "Office Space Optimization Initiative"), we made the strategic decision to reduce our real estate footprint in
certain locations and initiate subleases of these leased office spaces. In accordance with IAS 36, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge to write-down
the related real estate assets, which included lease right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements and property and equipment to their recoverable amounts.
            To determine the recoverable amounts of these real estate assets, we utilized discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value less cost of
disposal. The development of discounted cash flow models required the application of level 3 inputs and significant judgment in determining market participant
assumptions, including the projected sublease income over the remaining lease terms, expected vacancy periods prior to the commencement of future
subleases, expected lease incentives offered to future tenants, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with these future cash flows.
           The key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amounts of real estate assets were the sublease rental rates, vacancy periods and pre-tax
discount rates, which were determined based on the nature and geographic locations of each office



                                                                             F-29

space that we planned to sublease. A change in the sublease rental rate, vacancy period, or discount rate assumptions may result in a recoverable amount of one
or more of these assets that is above or below the current carrying amount and, therefore, there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in a future period.
We consider that reasonably possible changes in the sublease rental rates, vacancy periods, or discount rates arising from changes in the real estate markets of
the office leases could result in a change in their carrying amounts. A decrease or increase of 10% in the sublease rental rates would have resulted in a change
to the impairment loss of €9 million at December 31, 2023. A decrease or increase of six months in the vacancy periods would have resulted in a change to the
impairment loss of €7 million at December 31, 2023. A decrease or increase of 100 basis points in the discount rates would have resulted in a change to the
impairment loss of €4 million at December 31, 2023.
           For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded €74 million of impairment charges for lease right-of-use assets in connection with the Office
Space Optimization Initiative. See Note 12 for information regarding impairment charges related to property and equipment assets. These charges are included
in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as follows.

in research and development in the consolidated statement of operations. There were no impairment charges for goodwill in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
We recorded immaterial impairment charges for intangible assets in 2023 and 2022. There were no impairment charges for intangible assets in 2021.
             Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to
the Group’s two operating segments, Premium and Ad-Supported, based on each of the segments that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The Group monitors goodwill at the operating segment level for internal purposes, consistent with the way it assesses performance and allocates resources. The
carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the operating segments is as follows:
                                                                                         Premium             Ad-Supported              Premium         Ad-Supported

             Valuation methodology
              The Group performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2023. The recoverable amount of the Premium and Ad-Supported
operating segments are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) model. The FVLCD valuation is considered a level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy, as it uses significant unobservable inputs. FVLCD is calculated using both the income and market valuation methods.



                                                                                  F-33

              Ad-Supported segment
              For the Ad-supported segment we used an income valuation method which involved discounting the projected cash flows to present value. We
also used the Venture Capital method ("VC method") which is a hybrid of the income and market valuation methods. The VC method involved discounting
cash flows and then applying observed market multiples of comparable publicly traded companies to the forecasted revenue based on an assumed future exit
date within the forecast period. We weighted the income valuation method and VC method 50% and 50%, respectively.

              Premium segment
             For the Premium segment we used an income valuation method which involved discounting the projected cash flows to present value. We also
used the market valuation method which involved applying multiples from comparable publicly traded companies to the revenue of the preceding and
forecasted 12 months, before and after the date of the impairment test, respectively. We weighted the income valuation method and market valuation method
50% and 50%, respectively.
              As a result of the analysis, the FVLCD for the Premium and Ad-Supported operating segments was determined to be in excess of their carrying
amounts.

              Key assumptions used in the FVLCD calculations at the impairment testing date
             The key assumptions used in the income approach was the discount rate based on the weighted-average cost of capital. The discount rate was
11.0% and 12.5% for the Group’s Premium and Ad-Supported segments, respectively. The key assumptions used in the VC method and market valuation
method were the revenue multiples for comparable companies, which were selected based on industry similarity, financial risk, and size of each of the Group’s
operating segments. For the Ad-supported segment, we applied a revenue multiple of 2.7 to the forecasted 12 months revenue preceding the assumed exit date.
For the Premium segment, we applied a revenue multiple of 3.0 and 2.9 to the preceding and forecasted 12 months revenue before and after the date of the
impairment test, respectively.
             There are no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions that would result in the operating segments’ carrying amounts exceeding their
recoverable amounts.

18.   Share-based compensation
Stock Option Plans
               During 2020 and 2021, the Company implemented new Employee Stock Option Plans (“ESOP”) and Director Stock Option Plans (together, the
“Stock Options Plans”). Under the Stock Option Plans, stock options of the Company are granted to certain employees of the Group and members of its board
of directors. For options granted under the Stock Option Plans, the exercise price is equal to the fair value of the ordinary shares on grant date or equal to 150%
of the fair value of the ordinary shares on grant date. The exercise price is included in the grant date fair value of the award. The exercise price for options is
payable in the EUR value of a fixed USD amount; therefore, the Group considers these options to be USD-denominated. The options granted to participants
under the Stock Option Plans have a first vesting period of three or eight months from date of grant and vest monthly or annually thereafter until fully vested.
The options are granted with a term of five years.

Restricted Stock Unit Program
              During 2020 and 2021, the Company implemented new restricted stock unit (“RSU”) programs for employees and for members of its board of
directors (together, the “RSU Plans”). The RSU Plans are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation transactions. The RSUs are measured based
on the fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date of grant. The RSUs granted to participants under the RSU Plans have a first vesting
period of three or eight months from date of grant and vest monthly or annually thereafter until fully vested four years from date of grant. The valuation of the
RSUs was consistent with the fair value of the ordinary shares.

Other Awards
              In connection with the acquisition of Anchor during 2019 and The Ringer during 2020, the Company granted 162,320 and 34,450 equity
instruments to certain employees of Anchor and The Ringer, respectively. Each instrument effectively represents one ordinary share of the Company, which
will be issued to the holder upon vesting. The instruments vest annually over a four-year and five-year period, respectively, from the acquisition date, and
vesting of the instruments is contingent on continued employment. The instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation transactions
and are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of each equity instrument
granted to certain employees of Anchor and The Ringer was US $145.21 and US $145.14, respectively.
              In connection with the acquisition of Podsights during 2022, the Company granted 30,824 equity instruments to certain employees of Podsights.
The instruments vest annually over a four-year period from the acquisition date and the vesting is contingent upon continued employment. The instruments are
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions and are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date
of grant. The grant date fair value for each equity instrument granted to employees of Podsights was US $162.21.

              In the table above, the number of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares released include ordinary shares that the Group has withheld for
settlement of employees’ tax obligations due upon the vesting of RSUs. For most of our employees, when RSUs vest, the Group withholds the number of
shares that are equal to the monetary value of the employee’s tax obligation from the total number of shares that otherwise would have been issued. The Group
then remits cash to tax authorities on the employees' behalf. If all the RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2023 subsequently vest, the Group estimates that it
would be required to remit approximately €175 million to tax authorities over the vesting period for the years 2024 through 2027. In determining this estimate,
the Group used the Company's ordinary share price as at December 31, 2023. The actual amount remitted to tax authorities is dependent on the Company's
ordinary share price on each of the vesting dates as well as the number of awards that ultimately vest.

             In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the near future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The expected volatility is
based on a weighting of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock and the historical volatility of public companies that are comparable to the
Group over the expected term of the award. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon rates as the exercise price is based on a fixed USD
amount. The expected life of the stock options is based on historical data and current expectations.
            The following table lists the inputs to the Black-Scholes option-pricing models used for stock options for the years ended December 31, 2023,
2022, and 2021:

             Valuation assumptions are determined at each grant date and, as a result, are likely to change for share-based awards granted in future periods.
Changes to the input assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of share-based compensation awards.
             The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of increasing and decreasing expected volatility by 10%, as well as the impact of increasing and
decreasing the expected life by one year. This analysis was performed on stock options granted in 2023. The following table shows the impact of these changes
on stock option expense for the options granted in 2023:

             On March 2, 2021, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Spotify USA Inc. (the “Issuer”), issued US $1,500 million aggregate principal
amount of 0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”), which included the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to
purchase an additional US $200 million principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier
repurchased, redeemed or exchanged. The Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis by the Company.
              The net proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting transaction costs of €18 million. The
transaction costs were immediately expensed and included in finance costs in the consolidated statement of operations.
               The Exchangeable Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with the Issuer's future senior, unsecured
indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Exchangeable Notes and effectively
subordinated to the Issuer’s future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Exchangeable Notes will be
structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Issuer is not a holder thereof) preferred
equity, if any, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.



                                                                                 F-41

              The noteholders may exchange their Exchangeable Notes at their option into consideration that consists, at the Issuer’s election, of cash, ordinary
shares of the Company, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, but only in the following circumstances:
               (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per ordinary share
              exceeds 130% of the exchange price for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last
              trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
              (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period (such 10 consecutive trading day period,
              the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes for each trading day of the
              measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per ordinary share on such trading day and the exchange rate
              on such trading day;
              (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the ordinary shares as set forth in the indenture governing the
              Exchangeable Notes (the “Indenture”);
              (4) if the Issuer calls such Exchangeable Notes for redemption; and
              (5) at any time from, and including, December 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the
              maturity date.
              The initial exchange rate is 1.9410 ordinary shares per US $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes, which represents an initial exchange
price of approximately US $515.20 per ordinary share. The exchange rate and exchange price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of
certain events as set forth in the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur as set forth in the
Indenture, then the exchange rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.
              The circumstances required to allow the noteholders to exchange their Exchangeable Notes were not met during the year ended December 31,
2023.
             The Exchangeable Notes will not be redeemable prior to March 20, 2024, except in the event of certain tax law changes as set forth in the
Indenture. The Exchangeable Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Issuer’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20,
2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the
Exchangeable Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per ordinary share
exceeds 130% of the exchange price on:
              (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day
              immediately before the date the Issuer sends the related redemption notice; and
              (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends such notice.
             In addition, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Exchangeable Notes if certain changes in tax law as set forth in
the Indenture occur. In addition, calling any Exchangeable Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that
Exchangeable Note, in which case the exchange rate applicable to the exchange of that Exchangeable Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is
exchanged after it is called for redemption.
               Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” as set forth in the Indenture, noteholders may require the Issuer to repurchase their Exchangeable
Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date as set forth in the Indenture.
              The Group accounted for the Exchangeable Notes at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS 9,
Financial Instruments. Under this approach, the Exchangeable Notes are accounted for in their entirety at fair value, with any change in fair value after initial
measurement being recorded in finance income or cost in the consolidated statement of operations, except that changes in fair value that are due to changes in
own credit risk are presented separately in other comprehensive (loss)/income and will not be reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations.
            The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes as of December 31, 2023 was €1,203 million. See Note 23 for information regarding the key inputs and
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes.

Legal contingencies
              Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. The results of such legal
proceedings are difficult to predict, and the extent of the Group’s financial exposure is difficult to estimate. The Group records a provision for contingent losses
when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
                As of April 2019, the Group's settlement of the Ferrick et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 1:16-cv-8412-AJN (S.D.N.Y.), putative class action lawsuit,
which alleged that the Group unlawfully reproduced and distributed musical compositions without obtaining licenses, was final and effective. Even with the
effectiveness of the settlement, we may still be subject to claims of copyright infringement by rights holders who have purported to opt out of the settlement or
who may not otherwise be covered by its terms. The Music Modernization Act of 2018 contains a limitation of liability with respect to such lawsuits filed on or
after January 1, 2018. Rights holders may, nevertheless, file lawsuits, and may argue that they should not be bound by this limitation of liability. For example,
in August 2019, the Eight Mile Style, LLC et al v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 3:19-cv-00736-AAT, lawsuit was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Tennessee, alleging both that the Group does not qualify for the limitation of liability in the Music Modernization Act and that the limitation
of liability is unconstitutional and, thus, not valid law. The Group intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit, including plaintiffs' challenges to the limitation of
liability in the Music Modernization Act.

Indirect tax
             The Group has indirect tax provisions that relate primarily to potential non-income tax obligations in various jurisdictions. The Group recognizes
provisions for claims or indirect taxes when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.



                                                                                   F-44

Onerous contracts

               Onerous contracts represent contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations exceeds the expected revenue.

Other
               The Group has obligations under lease agreements to return the leased assets to their original condition. An obligation to return the leased asset to
their original condition upon expiration of the lease is accounted for as asset retirement obligations. The obligations are expected to be settled at the end of the
lease terms.


23. Financial risk management and financial instruments
Financial risk management
              The Group’s operations are exposed to financial risks. To manage these risks efficiently, the Group has established guidelines in the form of a
treasury policy that serves as a framework for the daily financial operations. The treasury policy stipulates the rules and limitations for the management of
financial risks.
              Financial risk management is centralized within Treasury which is responsible for the management of financial risks. Treasury manages and
executes the financial management activities, including monitoring the exposure of financial risks, cash management, and maintaining a liquidity reserve.
Treasury operates within the limits and policies authorized by the board of directors.

Capital management
              The Group’s objectives when managing capital (cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, Exchangeable Notes, and equity) is to
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce
the cost of capital. The Group’s capital structure and dividend policy is decided by the board of directors. Treasury continuously reviews the Group’s capital
structure considering, amongst other things, market conditions, financial flexibility, business risk, and growth rate. We have never declared or paid any cash
dividends on our share capital, and we do not expect to pay dividends or other distributions on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future.
             On November 5, 2018, the Company announced a share repurchase program beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 which expired on April 21,
2021. The total aggregate amount of repurchased shares under that program was 4,366,427 for a total of approximately €510 million.
             On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the
Company’s ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares were authorized at the Company’s general meeting of
shareholders on April 21, 2021. The repurchase program will expire on April 21, 2026. An aggregate of 469,274 ordinary shares for €91 million has been
repurchased since the commencement of the share repurchase program through December 31, 2023.
              The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and
alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program is executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to
grow the business over the long term. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares, and the
repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company uses current cash and cash equivalents and the
cash flow it generates from operations to fund the share repurchase program.

             The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Credit risk management
                Financial assets with respect to cash and cash equivalents and short term investments carry an element of risk that counterparties may be unable to
fulfill their obligations. This exposure arises from the investments in liquid funds of banks and other counterparties. The Group mitigates this risk by adopting a
risk averse approach in relation to the investment of surplus cash. The main objectives for investments are first, to preserve principal and secondarily, to
maximize return given the rules and limitations of the treasury policy. Surplus cash is invested in counterparties and instruments considered to carry low credit
risk. Investments are subject to credit rating thresholds and, at the time of investment, no more than 10% of surplus cash can be invested in any one issuer
(excluding certain government bonds and investments in cash management banks). The weighted-average maturity of the portfolio shall not be greater than 2
years, and the final maturity of any investment is not to exceed 5



                                                                               F-45

years. The Group shall maintain the ability to liquidate the majority of all investments (classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments)
within 90 days. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the financial credit risk was equal to the consolidated statement of financial position value of cash and cash
equivalents and short term investments of €4,214 million and €3,350 million, respectively. No credit losses were incurred during 2023 or 2022 on these
investments.
              The credit risk with respect to the Group’s trade receivables is diversified geographically and among a large number of customers, private
individuals, as well as companies in various industries, both public and private. The majority of the Group’s revenue is paid monthly in advance significantly
lowering the credit risk incurred for these specific counterparties. Solvency information is generally required for credit sales within the Ad sales and Partner
subscription business to minimize the risk of bad debt losses and is based on information provided by credit and business information from external sources.

Liquidity risk management
               Liquidity risk is the Group’s risk of not being able to meet the short term payment obligations due to insufficient funds. The Group has internal
control processes and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk. A centralized cash pooling process enables the Group to manage liquidity surpluses and
deficits according to the actual needs at the group and subsidiary level. The liquidity management takes into account the maturities of financial assets and
financial liabilities and estimates of cash flows from operations.

             The Group’s policy is to have a strong liquidity position in terms of available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments.
                                                                                                                                  2023                      2022

             Cash equivalents include investments in money market funds measured at fair value and classified as level 1 financial instruments in the fair
value hierarchy.

Currency risk management
              Transaction exposure relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by operations (purchasing and selling) and/or
financing (interest and amortization). The Group’s general policy is to hedge a portion of its transaction exposure on a case-by-case basis under the Group’s
cash-flow hedging program by entering into multiple foreign exchange forward contracts. The Group does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts
greater than one year. The Group’s currency pairs used for cash flow hedges are Euro / U.S. dollar, Euro / Australian dollar, Euro / British pound, Euro /
Swedish krona, Euro / Canadian dollar, and Euro / Norwegian krone. Translation exposure relates to net investments in foreign operations. The Group does not
conduct translation risk hedging.

                (i)             Transaction exposure sensitivity
             In most cases, the Group’s customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental
             fees are settled in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily in EUR and USD. Hence, the operational need to net purchase foreign
             currency is due primarily to a deficit from such settlements.
             The table below shows the immediate impact on net income/loss before tax of a 10% strengthening in the closing exchange rate of significant
             currencies to which the Group had exposure at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The impact on net income/loss before tax is due primarily to
             monetary assets and liabilities in a transactional currency other than the functional currency of a subsidiary within the Group. The sensitivity
             associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.

                  (ii)          Translation exposure sensitivity
             Translation exposure exists due to the translation of the results and financial position of all of the Group entities that have a functional currency
             different from the presentation currency of Euro. The impact on the Group’s equity would be approximately €127 million and €140 million if the
             Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on the exposure at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Interest rate risk management
               Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on the Group’s earnings and cash flow. The Group’s exposure
to interest rate risk is related to its interest-bearing assets, including its cash and cash equivalents and debt securities held at fair value through other
comprehensive income. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield of the investment. The sensitivity analysis considered the historical volatility of short
term interest rates and we determined that it was reasonably possible that a change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical
100 basis points increase in interest rates would have impacted interest income by €40 million and €36 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively.

Financing risk management
              The Group finances its operations through external borrowings, equity offerings, and cash flow from operations. The funding strategy has been to
diversify funding sources. The external debt consisted of the Exchangeable Notes and lease liabilities.

Share price risk management
           Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the
Company’s ordinary share price. The Group’s exposure to this risk relates primarily to the outstanding Exchangeable Notes and warrants.
              Both the Exchangeable Notes and the warrants are re-measured at each reporting date using valuation models using input data based on the
Company’s share price. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in finance income or cost. All else being equal, an increase or decrease of
share price will increase or decrease the value of both the Exchangeable Notes and the warrants. The Group has not entered into any hedging arrangement to
mitigate these fluctuations.

Other share price risk
              Social costs are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation that the Group is subject to in
various countries in which the Group operates. Social costs are accrued at each reporting period based on the number of vested stock options and awards
outstanding, the exercise price, and the Company's share price. Changes in the accrual are recognized in operating expenses. An increase in share price will
increase the accrued expense for social costs, and when the share price decreases, the accrued expense will become a reduction in social costs expense, all other
things being equal, including the number of vested stock options and exercise price remaining constant. A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary
share price would have resulted in a change in the accrual for social costs on outstanding share-based compensation awards ranging from €17 million to €18
million at December 31, 2023, and a change of €1 million at December 31, 2022.

Investment risk
              The Group is exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its long term investments, due primarily to volatility in the
share price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of the Group’s long term investments relate to TME.

             The Group’s policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of each reporting period. During the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.


Recurring fair value measurements

Long term investment – Tencent Music Entertainment Group
              The Group’s approximate 8% investment in TME is carried at fair value through other comprehensive income/(loss). The fair value of ordinary
shares of TME is based on the ending New York Stock Exchange American depository share price. The fair value of the investment in TME may vary over
time and is subject to a variety of risks including: company performance, macro-economic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate, and systemic risks
of the equity markets overall.
             The table below presents the changes in the investment in TME:
                                                                                                             2023                 2022                 2021

             A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from
€1,039 million to €1,270 million at December 31, 2023 and €985 million to €1,204 million at December 31, 2022.
              The following sections describe the valuation methodologies the Group uses to measure its Level 3 financial instruments at fair value on a
recurring basis.

Warrants
              On July 1, 2019, the Company sold, for €15 million, warrants to acquire 800,000 ordinary shares to Mr. Ek, through D.G.E. Investments Limited,
an entity indirectly wholly owned by him. The exercise price of each warrant is US $190.09, which was equal to 1.3 times the fair market value of ordinary
shares on the date of issuance. On July 1, 2022 the warrants expired unexercised. Refer to Note 26.
             On August 23, 2021, the Company issued, for €31 million, warrants to acquire 800,000 ordinary shares to Mr. Ek, through D.G.E. Investments
Limited, an entity indirectly wholly owned by him. The exercise price of each warrant is US $281.63, which was equal to 1.3 times the fair market value of
ordinary shares on the date of issuance. The warrants are exercisable at any time through August 23, 2024. Refer to Note 26.
              The outstanding warrants are measured on a recurring basis in the consolidated statement of financial position and are Level 3 financial
instruments recognized at fair value through the consolidated statement of operations. The warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
which includes inputs determined from models that include the value of the Company’s ordinary shares, as determined above and additional assumptions used
to estimate the fair value of the warrants in the option pricing model as follows:
                                                                                                             2023                 2022                 2021

            The warrant liability is included in derivative liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position. The change in estimated fair value is
recognized within finance income or costs in the consolidated statement of operations.
              A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the warrants ranging from €2 million to
€6 million at December 31, 2023 and €1 million to €2 million at December 31, 2022.

Long term investments – other
             The Group has interests in certain long term investments, the most significant of which is our equity investment in DK Holdco, LLC
("DistroKid"), an independent digital music distribution service. These long term investments primarily represent unlisted equity securities carried at fair value
through other comprehensive income/(loss). The fair values of these equity investments are generally determined using business enterprise values based on
market transactions or by (i) applying market multiples to the projected financial performance and (ii) discounting the future value to its present value
equivalent. The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these equity investments include market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies used to estimate business enterprise value and discount rate.
           The fair value of the long term investments may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including: company performance,
macroeconomic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate, and systemic risks of the overall equity markets.
             The table below presents the changes in the other long term investments:

              The change in estimated fair value is recognized within finance (costs)/income in the consolidated statement of operations, excluding changes in
fair value due to changes in the Group’s own credit risk, which are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and will not be reclassified to the
consolidated statement of operations.
            The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was estimated using a combination of a binomial option pricing model and prices observed for the
Exchangeable Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period. A weight of 75% was applied to the binomial option pricing
model and a weight of 25% was applied to the price of the Exchangeable Notes in the over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period.
The key assumptions used in the binomial option pricing model for the Exchangeable Notes were as follows:

                                                                                                                          2023                        2022
Risk free rate (%)                                                                                                                  4.18                       4.2
Discount rate (%)                                                                                                                    6.5                       7.0
Volatility (%)                                                                                                                      45.0                      45.0
Share price (US$)                                                                                                                 187.91                     78.95

              A decrease or increase of 10 percentage points in volatility would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,192
million to €1,219 million at December 31, 2023. A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the
Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,197 million to €1,210 million at December 31, 2023. A decrease or increase of 100 basis points in credit spread would
have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,221 million to €1,185 million at December 31, 2023.


24.   Segment information
              The Group has two reportable segments: Premium and Ad-Supported. Revenue for the Premium segment is generated primarily through
subscription fees. Revenue for the Ad-Supported segment is primarily generated through the sale of advertising across the Group's music and podcast content.
Royalty costs are primarily recorded in each segment based on specific rates for each segment agreed to with rights holders. All podcast content costs are
recorded in the Ad-Supported segment. The costs of providing audiobook content as part of the Premium subscription are recorded in the Premium segment.
The remaining costs that are not specifically associated to either of the segments are allocated based on user activity or the revenue recognized in each segment.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.
             Key financial performance measures of the segments including revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit are as follows:

Reconciliation of segment gross profit
             Operating expenses, finance income, and finance costs are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an overall Group basis.
The reconciliation between reportable segment gross profit to the Group’s (loss)/income before tax is as follows:

Contingencies
              Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. These may include, but are not
limited to, matters relating to intellectual property, data protection, consumer protection, employment, and contractual rights. As a general matter, the music and
other content made available on the Group’s Service are licensed to the Group by various third parties. Many of these licenses allow rights holders or other
authorized parties to audit the Group’s royalty payments, and any such audit could result in disputes over whether the Group has paid the proper royalties. If
such a dispute were to occur, the Group could be required to pay additional royalties, and the amounts involved could be material. The Group expenses legal
fees as incurred. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Group’s operations or its financial
position, liquidity, or results of operations.

                                                 PAGE 2
         5.3. The Board of Directors is authorized to sub-delegate to one of the Company’s Directors or officer of the
Company or to any other duly authorized person, during a period ending five (5) years from the date of the
extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on March 29, 2023, (i) to realise any increase of the corporate
capital within the limits of the authorized capital in one or several successive tranches, by the issue of new ordinary
shares, with or without share premium, in consideration for a payment in cash or in kind (a) following the exercise of
subscription rights and/or (b) following the exercise of conversion rights granted by the Board of Directors under the
terms of warrants (which may be separate or attached to ordinary shares, notes or similar instruments), convertible
notes or similar instruments issued from time to time by the Company, (c) by conversion of claims or (d) in any other
manner; (ii) to determine the place and date of the issue, the issue price, the terms and conditions of the subscription
and the payment of the newly issued ordinary shares; and (iii) to withdraw or restrict the preferential subscription
right of the shareholders..
         5.d.    The ordinary shares may be issued above, at, or below market value, but in any event not below the
nominal value or below the accounting par value per ordinary share.
         Article 6.- Shares
         6.1.    The ordinary shares are and shall remain in registered form only.
         6.2.    No fractional ordinary share shall be issued or exist at any time. The Board of Directors shall however
be authorized to provide at its discretion for the payment in cash in lieu of any fraction of an ordinary share of the
Company.
         6.3.    Ordinary shares may be held in trust by one or several shareholders.
         6.4.    A register of shareholders will be kept by the Company at its registered office, where it will be
available for inspection by any shareholder. This register will contain the precise designation of each shareholder and
the indication of the number of ordinary shares held, the indication of the payments made on the ordinary shares as
well as the transfers of ordinary shares and the dates thereof. Ownership of ordinary shares will be established by
inscription in the said register or in the event separate registrars have been appointed pursuant to Article 6.5, in such
separate register(s). Without prejudice to the conditions for transfer by book entries provided for in Article 6.7 of
these Articles of Association, a transfer of ordinary shares shall be carried out by means of a declaration of transfer
entered in the relevant register, dated and signed by the transferor and the transferee or by their duly authorized
representatives or by the Company upon notification of the transfer or acceptance of the transfer by the Company.
The Company may accept and enter in the relevant register a transfer on the basis of correspondence or other
documents recording the agreement between the transferor and the transferee.
         6.5.    The Company may appoint registrars in different jurisdictions who may each maintain a separate
register for the ordinary shares entered therein. Shareholders may elect to be entered into one of these registers and
to transfer their ordinary shares to another register so maintained. The Board of Directors may however impose
transfer restrictions for ordinary shares that are registered, listed, quoted, dealt in or have been placed in certain
jurisdictions in compliance with the requirements applicable therein. A transfer to the register kept at the Company's
registered office may always be requested.
         6.6.    Subject to the provisions of these Article 6.7 and Article 6.9, the Company may consider the person in
whose name the ordinary shares are registered in the register of shareholders as the full owner of such shares. In
the event that a holder of ordinary shares does not provide an address in writing to which all notices or
announcements from the Company may be sent, the Company may permit a notice to this effect to be entered into
the register of shareholders and such holder’s address will be deemed to be at the registered office of the Company
or such other address as may be so entered by the Company from time to time, until a different address shall be
provided to




                                                PAGE 3
the Company by such holder in writing. The holder may, at any time, change his address as entered in the register of
shareholders by means of written notification to the Company.
        6.7.    The ordinary shares may be held by a holder (the “Holder”) through a securities settlement system or
a Depositary (as this term is defined below). The Holder of ordinary shares held in such fungible securities accounts
has the same rights and obligations as if such Holder held the ordinary shares directly. The ordinary shares held
through a securities settlement system or a Depositary shall be recorded in an account opened in the name of the
Holder and may be transferred from one account to another in accordance with customary procedures for the
transfer of securities in book-entry form. However, the Company will make dividend payments, if any, and any other
payments in cash, ordinary shares or other securities, if any, only to the securities settlement system or Depositary
recorded in the register of shareholders or in accordance with the instructions of such securities settlement system or
Depositary. Such payment will grant full discharge of the Company’s obligations in this respect.
        6.8.    In connection with a general meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may decide that no entry
shall be made in the register of shareholders and no notice of a transfer shall be recognized by the Company and the
registrar(s) during the period starting on the Record Date (as hereinafter defined) and ending on the closing of such
general meeting.
        6.9.    All communications and notices to be given to a registered shareholder shall be deemed validly made
if made to the latest address communicated by the shareholder to the Company in accordance with Article 6.5 or, if
no address has been communicated by the shareholder, the registered office of the Company or such other address
as may be so entered by the Company in the register from time to time according to Article 6.7.
        6.10. Where ordinary shares are recorded in the register of shareholders in the name of or on behalf of a
securities settlement system or the operator of such system and recorded as book-entry interests in the accounts of
a professional depositary or any sub-depositary (any depositary and any sub-depositary being referred to hereinafter
as a “Depositary”), the Company - subject to having received from the Depositary a certificate in proper form - will
permit the Depositary of such book-entry interests to exercise the rights attaching to the ordinary shares
corresponding to the book-entry interests of the relevant Holder, including receiving notices of general
meetings, admission to and voting at general meetings, and shall consider the Depositary to be the holder of the
ordinary shares corresponding to the book-entry interests for purposes of this Article 6 of the present Articles of
Association. The Board of Directors may determine the formal requirements with which such certificates must
comply.
        Article 7.- Increase and Reduction of Capital
        7.1.    The authorized capital and the subscribed capital of the Company may be increased or reduced in
one or several times by a resolution of the shareholders voting with the quorum and majority rules set by these
Articles of Association or, as the case may be, by the law for any amendment of these Articles of Association.
        7.2.    The subscribed capital of the Company may also be increased in one or several times by a resolution
of the Board of Directors within the limits of the authorized capital.
        7.3.    The new ordinary shares to be subscribed for by contribution in cash will be offered by preference to
the existing shareholders in proportion to the part of the capital which those shareholders are holding. The Board of
Directors shall determine the period within which the preferred subscription right shall be exercised. This period may
not be less than fourteen days from the date of dispatch of a registered mail or any other means of communication
individually accepted by the addressees and ensuring access to the information sent to the shareholders announcing
the opening of the subscription period.
        7.4.    Notwithstanding the above, the general meeting, voting with the quorum and majority rules required
for any amendment of the Articles of Association, may suppress, waive or limit the preferential subscription right or




                                               PAGE 4
authorize the Board of Directors to do so, to the extent that the Board of Directors deems such suppression, waiver
or limitation advisable for any issuance or issuances of shares within the scope of the authorized share capital.
         7.5.    If after the end of the subscription period not all of the preferential subscription rights offered to the
existing shareholder(s) have been subscribed by the latter, third parties may be allowed to participate in the share
capital increase, except if the Board of Directors decides that the preferential subscription rights shall be offered to
the existing shareholders who have already exercised their rights during the subscription period, in proportion to the
portion their ordinary shares represent in the share capital; the modalities for the subscription are determined by the
Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may also decide in such case that the share capital shall only be
increased by the amount of subscriptions received by the shareholder(s) of the Company.
         Article 8.- Acquisition of own shares
         The Company may acquire or repurchase its own ordinary shares. The acquisition and holding of its own
ordinary shares will be in compliance with the conditions and limits established by the law.
         Article 9.- Beneficiary Certificates
         9.1.    The Company may issue, from time to time, beneficiary certificates (“parts bénéficiaires”) having the
rights set forth in these Articles of Association (the “Beneficiary Certificates”). The Board of Directors is hereby
authorized to issue up to one billion four hundred million (1,400,000,000) Beneficiary Certificates without reserving to
the existing shareholders a pre-emptive right to subscribe for the Beneficiary Certificates issued. The Beneficiary
Certificates may only be issued to shareholders of the Company. The Board of Directors shall determine, in its
absolute discretion, to which shareholders such Beneficiary Certificates shall be issued. At the time of their issuance,
the Board of Directors shall link the Beneficiary Certificates to one or more ordinary shares of the Company held by
the shareholder(s) to whom they are being issued based on a specific ratio applicable to such shareholder as
determined by the Board of Directors at time of issuance, with such ratio to be between 1:1 and 20:1 of Beneficiary
Certificates to ordinary shares.
         9.2.    There are currently three hundred forty-three million eight hundred forty-one thousand six
hundred ninety (343,841,690) Beneficiary Certificates outstanding out of the four hundred nineteen million
seven hundred ninety-seven thousand nine hundred (419,797,900) Beneficiary Certificates issued.
        9.3.    In the event that the Board of Directors proceeds to an issue of Beneficiary Certificates in accordance
with the provisions of this Article 9, it shall take, or cause to be taken, all steps necessary to amend the Articles of
Association to reflect such issuance.
        9.4.    The Beneficiary Certificates shall be issued in registered form only and the ownership of each
Beneficiary Certificate shall be established by an entry in a register of Beneficiary Certificates (the “BC Register”).
The BC Register shall constitute evidence of ownership of the Beneficiary Certificates and the person whose name
appears in the BC Register as a holder shall be treated as the owner of the Beneficiary Certificates registered in his
name.
        9.5.    The BC Register may be maintained by the Company at its registered office or may be entrusted by
the Company to a transfer agent. The BC Register shall contain the identity of the holders, the number of Beneficiary
Certificates held by each of them as well as their address and the date of entry. In case of transfer, redemption or
cancellation in accordance with the provisions of these Articles of Association, appropriate entries shall be made.
        The Company shall recognize only one single owner per Beneficiary Certificate. If one or more Beneficiary
Certificates are jointly owned, or if fractions of a Beneficiary Certificate are held by several holders or if the
ownership of such Beneficiary Certificate(s) is disputed, all persons claiming a right to such Beneficiary Certificate(s),
or holding a fraction of a Beneficiary Certificate respectively, have to appoint one single attorney to represent such
Beneficiary Certificate(s) towards the Company. The failure to appoint such




                                                 PAGE 5
attorney implies a suspension of the voting right(s) attached to such Beneficiary Certificate(s).
         9.6.    The Beneficiary Certificates shall not carry any right to participate in any dividend, share premium
repayment or any other kind of distributions, including the distribution of any liquidation proceeds, made by the
Company.
         9.7.    Each Beneficiary Certificate shall carry one (1) vote at any general meeting of the Company and each
Beneficiary Certificate will be taken into consideration for the calculation of quorum and majority required for any
such general meeting of the Company.
         9.8.    The Beneficiary Certificates may not be transferred and shall automatically be cancelled in case of
sale or transfer of the share(s) to which they are linked, provided that exceptions to transfers of Beneficiary
Certificates or to their cancellation upon sale or transfer of the respective underlying ordinary shares to which they
are linked may be made by the Board of Directors on a case-by-case basis and in its absolute discretion, at which
time the Board may also recalculate the ratio and, if applicable, re-allocate any such non-cancelled Beneficiary
Certificates to the remaining applicable ordinary shares (which are already linked to other Beneficiary Certificates) on
a pro rata basis. In case of any permitted recalculation of ordinary shares as a result of a share split, bonus issue of
ordinary shares, subdivision or split of shares or a combination of shares through a reverse split or similar actions,
the Beneficiary Certificates shall be treated in the same manner as the ordinary shares to which they are linked.
         9.9.    In the same manner, all the Beneficiary Certificates shall automatically be cancelled in case the
number of ordinary shares held by Rosello Company Limited and D.G.E Investments Ltd, including their respective
successors, in the aggregate, falls under seven million five hundred sixty-four thousand six hundred (7,564,600)
ordinary shares.
         9.10. Any amendment to the rights of the holders of Beneficiary Certificates set out in the Articles of
Association shall require a decision of the general meeting of shareholders adopted with the quorum and majority
required for an amendment to the Articles of Association. In addition, the same quorum and majority shall also be
reached in a meeting of the holders of Beneficiary Certificates as if the same were voting as a separate class.
                   CHAPTER III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS, STATUTORY AUDITORS
         Article 10.- Board of Directors
         10.1. The Company will be managed and administered by a board of directors (the "Board of Directors")

(the "Directors"). The Board of Directors shall always be composed of at least three (3) Directors.
         10.2. The Directors will be elected by the shareholders’ meeting which will determine the duration of their
mandate, and they will hold office until their successors are elected. They may be re-elected for successive terms

         Article 11.- Vacancy in the office of the Board of Directors
         In the event of a vacancy in the office of a member of the Board of Directors because of death, legal
incapacity, bankruptcy, resignation or otherwise, this vacancy may be filled on a temporary basis and for a period of
time not exceeding the initial mandate of the replaced member of the Board of Directors by the remaining members
of the Board of Directors until the next general meetings of the shareholders of the Company which shall resolve on
the permanent appointment in compliance with the applicable legal provisions and present Articles of Association.
         Article 12.- Meetings of the Board of Directors

at such meeting.
   12.iv. Except in cases of urgency or with the prior consent of all those entitled to attend, at least twenty-four hours’
written notice of board meetings shall be given in writing, by fax, by mail, by e-mail or by any other mean of written
communication. Any such notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting as well as the agenda and the
nature of the business to be transacted. The notice may be waived by the consent in writing, by fax, by mail or by e-
mail of each Director. No separate notice is required for meetings held at times and places specified in a schedule

year, only independent directors of the Company may hold a meeting, the quorum required for a meeting of the
Board of Directors can be disregarded and the independent directors must all be present or represented at this
meeting.
  12.viii. All business arising at any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be determined by resolution passed by a
majority of votes cast. In the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have the right to cast the deciding vote
(the “Casting Vote”). The Casting Vote shall be personal to the Chairman and will not transfer to any other Director
acting as a chairman of a meeting of the Board of Directors in the Chairman’s absence.
   12.ix. One or more Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference call, by videoconference or by
any similar means of communication enabling thus several persons participating therein to simultaneously
communicate with each other. Such participation shall be deemed equivalent to a physical presence at the meeting.
   12.x. A written decision, signed by all the Directors, is proper and valid as though it had been adopted at a meeting
of the Board of Directors which was duly convened and held. Such a decision can be documented in a single

Directors.
          Article 13.- Minutes of Meetings of the Board of Directors

          Article 14.- Powers of the Board of Directors
          The Board of Directors is vested with the broadest powers (except for those powers which are expressly
reserved by law to the sole shareholder or the general meeting of shareholders) to perform all acts necessary or
useful for accomplishing the Company’s object. All powers not expressly reserved by law or by the Articles of
Association to the sole shareholder or the general meeting of shareholders are in the competence of the Board of
Directors.
          Article 15.- Delegation of Powers
          According to article 441-10 of the Law, the daily management of the Company as well as the representation
of the Company in relation with this management may be delegated to one or more Directors (the “Managing
Director(s)”), officers, managers or other agents, associate or not, acting alone or jointly. Their nomination,
revocation and powers shall be settled by a resolution of the Board of Directors. The delegation to a member of the
Board




                                                 PAGE 7
of Directors shall entail the obligation for the Board of Directors to report each year to the ordinary general meeting
on the salary, fees and any advantages granted to the delegate. The Company may also grant special powers by
authentic proxy or power of attorney by private instrument.

          Article 16.- Conflict of Interests
          16.1. Save as otherwise provided by the Law, any member of the Board of Directors who has, directly or
indirectly, a financial interest conflicting with the interest of the Company in connection with a transaction falling
within the competence of the Board of Directors, must inform the Board of Directors of such conflict of interest and
must have his declaration recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors. The relevant member of
the Board of Directors may not take part in the discussions relating to such transaction nor vote on such transaction.
Any such conflict of interest must be reported to the next general meeting of shareholders of the Company prior to
such meeting taking any resolution on any other item.
          16.2. Where, by reason of conflicting interests, the number of members of the Board of Directors required in
order to validly deliberate is not met, the Board of Directors may decide to submit the decision on this specific item to
the general meeting of shareholders.
          16.3. The conflict of interest rules shall not apply where the decision of the Board of Directors relates to
day-to-day transactions entered into under normal conditions.
          16.4. The daily manager(s) of the Company, if any, are subject to articles 16.1 to 16.3 of these Articles of
Association provided that if only one daily manager has been appointed and is in a situation of conflicting interests,
the relevant decision shall be adopted by the Board of Directors.
          Article 17.- Committees of the board of directors
          The Board of Directors may establish one or more committees, including without limitation, an audit
committee and a remuneration committee, and for which it shall, if one or more of such committees are set up,
appoint the members who may be but do not need to be members of the Board of Directors (subject always, if the
ordinary shares of the Company are listed on a foreign stock exchange, to the requirements of such foreign stock
exchange applicable to the Company and/or of such regulatory authority competent in relation to such listing),
determine the purpose, powers and authorities as well as the procedures and such other rules as may be applicable
thereto.
          Article 18.- Indemnification
          18.1. The members of the Board of Directors are not held personally liable for the indebtedness or other
obligations of the Company. As agents of the Company, they are responsible for the performance of their duties.
Subject to the exceptions and limitations listed in Article 18.2 and mandatory provisions of law, every person who is,
or has been, a member of the Board of Directors or officer of the Company shall be indemnified by the Company to
the fullest extent permitted by law against liability and against all expenses reasonably incurred or paid by him in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding which he becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of
his or her being or having been a director or officer and against amounts paid or incurred by him or her in the
settlement thereof. The words “claim”, “action”, “suit” or “proceeding” shall apply to all claims, actions, suits or
proceedings (civil, criminal or otherwise including appeals) actual or threatened and the words “liability” and
“expenses” shall include without limitation attorneys’ fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in settlement and other
liabilities.
          18.2. No indemnification shall be provided to any director, officer or shareholder (i) against any liability by
reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct
of his or her office (ii) with respect to any matter as to which he or she shall have been finally adjudicated to have
acted in bad faith and not in the interest of the Company or (iii) in the event of a settlement, unless the settlement
has been approved by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the Board of Directors.
          18.3. The right of indemnification herein provided shall be severable, shall not affect any other rights to
which any director or officer may now or hereafter be entitled, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be
such

receive such proxies, at the same time. The Board of Directors may set a shorter period for the submission of the
certificate or the proxy.

the auditor(s) made in compliance with Luxembourg law. The notice sent to the shareholders and to the holders of
Beneficiary Certificates in accordance with the law will specify the time and place of the meeting as well as the
agenda and the nature of the business to be transacted.
         24.2. If all the shareholders and holders of Beneficiary Certificates are present or represented at a General
Meeting and if they state that they have been informed of the agenda of the meeting, the General Meeting may be
held without prior notice.
         24.3. Shareholders and holders of Beneficiary Certificates may act at any General Meeting by appointing in
writing, by fax, mail, email or by any other mean of written communication, as his proxy another person who need not
be a shareholder nor a holder of Beneficiary Certificates.

a signed voting form sent by mail or facsimile or by any other means of communication authorized by the Board of
Directors and delivered to the Company’s registered office or to the address specified in the convening notice. The
shareholders and holders of Beneficiary Certificates may only use voting forms provided by the Company which
contain at least the place, date and time of the meeting, the agenda of the meeting, the proposals submitted to the
resolution of the General Meeting, as well as for each proposal three boxes allowing the shareholder and holder of
Beneficiary Certificates to vote in favor of or against the proposed resolution or to abstain from voting thereon by
ticking the appropriate boxes. The Company will only take into account voting forms received no later than three (3)
business days prior to the date of the General Meeting to which they relate. The Board of Directors may set a shorter
period for the submission of the voting forms.
         24.5. The Board of Directors may determine all other conditions that must be fulfilled in order to take part in
General Meeting.
         24.6. Except as otherwise required by law or by the present Articles of Association, resolutions will be taken
by a simple majority of votes irrespective of the number of shareholders and holders of Beneficiary Certificates
present or represented at the General Meeting.
         24.7. One vote is attached to each outstanding ordinary share. Each Beneficiary Certificate entitles its
holder to one vote.
         24.8. Copies of extracts of the minutes of the meeting to be produced in judicial proceedings or otherwise
will be signed by any two members of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Luxembourg law and accounting practice.
         Article 26.- Appropriation of Profits
    26.i. From the annual net profits of the Company, five per cent (5%) shall be allocated to the reserve required by
law. That allocation will cease to be required as soon and as long as such reserve amounts to ten per cent (10%) of
the subscribed capital of the Company.

decide to allocate the whole or part of the remainder to a reserve or to a provision reserve, to carry it forward to the

  26.iii. Subject to the conditions fixed by law, the Board of Directors may pay out an advance payment on dividends.

         Article 27.- Dissolution, Liquidation
         27.1. The Company may be dissolved by a decision of the General Meeting voting with the same quorum
and majority as for the amendment of these Articles of Association, unless otherwise provided by law.
         27.2. Should the Company be dissolved, the liquidation will be carried out by one or more liquidators
appointed by the General Meeting, which will determine their powers and their compensation.

the net assets shall be distributed equally to the holders of the ordinary shares pro rata to the number of the ordinary
shares held by them.

         Article 28.- Amendments of the Articles of Association
         These Articles of Association may be amended by a resolution of the General Meeting adopted under a
quorum of fifty per cent (50%) of the share capital of the Company and a majority of two thirds of the votes of the
shareholders and holders of Beneficiary Certificates of the Company, provided that the agenda of the General
Meeting indicates the proposed amendments and that a copy of the coordinated articles of association is made
available at the registered office of the Company at least eight (8) days prior to the general meeting of shareholders
and holders of Beneficiary Certificates.
         Article 29.- Change of nationality
         The shareholders may change the nationality of the Company by a resolution of the General Meeting adopted
in the manner required for an amendment of these Articles of Association.
                                    CHAPTER VIII. APPLICABLE LAW

shareholders' agreement shall prevail inter partes and to the extent permitted by Luxembourg law.”

nature à interférer avec l'activité normale de la Société à son siège social, il pourra transférer provisoirement le siège
social à l'étranger jusqu'à la cessation complète de ces circonstances exceptionnelles. Ces mesures provisoires
n'auront toutefois aucun effet sur la nationalité de la Société, laquelle, nonobstant ce transfert provisoire du siège
social, restera une société régie par les lois du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg.
        Article 3. Objet

        Article 5. Capital Social
        5.1. Le capital social souscrit émis est fixé à cent vingt-cinq mille huit cent trente-neuf virgule sept six huit

chacune.
        5.3 Le Conseil d’Administration est autorisé à sous-déléguer à un des Administrateurs de la Société, fondé de
pouvoir de la Société, ou toute autre personne dûment autorisée, pendant une période se terminant cinq (5) ans
après la date de publication du procès-verbal de l’assemblée générale extraordinaire des actionnaires tenue le 29
mars 2023, au RESA, Recueil Electronique des Sociétés et Association, de (i) réaliser toute augmentation du capital
social dans les limites du capital autorisé en une ou plusieurs tranches successives par l’émission de nouvelles
actions ordinaires avec ou sans prime d’émission, en contrepartie d’un paiement en espèces ou en nature, (a)
suivant l’exercice des droits de souscription et/ou (b) suivant l’exercice des droits de conversion accordés par le
Conseil d’Administration sous les conditions de bons de souscription (pouvant être attachés ou séparés




                                                PAGE 12
d’actions ordinaires, d’obligations ou autres instruments similaires), d’obligations convertibles ou d’autres
instruments similaires émis de temps en temps par la Société, (c) par la conversion de créances ou (d) de toute
autre manière, (ii) déterminer le lieu et la date d’émission, le prix d’émission, les conditions générales de souscription
et de libération des nouvelles actions ordinaires et (iii) supprimer ou limiter le droit préférentiel de souscription des
actionnaires.
         5.4 Les actions ordinaires peuvent être émises à une valeur supérieure, égale ou inférieure à leur valeur de
marché, mais en aucun cas à une valeur inférieure à leur valeur nominale ou à la valeur nette comptable d’une
action ordinaire.
         Article 6. Actions
         6.1 Les actions ordinaires sont et devront être uniquement sous forme nominative.
         6.2     Aucune fraction d’action ordinaire ne peut exister ou être émise. Le Conseil d'Administration est
cependant autorisé à organiser de façon discrétionnaire le paiement en espèces au lieu de toute fraction d'action
ordinaire de la Société.
         6.3 Les actions ordinaires peuvent être détenues en fiducie par un ou plusieurs actionnaires.
         6.4 Un registre des actionnaires sera tenu par la Société à son siège social où il sera mis à disposition aux
fins de vérifications par tout actionnaire. Ce registre contiendra la désignation précise de chaque actionnaire et
l’indication du nombre de ses actions ordinaires, l’indication des paiements effectués sur ses actions ordinaires ainsi
que les transferts des actions ordinaires avec leur date. La propriété des actions ordinaires sera établie par
l’inscription sur ledit registre ou dans le cas ou des teneurs de registres séparés ont été nommés conformément à
l’Article 6.5 des Statuts, dans ce(s) registre(s) séparé(s). Sans préjudice des conditions de transfert par inscriptions
prévues à l’Article 6.7 des Statuts, un transfert d’actions ordinaires devra être effectué au moyen d’une déclaration
de transfert inscrite dans le registre concerné, datée et signée par le cédant et le cessionnaire ou par leurs
représentants dûment autorisés ou par la Société suite à la notification de la cession ou de l’acceptation de la
cession par la Société. La Société peut accepter et inscrire un transfert dans le registre approprié sur la base d’une
correspondance ou de tout autre document actant un accord entre le cédant et le cessionnaire.
         6.5 La Société peut nommer des teneurs de registre dans différentes juridictions qui pourront tenir chacun
un registre séparé pour les actions ordinaires qui y seront inscrites. Les actionnaires pourront choisir d'être inscrits
dans l'un des registres et de transférer leurs actions ordinaires dans un autre registre tenu de cette façon. Le Conseil
d'Administration peut toutefois imposer des restrictions au transfert pour les actions ordinaires inscrites, cotées,
traitées ou placées dans certaines juridictions conformément aux exigences applicables dans ces juridictions. Un
transfert dans le registre tenu au siège social de la Société peut toujours être demandé.
         6.6 Sous réserve des dispositions de l'Article 6.7 et l'Article 6.9, la Société peut considérer la personne au
nom de laquelle les actions ordinaires sont inscrites dans le registre des actionnaires comme étant le propriétaire
unique desdites actions ordinaires. Dans le cas où un détenteur d'actions ordinaires n’ai pas fourni par voie écrite
d'adresse à laquelle toutes les notifications et communications de la Société pourront être envoyées, la Société
pourra permettre l’inscription de cette information dans le registre des actionnaires et l'adresse de ce détenteur sera
considérée comme étant au siège social de la Société ou à tout autre adresse que la Société pourra inscrire au fil du
temps jusqu'à ce que ce détenteur ait fourni par écrit une adresse différente à la Société. Le détenteur peut modifier
à tout moment son adresse figurant au registre des actionnaires au moyen d'une notification écrite faite à la Société.
         6.7 Les actions ordinaires peuvent être tenues par un porteur (le «Porteur») au travers d’un système de
compensation ou d'un Dépositaire (tel que ce terme est défini ci-dessous). Le Porteur d'actions ordinaires détenues
dans ces comptes de titres fongibles a les mêmes droits et obligations que si




                                                PAGE 13
ce Porteur détenait directement les actions ordinaires. Les actions ordinaires détenues au travers d’un système de
compensation ou d'un Dépositaire doivent être consignées dans un compte ouvert au nom du Porteur et peuvent
être transférées d'un compte à un autre, conformément aux procédures habituelles pour le transfert de titres sous
forme d'inscription en compte. Toutefois, la Société versera les dividendes, s’il y en a, ainsi que tout autre paiement
en espèces, actions ordinaires ou autres titres, s’il y en a, uniquement au profit du système de compensation ou du
Dépositaire inscrits dans le registre des actionnaires ou conformément aux instructions de ce système de
compensation ou du Dépositaire. Ce paiement déchargera complètement la Société de ses obligations à cet égard.
        6.8     Dans le cadre d'une assemblée générale des actionnaires, le Conseil d'Administration peut décider
qu’aucune inscription ne soit faite dans le registre des actionnaires et qu’aucun avis de transfert ne soit reconnu par
la Société et le(s) teneur(s) de registre durant la période commençant à la Date d’Inscription (telle que définie ci-
après) et se terminant à la clôture de cette assemblée générale.
        6.9    Toutes les communications et avis à donner à un actionnaire inscrit sont réputés valablement faits s’ils
sont faits à la dernière adresse communiquée par l'actionnaire à la Société conformément à l'Article 6.5 ou, si
aucune adresse n'a été communiquée par l'actionnaire, au siège social de la Société ou à toute autre adresse que la
Société pourra inscrire dans le registre au fil du temps conformément à l'Article 6.7.
        6.10     Lorsque les actions ordinaires sont enregistrées dans le registre des actionnaires au nom ou pour le
compte d’un système de compensation ou de l’opérateur d’un tel système et enregistrées comme des entrées dans
les comptes d’un dépositaire professionnel ou de tout sous-dépositaire (tout dépositaire et tout sous-dépositaire sera
désigné ci-après comme un «Dépositaire»), la Société – sous réserve d'avoir reçu du Dépositaire un certificat en
bonne et due forme – permettra au Dépositaire de telles entrées en compte d'exercer les droits attachés aux actions
ordinaires correspondant aux entrées en compte du Porteur concerné, y compris de recevoir les convocations aux
assemblées générales, l'admission et le vote aux assemblées générales et devra considérer le Dépositaire comme
étant le porteur des actions ordinaires correspondant aux entrées en compte aux fins du présent Article 6 des
présents Statuts. Le Conseil d'Administration peut déterminer les conditions de forme auxquelles devront répondre
ces certificats.
        Article 7. Augmentation et Réduction du Capital Social
        7.1 Le capital autorisé et le capital émis de la Société peut être augmenté ou réduit, en une ou en plusieurs
fois, par une résolution de l’assemblée générale des actionnaires, selon le cas, adoptée aux conditions de quorum et
de majorité exigées par les présents Statuts ou, le cas échéant, par la loi pour toute modification des Statuts.
        7.2    Le capital souscrit de la Société peut également être augmenté à une ou plusieurs reprises par une
résolution du Conseil d’Administration, dans les limites du capital autorisé.
        7.3 Les nouvelles actions ordinaires à souscrire par apport en numéraire seront offertes par préférence aux
actionnaires existants proportionnellement à la part du capital qu’ils détiennent. Le Conseil d'Administration fixera le
délai pendant lequel le droit préférentiel de souscription devra être exercé. Ce délai ne pourra pas être inférieur à
quatorze jours à compter de la date d'envoi d'une lettre recommandée ou de tout autre moyen de communication
accepté individuellement par les destinataires et garantissant l'accès aux informations transmises aux actionnaires
annonçant l'ouverture de la période de souscription.
        7.4 Par dérogation à ce que est dit ci-dessus, l'assemblée générale, délibérant aux mêmes conditions de
quorum et de majorité que celles exigées pour toute modification des Statuts, peut supprimer, renoncer ou limiter le
droit préférentiel de souscription ou autoriser le Conseil d’Administration à le faire, dans la mesure où le Conseil
d'Administration jugera cette suppression, renonciation ou limitation opportune pour toute émission ou émissions
d'actions dans la cadre du capital autorisé.




                                               PAGE 14
         7.5    Si après la fin de la période de souscription, tous les droits préférentiels de souscription offerts aux
actionnaires existants n'ont pas été exercés par ces derniers, des tiers peuvent être autorisés à participer à
l'augmentation du capital social, sauf si le Conseil d'Administration décide que les droits préférentiels de souscription
seront offerts aux actionnaires existants qui ont déjà exercé leurs droits pendant la période de souscription,
proportionnellement à la part de leurs actions ordinaires dans le capital social; les modalités de souscription sont
déterminées par le Conseil d'Administration. Le Conseil d'Administration peut également décider dans ce cas que le
capital social ne sera augmenté qu’à concurrence du montant des souscriptions reçues par le(s) actionnaire(s) de la
Société
         Article 8. Rachat d’actions
         La Société peut acquérir ou racheter ses propres actions ordinaires.
         L’acquisition et la détention de ses propres actions ordinaires se fera conformément aux conditions et dans
les limites fixées par la loi.
         Article 9. Parts Bénéficiaires
         9.1 La Société peut émettre à tout moment des parts bénéficiaires disposant de droits fixés par les Statuts
(les “Parts Bénéficiaires”). Le Conseil d'Administration est autorisé à émettre jusqu’à un milliard quatre cent millions
(1.400.000.000) de Parts Bénéficiaires sans qu’un droit préférentiel de souscription soit réservé aux actionnaires
existants pour les Parts Bénéficiaires émises. Les Parts Bénéficiaires ne pourront être émises qu’aux actionnaires
de la Société. La décision d’émettre des Parts Bénéficiaires à un actionnaire relève de l’entière discrétion du Conseil
d'Administration. Au moment de leur émission, le Conseil d'Administration devra lier les Parts Bénéficiaires à une ou
plusieurs actions ordinaires de la Société détenues par l' (les) actionnaire(s) en faveur duquel (desquels) elles ont
été émises, sur base d’un ratio applicable à cet actionnaire tel que fixé par le Conseil d'Administration au moment de
l'émission, ce ratio devant se situer entre 1:1 et 20:1 des Parts Bénéficiaires aux actions ordinaires.
         9.2 Il y a actuellement trois cent quarante-trois millions huit cent quarante et un mille six cent quatre-vingt-
dix (343.841.690) Parts Bénéficiaires en circulation sur les quatre cent dix-neuf millions sept cent quatre-vingt-dix-
sept mille neuf cents (419.797.900) Parts Bénéficiaires émises.
         9.3     Dans l'hypothèse où le Conseil d'Administration procède à une émission des Parts Bénéficiaires
conformément aux dispositions du présent Article 9, il prend, ou fait prendre, tous les étapes nécessaires à la
modification des Statuts afin qu’ils reflètent cette émission.
         9.4    Les Parts Bénéficiaires seront émises uniquement sous forme nominative et la propriété de chaque
Part Bénéficiaire s'établit par inscription au registre des Parts Bénéficiaires (le “Registre PB”). Le Registre PB
constitue la preuve de la propriété des Parts Bénéficiaires et toute personne dont le nom figure au Registre PB
comme titulaire est considérée propriétaire des Parts Bénéficiaires enregistrées à son nom.
         9.5 Le Registre PB pourra être tenu par la Société à son siège social ou pourra être confié par la Société à
un agent de transfert. Le Registre PB doit contenir l'identité des détenteurs de Parts Bénéficiaires, le nombre des
Parts Bénéficiaires détenues par chacun d'eux ainsi que leur adresse et date d'entrée. En cas de transfert, rachat ou
annulation effectués conformément aux dispositions des Statuts, les écritures correspondantes devront être inscrites
au registre.
         La Société ne reconnaît qu'un seul propriétaire par Part Bénéficiaire. Si la propriété de la Part Bénéficiaire est
indivise, ou si des fractions d’une Part Bénéficiaire sont détenues par plusieurs détenteurs de Parts Bénéficiaires ou
si la propriété de ces Parts Bénéficiaires est contestée, l’ensemble des personnes invoquant un droit sur cette (ces)
Part(s) Bénéficiaire(s), ou disposant d'une fraction d’une Part Bénéficiaire respectivement, doivent nommer un
mandataire spécial pour représenter cette (ces) Part(s) Bénéficiaire(s) envers la Société. Le manquement à cette
obligation de nomination pourra entraîner la suspension du (des) droit(s) de vote rattaché(s) à de telle(s) Part(s)
Bénéficiaire(s).
         9.6 Les Parts Bénéficiaires ne donnent pas le droit aux dividendes, remboursement de primes d'émission
ou à des distributions de quelque type




                                                PAGE 15
que ce soit, y compris la distribution du boni de liquidation réalisée par la Société.
         9.7 Chaque Part Bénéficiaire donne droit à une (1) voix à toute assemblée générale des actionnaires de la
Société et chaque Part Bénéficiaire sera prise en considération dans le calcul du quorum et de la majorité requis
pour les assemblées générales de la Société.
         9.8 Les Parts Bénéficiaires ne peuvent pas être transférées et devront être automatiquement annulées en
cas de cession ou de transfert de(s) l’action(s) à laquelle (auxquelles) elles sont liées, étant donné que les
exceptions aux transferts des Parts Bénéficiaires ou à leur annulation lors de la cession ou du transfert des actions
ordinaires sous-jacentes auxquelles elles sont liées seront décidées par le Conseil d'Administration au cas par cas et
relèveront de son entière discrétion, à cette occasion, le Conseil d’Administration pourra aussi recalculer le ratio et,
le cas échéant, répartir les Parts Bénéficiaires non annulées aux actions ordinaires éligibles restantes (déjà liées à
d’autres Parts Bénéficiaires) au prorata. En cas d'un calcul autorisé d’actions ordinaires résultant d’un
fractionnement d’actions, d’attribution d'actions ordinaires gratuites, d’une subdivision ou division des actions ou
combinaison d’actions à travers une consolidation ou action similaire, les Parts Bénéficiaires sont traitées de la
même manière que les actions ordinaires auxquelles elles sont liées.
         9.9 De la même façon, toutes les Parts Bénéficiaires seront automatiquement annulées dans l'hypothèse
où le nombre d'actions ordinaires total détenu par Rosello Company Limited et D.G.E Investments Ltd, et leurs
successeurs, descendrait en dessous de sept millions cinq cent soixante-quatre mille six cents (7.564.600) actions
ordinaires.
         9.10    Toute modification affectant les droits des détenteurs de Parts Bénéficiaires fixés dans les Statuts
requiert une décision de l'assemblée générale des actionnaires prise aux conditions de quorum et de majorité
requises pour une modification des Statuts. En outre, les mêmes quorum et majorité devront également être atteints
à une assemblée des titulaires des Parts Bénéficiaires comme s’ils votaient en tant que catégorie distincte.
                 CHAPITRE III.- ADMINISTRATEURS, COMMISSAIRE AUX COMPTES
         Article 10. Conseil d’Administration
         10.1 La Société est gérée et administrée par un conseil d'administration (le "Conseil d'Administration")
composé de membres de catégorie A (les "Administrateurs A") et de membres de catégorie B (les
"Administrateurs B"), associés ou non (les "Administrateurs"). Le Conseil d’Administration doit toujours être
composé au minimum de trois (3) Administrateurs.
         10.2 Les Administrateurs seront nommés par l’assemblée générale qui détermine la durée de leur mandat,
et ils resteront en fonction jusqu’à ce que leurs successeurs soient élus. Ils peuvent être réélus pour des mandats
successifs et ils peuvent être révoqués à tout moment, avec ou sans motif par décision de l’assemblée générale.

        Article 11. Vacance d’un poste de membre du Conseil d’Administration
        En cas de vacance d'un membre du Conseil d'administration en raison d'un décès, d'une incapacité légale,
d'une faillite, d'une démission ou autre, ce poste peut être pourvu de manière temporaire et pour une durée
n'excédant pas le mandat initial du membre remplacé du Conseil d'Administration, par les autres membres du
Conseil d'Administration jusqu'à la prochaine assemblée générale des actionnaires de la Société qui se prononcera
sur la nomination permanente dans le respect des dispositions légales applicables et des présents Statuts.
        Article 12. Réunions du Conseil d’Administration
        12.1 Le Conseil d’Administration peut choisir parmi ses membres un président (le « Président »). Il pourra
également nommer un secrétaire qui n’a pas besoin d’être membre du Conseil d’Administration et qui sera
responsable de la tenue des procès-verbaux des réunions du Conseil d’Administration et des actionnaires.




                                               PAGE 16
         12.2      Le Conseil d’Administration se réunira sur convocation du Président. Une réunion du Conseil
d’Administration doit être convoquée si deux Administrateurs le demandent.
         12.3 Le Président présidera toutes les réunions du Conseil d’Administration et les assemblées générales
des actionnaires (si nécessaires), mais en son absence le Conseil d’Administration pourra désigner un autre
membre du Conseil d’Administration et l’assemblée générale des actionnaires pourra désigner toute autre personne
comme président pro tempore à la majorité des membres présents ou représentés.
         12.4 Sauf en cas d’urgence ou avec l’accord écrit préalable de tous ceux qui ont le droit d’y assister, une
convocation écrite de toute réunion du Conseil d’Administration devra être transmise, vingt-quatre heures au moins
avant la date prévue pour la réunion, par télécopie, par courrier, par courriel ou tout autre moyen de communication.
La convocation indiquera la date, l’heure et le lieu de la réunion ainsi que l’ordre du jour et la nature des affaires à
traiter. Il pourra être passé outre cette convocation avec l’accord écrit transmis par télécopie, par courrier ou par
courriel de chaque membre du conseil d’Administration. Une convocation spéciale ne sera pas requise pour les
réunions se tenant à une date et à un endroit déterminés dans une résolution préalablement adoptée par le Conseil
d’Administration.
         12.5     Toute réunion du Conseil d’ Administration se tiendra à Luxembourg ou tout autre endroit que le
Conseil d’Administration pourra déterminer d’un temps à l’autre.
         12.6     Tout membre du Conseil d’Administration pourra se faire représenter aux réunions du Conseil d’
Administration en désignant par écrit, par télécopie, par couriel ou par courrier un autre membre du Conseil d’
Administration comme son mandataire.
         12.7     Le quorum du Conseil d’Administration est d’un (1) Administrateur A et d’un (1) Administrateur B
présent à la réunion ou, dans l’hypothèse où aucun administrateur de catégorie A ou de catégorie B n’ait été nommé,
trois (3) Administrateurs en fonction. Dans le cas où, la Section 303A.03 du manuel des sociétés cotées de la bourse
de New-York (New-York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual), exige qu’une réunion des administrateurs
indépendants prenne place au moins une fois par an, le quorum requis pour une réunion du Conseil d’Administration
pourra être ignoré et tous les administrateurs indépendants devront alors être présents ou représentés à cette
réunion.
         12.8 Toutes les affaires à l’ordre du jour de toute réunion du Conseil d’Administration seront déterminées
par une résolution passée à la majorité des voix en faveur de la résolution. Dans le cas d’une égalité de voix, le
Président aura une voix prépondérante (la « Voix Prépondérante»). La Voix Prépondérante sera personnelle au
Président et ne pourra être transférée à un Administrateur agissant comme président de la réunion du Conseil
d’Administration, en l’absence du Président.
         12.9      Un ou plusieurs Administrateurs peuvent participer à une réunion par conférence téléphonique,
visioconférence ou par tout autre moyen de communication similaire permettant ainsi à plusieurs personnes y
participant de communiquer simultanément l’une avec l’autre. Une telle participation sera considérée équivalente à
une présence physique à la réunion.
         12.10 Une décision écrite signée par tous les Administrateurs est régulière et valable comme si elle avait
été adoptée à une réunion du Conseil d’Administration, dûment convoquée et tenue. Une telle décision pourra être
consignée dans un seul ou plusieurs écrits séparés ayant le même contenu et signé par un ou plusieurs
Administrateurs.
         Article 13. Procès-verbaux des Réunions du Conseil d’Administration
         13.1 Les procès-verbaux de toute réunion du Conseil d'Administration seront signés par le Président de la
réunion et par le secrétaire (s’il y a un). Les procurations resteront annexées aux procès-verbaux.




                                               PAGE 17
        13.2 Les copies ou extraits de ces procès-verbaux, destinés à servir en justice ou ailleurs, seront signés
par le Président et le secrétaire (s’il y en a) ou par deux membres du Conseil d’Administration.
        Article 14. Pouvoirs du Conseil d’Administration
        Le Conseil d’Administration est investi de tous les pouvoirs (à l’exception de ceux qui sont expressément
réservés par la loi à l’associé unique ou à l’assemblée générale des actionnaires) pour accomplir tout acte
nécessaire pour accomplir l’objet social de la Société. Tous pouvoirs qui ne sont pas expressément réservés par la
loi ou par les Statuts à l’associé unique ou à l’assemblée générale des actionnaires sont dans la compétence du
Conseil d’Administration.
        Article 15. Délégation de Pouvoirs
        La gestion journalière de la Société ainsi que la représentation de la Société en ce qui concerne cette gestion
pourront, conformément à l'article 441-10 de la Loi, être déléguées à un ou plusieurs Administrateurs (le(s)
« Administrateur(s) Délégué(s) », directeurs, gérants et autres agents, associés ou non, agissant seuls ou
conjointement. Leur nomination, leur révocation et leurs attributions seront réglées par une décision du Conseil
d'Administration. La délégation à un membre du Conseil d'Administration impose au conseil d’Administration
l’obligation de rendre annuellement compte à l’assemblée générale ordinaire, des traitements, émoluments et
avantages quelconques alloués au délégué. La Société peut également conférer tous mandats spéciaux par
procuration authentique ou sous seing privé.
        Article 16. Conflit d'Intérêts
        16.1 Sauf dispositions contraires de la Loi, tout membre du Conseil d’Administration qui a, directement ou
indirectement, un intérêt de nature patrimoniale opposé à celui de la Société à l’occasion d’une opération relevant du
Conseil d’Administration est tenu d’en prévenir le Conseil d’Administration et de faire mentionner cette déclaration
dans le procès-verbal de la séance. L’administrateur concerné ne peut prendre part ni aux discussions relatives à
cette opération, ni au vote y afférent. Ce conflit d’intérêts doit également faire l’objet d’un rapport aux actionnaires,
lors de la prochaine assemblée générale des actionnaires, et avant toute prise de décision de l’assemblée générale
des actionnaires sur tout autre point à l’ordre du jour.
        16.2      Lorsque, en raison d’un conflit d’intérêts, le nombre d’administrateurs requis afin de délibérer
valablement n’est pas atteint, le Conseil d’Administration peut décider de déférer la décision sur ce point spécifique à
l’assemblée générale des actionnaires.
        16.3      Les règles relatives aux conflits d'intérêts ne s'appliquent pas lorsque la décision du Conseil
d'Administration se rapporte à des opérations courantes conclues dans des conditions normales.
        16.4 Le(s) délégués à la gestion journalière de la Société le cas échéant, sont soumis aux articles 16.1 à
16.3 des présents Statuts à condition qu’un seul délégué à la gestion journalière de la Société ait été désigné et se
trouve en situation conflit d'intérêts, la décision visée devant être adoptée par le Conseil d'Administration.
        Article 17. Comité du Conseil d’Administration
        Le Conseil d’Administration peut créer un ou plusieurs comités, incluant sans limitation, un comité d’audit et
un comité de rémunération, et pour lesquels il doit, si un ou plusieurs de ces comités sont mis en place, nommer les
membres qui peuvent, mais ne doivent pas nécessairement, être des membres du Conseil d'Administration (si les
actions ordinaires de la Société sont cotées à une bourse étrangère toujours sous réserve des exigences de cette
bourse étrangère applicables à la Société et/ou de l’autorité de régulation compétente en relation avec cette
cotation), déterminer le but, les pouvoirs et compétences ainsi que les procédures et les autres règles pour autant
que de besoin.
        Article 18. Indemnisation
        18.1      Les membres du Conseil d'Administration ne sont pas tenus personnellement responsables des
dettes ou des autres obligations de la Société. En tant que mandataires de la Société, ils sont responsables de
l’exercice de leurs fonctions. Sous réserve des exceptions et limites prévues à l'Article 18.2 ainsi que des
dispositions impératives de la loi, toute personne




                                                PAGE 18
qui est, ou a été, membre du Conseil d'Administration ou dirigeant de la Société devra être indemnisé par la Société,
dans toute la mesure permise par la loi, pour toute responsabilité et toute dépense raisonnablement engagées ou
payées par lui en rapport avec toute réclamation, action, poursuite ou procédure dans lesquelles il est impliqué en
tant que partie ou pour être ou avoir été un administrateur ou un dirigeant, et pour les sommes payées ou engagées
par lui dans le règlement de celles-ci. Les mots «demande», «action », «poursuite» ou «procédure» s'appliqueront à
toutes les demandes, actions, poursuites ou procédures (civiles, pénales ou autres, y compris les appels) actuelles
ou menacées et les mots « responsabilité » et «dépenses» comprennent, sans limitation les frais d'avocat, les coûts,
les jugements, les montants payés en transaction et autres passifs.
         18.2      Aucune indemnisation ne sera due à tout administrateur, dirigeant ou actionnaire (i) contre toute
responsabilité en raison de fautes intentionnelles, de mauvaise foi, de négligence grave ou d’une imprudence
flagrante des tâches concernées dans l’exercice de sa fonction (ii) à l'égard de toute affaire dans laquelle il/elle aura
été finalement condamné pour avoir agi de mauvaise foi et non contre l'intérêt de la Société ou (iii) dans le cas d'une
transaction, à moins que la transaction ait été approuvée par un tribunal d’une juridiction compétente, ou par le
Conseil d'Administration.
         18.3 Le droit à indemnisation prévu ici est divisible, ne doit pas porter atteinte à tout autre droit auquel tout
administrateur ou dirigeant peut présentement ou postérieurement avoir droit et doit continuer pour une personne qui
a cessé d'être un tel administrateur ou dirigeant et bénéficiera aux héritiers, exécuteurs testamentaires et
administrateurs d’une telle personne. Aucune de ces dispositions ne peut affecter ou limiter les droits à
indemnisation dont le personnel de l’entreprise, y compris les administrateurs et dirigeants, peuvent avoir droit par
contrat ou autrement en vertu de la loi. La Société est expressément habilitée à fournir une indemnisation
contractuelle et peut souscrire et maintenir une assurance pour tout membre du personnel de l’entreprise, y compris
les administrateurs et dirigeants de la Société, à tout moment.
         Article 19. Représentation de la Société
         Vis-à-vis des tiers, la Société sera engagée par la signature conjointe d’un Administrateur A et d’un
Administrateur B, ou par la signature individuelle de la personne à laquelle la gestion journalière de la Société a été
déléguée dans les limites d’une telle délégation, ou par la signature conjointe ou par la signature individuelle de
toutes personnes à qui un tel pouvoir de signature aura été délégué par le Conseil d’Administration, mais seulement
dans les limites de ce pouvoir.
         Article 20. Commissaires aux Comptes
         20.1 Les transactions de la Société devront être contrôlées par un ou plusieurs commissaires aux comptes.
L'assemblée générale des actionnaires devra nommer le(s) commissaire(s) aux comptes et devra déterminer leur
mandat, lequel ne peut excéder six (6) ans.
         20.2 Un commissaire aux comptes peut être révoqué à tout moment, sans préavis et avec ou sans motif,
par l'assemblée générale des actionnaires.
         20.3.      Le(s) commissaire(s) aux comptes dispose(nt) d'un droit de regard et de contrôle permanent et
illimité sur toutes les opérations de la Société.
         20.4. Si l'assemblée générale des actionnaires de la Société nomme un ou plusieurs réviseurs d'entreprises
agréés conformément à l'article 69 de la loi du 19 décembre 2002 relative au registre du commerce et des sociétés
et à la comptabilité et aux comptes annuels des entreprises, telle que modifiée, la nomination des commissaires aux
comptes n'est plus requise.
         20.5. Un auditeur indépendant ne peut être révoqué que par l'assemblée générale des actionnaires pour un
motif valable ou avec son approbation.
                     CHAPITRE IV.- ASSEMBLÉE GÉNÉRALE DES ACTIONNAIRES
         Article 21. Pouvoirs de l'Assemblée Générale des Actionnaires
         L’assemblée générale des actionnaires de la Société et les détenteurs de Parts Bénéficiaires représentent
l'ensemble des actionnaires et l’ensemble des détenteurs de Parts Bénéficiaires de la Société (l’ « Assemblée




                                                PAGE 19
Générale »). L’Assemblée Générale a tous les pouvoirs qui lui sont réservés par la loi.
        Article 22. Assemblée Générale Annuelle
        L'Assemblée Générale annuelle devra se tenir dans les six (6) mois suivant la fin de chaque exercice social
au Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, au siège social de la Société ou à tout autre endroit au Grand-Duché de
Luxembourg tel qu’indiqué dans la convocation de cette assemblée. D'autres Assemblées Générales peuvent être

inscrits dans un registre des actionnaires de la Société, le Porteur ou le Dépositaire, selon le cas, et les détenteurs

pourra déterminer une date et une heure antérieures à l'Assemblée Générale comme date de référence pour
l'admission à l'assemblée générale des actionnaires (la «Date d'Inscription »), qui ne pourra être inférieure à cinq
(5) jours avant la date de cette assemblée.
        23.5      Tout actionnaire de la Société, Porteur ou Dépositaire, selon le cas, et tout détenteur de Parts
Bénéficiaires peut assister à l’Assemblée Générale en nommant une autre personne comme son mandataire, une
telle nomination doit être faite par écrit d’une manière devant être déterminée par le Conseil d'Administration dans la
convocation. Dans le cas d'actions ordinaires détenues par l'opérateur d'un système de compensation ou par un
Dépositaire désigné par un tel Dépositaire, un porteur d'actions ordinaires qui souhaite assister à une Assemblée
Générale doit recevoir de ces mêmes opérateurs ou Dépositaires un certificat attestant le nombre d’actions
ordinaires inscrites dans le compte correspondant à la Date d'Inscription et attestant que ces actions ordinaires sont
bloquées jusqu'à la clôture de l'Assemblée Générale en question. Le certificat devra être présenté à la Société au

Bénéficiaires vote au moyen d'une procuration, la procuration doit être déposée au siège social de la Société ou
chez tout autre agent de la Société, dûment autorisé à recevoir ces procurations, dans le même temps. Le Conseil
d'Administration peut fixer un délai plus court pour le dépôt du certificat ou de la procuration.

l'Assemblée Générale.

atteindra dix pour cent (10%) du capital émis.
         26.2 L'Assemblée Générale décide de l'affectation du solde des bénéfices annuels nets. Elle peut décider
de verser la totalité ou une partie du solde à un compte de réserve ou de provision, de le reporter à nouveau ou de
le distribuer aux actionnaires comme dividendes.
         26.3     Dans les conditions établies par la loi, le Conseil d’Administration peut payer une avance sur les

                                                               SPOTIFY TECHNOLOGY S.A.
                                                                  CLAWBACK POLICY
         The People Experience and Compensation Committee of the Board of Spotify Technology S.A. (the “Company”) has adopted this Clawback Policy
(the “Policy”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined when they are first used are defined in Section 11.
    1.   Persons Subject to Policy
         This Policy shall apply to current and former Officers.
    2.   Compensation Subject to Policy
         This Policy shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after October 2, 2023. For purposes of this Policy, the date on which
Incentive-Based Compensation is “received” shall be determined under the Applicable Rules, which generally provide that Incentive-Based Compensation is
“received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is attained or satisfied, without regard to whether the grant,
vesting, or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.
    3.   Recovery of Compensation
         In the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall recover, reasonably promptly and in accordance with Section 4
below, the portion of any Incentive-Based Compensation that is Erroneously Awarded Compensation, unless the Committee has determined that recovery from
the relevant current or former Officer would be Impracticable, except where any member of the Committee is not independent, a majority of the independent
directors serving on the Board shall make such determination. Recovery shall be required in accordance with the preceding sentence regardless of whether the
applicable Officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for the Restatement and regardless of whether or when restated
financial statements are filed by the Company. For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy will not give rise to any
Officer’s right to voluntarily terminate employment for “good reason,” or due to a “constructive termination” (or any similar term of like effect) under any
plan, program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates.
    4.   Manner of Recovery; Limitation on Duplicative Recovery
         The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the manner of recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include, without
limitation, reduction or cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of Incentive-Based Compensation, Erroneously Awarded Compensation or
time-vesting equity awards, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this Policy of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and, to the extent
permitted by law, an offset of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation against other compensation payable by the Company or an affiliate of the Company to
such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise prohibited by the Applicable Rules, to the extent this Policy provides for recovery of Erroneously
Awarded Compensation already recovered by the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or Other Recovery Arrangements, the
amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation already recovered by the Company from the recipient of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation may be
credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation required to be recovered pursuant to this Policy from such person.
    5.   Administration
         This Policy shall be administered, interpreted and construed by the Committee, which is authorized to make all determinations necessary, appropriate
or advisable for such purpose. The Board may re-vest in itself the authority to administer, interpret and construe this Policy in accordance with applicable law,
and in such event references herein to the “Committee” shall be deemed to be references to the Board. Subject to any permitted review by the applicable
national securities exchange or association pursuant to the Applicable Rules, all determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the
provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company and its affiliates, shareholders and employees. The
Committee may delegate administrative duties with respect to this Policy to one or more directors or employees of the Company, as permitted under applicable
law, including any Applicable Rules.
    6.   Interpretation
                                                                                                                                                        Exhibit 97.1




This Policy shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the extent this Policy is
inconsistent with such Applicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure compliance therewith.
    7.   No Indemnification or Advancement of Expenses; No Liability
The Company shall not indemnify or provide advancement of expenses or insure any person against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation
pursuant to this Policy, nor shall the Company directly or indirectly pay or reimburse any person for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such
person may elect to purchase to fund such person’s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company or any member of
the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy.
    8.   Application; Enforceability
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee or the Board, the adoption of this Policy does not limit, and is intended to apply in addition to, any Other
Recovery Arrangements. Subject to Section 4, the remedy specified in this Policy shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to every other right or remedy
at law or in equity that may be available to the Company or an affiliate of the Company or is otherwise required by applicable law and regulations.
    9.   Severability
The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law; provided, however, to the extent that any provision of this Policy is
found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be
deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.
    10. Amendment and Termination
The Board or the Committee may amend, modify or terminate this Policy in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion. This
Policy will terminate automatically when the Company does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or association.
    11. Definitions
  “Applicable Rules” means Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 promulgated thereunder, the listing rules of the national securities exchange or
association on which the Company’s securities are listed, and any applicable rules, standards or other guidance adopted by the Securities and Exchange

         “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.
         “Committee” means the People Experience and Compensation Committee of the Board.
        “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by a current or former Officer that exceeds the
