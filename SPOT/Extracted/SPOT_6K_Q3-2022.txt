Financial Summary
Revenue                                     Revenue of €3,036 million grew 21% Y/Y in Q3 (or 12% Y/Y constant currency), reflecting:

                                                ●        Premium Revenue growth of 22% Y/Y (or 13% Y/Y constant currency), led by subscriber gains; and
                                                ●        Ad-Supported Revenue growth of 19% Y/Y (or 3% Y/Y constant currency), led by podcasting

Profitability                              Gross Margin was 24.7% in Q3, down 201 bps Y/Y reflecting:

                                                ●       Continued growth in Marketplace activity and favorable revenue mix shift to podcasting; offset by

                                           Operating Loss of (€228) million reflected the above and Operating Expense growth of 65% Y/Y (or 51% Y/Y
                                           constant currency), reflecting:

                                                ●       Higher personnel costs primarily due to headcount growth (global ad sales team expansion, platform
                                                        investment and acquisitions) and higher advertising costs for growth initiatives (Emerging Markets,

                                                ●       Currency movements had a negative 1,433 bps impact on expense growth, or €85 million, given the
                                                        unfavorable geographic mix of employee costs relative to revenue.

Free Cash Flow                             Free Cash Flow1 was €35 million in Q3. Capital expenditures decreased €20 million Y/Y to €5 million in the

Revenue
Resilient Premium growth, led by subscribers
Premium Revenue grew 22% Y/Y to €2,651 million, reflecting subscriber
growth of 13% Y/Y and Premium ARPU¹ growth of 7% Y/Y to €4.63 (or
down 1% constant currency). Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU
performance was impacted by market mix.



Ad-Supported growth driven by podcasting
Ad-Supported revenue grew 19% Y/Y and reached 13% of Total
Revenue, reflecting double-digit growth across all regions with the
exception of Europe where we saw the impact of challenging regional
economic conditions. Our music business grew high single digits Y/Y
and was led by high single digit growth in impressions sold. Podcast
revenue grew in the strong double-digit range Y/Y across both our
Original and Exclusive podcasts and the Spotify Audience Network.
Podcast growth was led by the Spotify Audience Network, where sold
impressions grew strong double-digits and CPMs increased
double-digits. We also saw a substantial increase in the number of
participating shows and advertisers in the Spotify Audience Network.

Operating Expenses
Growth largely driven by headcount expansion and unfavorable FX impact

Operating Expenses grew 65% Y/Y (or 51% constant
currency), largely reflecting various growth initiatives that were
greenlit toward the end of 2021 and the impact of recent
acquisitions such as Podsights, Findaway, Sonantic, Chartable,
Whooshkaa and Heardle. Additionally, Y/Y comparisons were
affected by the prior year benefit from Social Charge
movements, which did not recur in Q3’22.

2022 continues to be an investment year for Spotify, as we
build out the resources and infrastructure necessary to drive
our multi-modal, multi-vertical strategy forward. We continue to
re-evaluate our spending with an eye towards increasing return
efficiency and enhancing productivity across the organization.
We remain focused on gaining favorable Operating Expense
leverage as we progress towards the intermediate-to-long-term
targets we conveyed at our 2022 Investor Day.

Free Cash Flow
The 10th quarter in a row of positive FCF

Free Cash Flow was €35 million in Q3, a decrease Y/Y
as lower Net Income adjusted for non-cash items was
partially offset by favorability in net working capital.
Capital expenditures decreased €20 million Y/Y to €5
million as a result of the completion of office build-outs.

This was the 10th quarter in a row of positive Free
Cash Flow. While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can
fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on seasonality
and timing, we have averaged over €200 million of
positive Free Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis
for the past three years.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Research and development
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium
revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing expense excluding foreign exchange
effect, Research and development expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors because they present measures that
facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Operating expense, Sales
and marketing expense, Research and development expense, and General and administrative expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful
to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently
occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared
in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important

potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the “Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances; our
dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply
with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes; the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required
under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions and ownership thereof embodied in sound recordings in order to obtain licenses or comply with existing license agreements; assertions by
third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware,
networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain user data security; undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities in our products; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising
from our systems or systems of third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us; risks relating to privacy and data security; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; our ability to achieve our net zero

the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and interest rates, the continued conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to
manage and remediate attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; tax-related risks; the concentration
of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed
discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from our estimates and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 3, 2022, as updated by subsequently filed reports for our interim results on Form 6-K. We undertake no obligation
to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder update.
