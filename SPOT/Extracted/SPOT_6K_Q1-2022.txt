Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)

1.       Corporate information

            Spotify Technology S.A. (the "Company" or "parent") is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company's
registered office is 42-44 avenue de la Gare, L-1610, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

            The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group," "we," "us," or "our") is audio streaming. The Group's
premium service ("Premium Service") provides users with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts. The
Premium Service offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks. The Group's ad-supported service ("Ad-Supported Service" and together with
the Premium Service, the "Service") has no subscription fees and provides users with limited on-demand online access to the catalog of music and unlimited
online access to the catalog of podcasts. The Group depends on securing content licenses from a number of major and minor content owners and other rights
holders in order to provide its service.

2.       Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies

              The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Spotify Technology S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 have
been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The interim financial information is unaudited. The interim financial information
reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2021, as they do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for a full year. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Euros.

New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group

            There are no new IFRS or IFRS Interpretation Committee ("IFRIC") interpretations effective for the three months ended March 31, 2022 that have
a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

New standards and interpretations issued not yet effective

            In January 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of
Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current, effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2023. The amendment would require the Group to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability if the exchange conditions are met, even if
no noteholder actually requires us to exchange their notes.

           There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact on the Group's interim
condensed consolidated financial statements.

3.       Critical accounting estimates and judgments

           In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Group's
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

            Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events.

4.       Business combinations

            During February 2022, the Group acquired 100% of In Defense of Growth Inc. ("Podsights") and Chartable Holding, Inc. ("Chartable") to provide
improved podcast ad measurement and analytics services. These acquisitions allow the Group to expand and scale its podcast monetization and product
offering for advertisers and publishers.



                                                                               -6-
Table of Contents




             The combined fair value of the purchase consideration for the two acquisitions was €83 million in cash, paid at closing. The acquisitions were
accounted for under the acquisition method. Of the total purchase consideration, €59 million has been recorded to goodwill, €26 million to acquired intangible
assets, €4 million to cash and cash equivalents, €1 million to other tangible net assets, and €7 million to deferred tax liabilities. The Group incurred €2 million
in acquisition related costs which were recognized as general and administrative expenses.

            The goodwill represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate
recognition, including expected future synergies and technical expertise of the acquired workforce. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was included in the Ad-Supported segment.

            The intangible assets acquired relate to existing technology and customer relationships. The useful lives of existing technology ranges from three to
five years and the useful life of customer relationships is one year. The Group valued the existing technology using the multi-period excess earnings and
replacement cost methods, under the income approach and cost approach, respectively. The Group valued the customer relationships using the replacement cost
method, under the cost approach.

            In addition to the purchase consideration, there are cash payments of €21 million that are contingent on the continued employment of certain
employees. In addition, €10 million of equity instruments were offered to and accepted by certain employees, which have vesting conditions contingent on
continued employment and are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation transactions. These cash payments and share-based compensation
transactions are recognized as post-combination expense over employment service periods of up to four years, if not forfeited by the employees.

           For the three months ended March 31, 2022, revenues and operating results of the acquired businesses were not significant to the Group's
condensed consolidated statement of operations.

           The amount for business combinations, net of cash acquired, within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 includes €6 million of investing cash outflows for deferred consideration of previous business combinations.

5.       Segment information

            The Group has two reportable segments: Premium and Ad-Supported. Revenue for the Premium segment is generated primarily through
subscription fees. Revenue for the Ad-Supported segment is primarily generated through the sale of advertising across the Group's music and podcast content.
Royalty costs are primarily recorded in each segment based on specific rates for each segment agreed to with rights holders. All podcast content costs are
recorded in the Ad-Supported segment. The remaining costs that are not specifically associated to either of the segments are allocated based on user activity or
the revenue recognized in each segment. The operations of businesses acquired during March 31, 2021 and 2022 are included in the Ad-Supported segment. No
operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.



                                                                                -7-

Reconciliation of segment gross profit

           Operating expenses, finance income, and finance costs are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an overall Group basis.
The reconciliation between reportable segment gross profit to the Group's income before tax is as follows:

7.       Income tax

             The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were 15.3% and 73.8%, respectively. The Group operates in a global
environment with significant operations in various jurisdictions outside Luxembourg. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate
reflecting the Group's earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions where the Group operates.

            For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax expense of €24 million was due primarily to the impact of share-based compensation
deductions recognized in equity. The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due primarily to reassessment of uncertain tax positions and
current period share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity.

           Transactions recorded through other comprehensive (loss)/income have been shown net of their tax impact, as applicable.

            We are subject to ongoing tax audits in several jurisdictions, and most of these audits involve transfer pricing issues. Tax authorities in certain
jurisdictions have challenged our tax positions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits, taking into account any new information available, in
order to determine the appropriateness of our tax reserves. If we conclude that it is not probable that our tax position will be accepted, the effect of that
uncertainty is reflected at either the most likely amount or the expected value, taking into account a range of possible outcomes.

             Tax provisions in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position were €6 million as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, of
which €5 million is reasonably expected to be resolved within twelve months. The estimate of uncertain tax positions have a gross impact of €35 million
(before utilization of loss carry forwards) at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Interest and penalties included in income tax expense were not
material in any of the periods presented. Due to the uncertainty associated with our tax positions, any future agreement with the tax authorities could have a
significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

            Net deferred tax assets of €8 million and €13 million have been recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In evaluating the probability of realizing the deferred tax assets, the Group considered all available
positive and negative evidence of future tax profit, primarily past operating results. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, deferred tax assets of €584
million and €630 million have not been recognized.

8.         Earnings/(loss) per share

             Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares during the period. Diluted earnings/(loss)
per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares and potential outstanding ordinary shares during the period. Potential
ordinary shares, which are based on the weighted-average ordinary shares underlying outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, other contingently
issuable shares, warrants, and Exchangeable Notes and computed using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when
calculating diluted earnings/(loss) per share when their effect is dilutive. The computation of earnings/(loss) per share for the respective periods is as follows:

           In connection with the acquisition of Podsights during the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company granted 30,824 equity instruments to
certain employees of Podsights. The instruments vest annually over a four-year period from the acquisition date and the vesting is contingent on continued
employment. The instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions and are measured based on the fair market value of the
underlying ordinary shares on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for each equity instrument granted to employees of Podsights was US$162.21.

            In the table above, the number of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares released include ordinary shares that the Group has withheld for
settlement of employees' tax obligations due upon the vesting of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares.

17.   Exchangeable Notes

           On March 2, 2021, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Spotify USA Inc. (the “Issuer”), issued US$1,500 million aggregate principal amount
of 0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”), which included the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an
additional US$200 million principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased,
redeemed or exchanged. The Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis by the Company.

           The net proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting transaction costs of €18 million. The transaction
costs were immediately expensed and included in finance costs in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31,
2021.

             The Exchangeable Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with the Issuer's future senior, unsecured
indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Exchangeable Notes and effectively
subordinated to the Issuer’s future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Exchangeable Notes will be
structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Issuer is not a holder thereof) preferred
equity, if any, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

            The noteholders may exchange their Exchangeable Notes at their option into consideration that consists, at the Issuer’s election, of cash, ordinary
shares of the Company, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, but only under certain circumstances as set forth in the indenture governing the
Exchangeable Notes (the "Indenture"). The circumstances required to allow the noteholders to exchange their Exchangeable Notes were not met during the
three months ended March 31, 2022.

           The Exchangeable Notes will not be redeemable prior to March 20, 2024, except in the event of certain tax law changes as set forth in the Indenture.
The Exchangeable Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Issuer’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2024 and on or
before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable
Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of
the exchange price on:

         (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day
         immediately before the date the Issuer sends the related redemption notice; and

         (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends such notice.

           In addition, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Exchangeable Notes if certain changes in tax law as set forth in
the Indenture occur. In addition, calling any Exchangeable Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that
Exchangeable Note, in which case the exchange rate applicable to the exchange of that Exchangeable Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is
exchanged after it is called for redemption.

             Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” as set forth in the Indenture, noteholders may require the Issuer to repurchase their Exchangeable
Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date as set forth in the Indenture.



                                                                                - 16 -

           The Group accounted for the Exchangeable Notes at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS 9,
Financial Instruments. The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes as of March 31, 2022 was €1,146 million. See Note 21 for information regarding the key
inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes.

             Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. The results of such legal proceedings
are difficult to predict and the extent of the Group's financial exposure is difficult to estimate. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is
both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

              As of April 2019, the Group's settlement of the Ferrick et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 1:16-cv-8412-AJN (S.D.N.Y.), putative class action lawsuit,
which alleged that the Group unlawfully reproduced and distributed musical compositions without obtaining licenses, was final and effective. Even with the
effectiveness of the settlement, we may still be subject to claims of copyright infringement by rights holders who have purported to opt out of the settlement or
who may not otherwise be covered by its terms. The Music Modernization Act of 2018 contains a limitation of liability with respect to such lawsuits filed on or
after January 1, 2018. Rights holders may, nevertheless, file lawsuits, and may argue that they should not be bound by this limitation of liability. For example,
in August 2019, the Eight Mile Style, LLC et al v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 3:19-cv-00736-AAT, lawsuit was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Tennessee, alleging both that the Group does not qualify for the limitation of liability in the Music Modernization Act and that the limitation
of liability is unconstitutional and, thus, not valid law. The Group intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit, including plaintiffs' challenges to the limitation of
liability in the Music Modernization Act.

21.      Financial instruments

Foreign exchange forward contracts

Cash flow hedges

            The Group's currency pairs used for cash flow hedges are Euro / U.S. dollar, Euro / Australian dollar, Euro / British pound, Euro / Swedish krona,
Euro / Canadian dollar, and Euro / Norwegian krone. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts hedging the revenue and cost of revenue line items
in the condensed consolidated statement of operations was approximately €1,222 million and €870 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2022, and
approximately €1,185 million and €835 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.

Fair values

           The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, restricted cash, trade and
other payables, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. All other financial assets and liabilities
are accounted for at fair value.

Recurring fair value measurements

Long term investment - Tencent Music Entertainment Group

            The Group's approximate 8% investment in TME is carried at fair value through other comprehensive (loss)/income. The fair value of ordinary
shares of TME is based on the ending New York Stock Exchange American depository share price. The fair value of the investment in TME may vary over
time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macro-economic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate and systemic risks
of the equity markets overall.

            The table below presents the changes in the investment in TME:

           A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from
€560 million to €684 million at March 31, 2022.

            The following sections describe the valuation methodologies the Group uses to measure its Level 3 financial instruments at fair value on a recurring
basis.

Long term investments - Other
           The Group has interests in certain long term investments, the most significant of which is our equity investment in Kid Distro Holdings, LLC
("DistroKid"), an independent digital music distribution service. These long term investments primarily represent unlisted equity securities carried at fair value
through other comprehensive (loss)/income. The fair values of these equity investments are generally determined using business enterprise values based on
market transactions or by (i) applying market multiples to the projected financial performance and (ii) discounting the future value to its present value
equivalent. The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these equity investments include market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies used to estimate business enterprise value and discount rate.

            The fair value of the long term investments may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macroeconomic,
regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate, and systemic risks of the overall equity markets.

Warrants

            As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the number of outstanding warrants was 1,600,000.

            The outstanding warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the warrants in the
option pricing model are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                 March 31, 2022

Contingent consideration
            On April 1, 2019, the Group acquired Cutler Media, LLC ("Parcast"), a premier storytelling podcast studio. Included in the purchase price was €13
million related to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration is valued by the Group using a simulation of user
engagement outcomes. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized within general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations.

               The table below presents the changes in the contingent consideration liability:
                                                                                                                         2022                           2021

               As of March 31, 2022, the remaining maximum potential contingent consideration payout is €18 million which is to be paid in the second quarter of
fiscal 2022.
Exchangeable Notes
           The table below presents the changes in the Exchangeable Notes:
                                                                                                                         2022                           2021

           The change in estimated fair value is recognized within finance income/(costs) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, excluding
changes in fair value due to changes in the Group’s own credit risk, which are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income and will not be reclassified to
the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
          The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was estimated using a combination of a binomial option pricing model and prices observed for the
Exchangeable Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period. A weight of 75% was applied to the binomial option pricing
model and a weight of 25% was applied to the price of the Exchangeable Notes in the over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period.
The key assumptions used in the binomial option pricing model for the Exchangeable Notes were as follows:
                                                                                                                                                    March 31, 2022

           A decrease or increase of 10 percentage points in volatility would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,130
million to €1,166 million at March 31, 2022. A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the
Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,139 million to €1,154 million at March 31, 2022.

            In addition, the Group is subject to various non-cancelable purchase obligations and service agreements with minimum spend commitments,
including a service agreement with Google for the use of Google Cloud Platform and certain podcast and marketing commitments:

                                                                                                                       March 31, 2022        December 31, 2021

Contingencies
             Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. These may include, but are not
limited to, matters arising from alleged infringement of intellectual property; alleged violations of consumer regulations; employment-related matters; and
disputes arising from supplier and other contractual relationships. As a general matter, the music and other content made available on the Group's Service are
licensed to the Group by various third parties. Many of these licenses allow rights holders to audit the Group's royalty payments, and any such audit could
result in disputes over whether the Group has paid the proper royalties. If such a dispute were to occur, the Group could be required to pay additional royalties,
and the amounts involved could be material. The Group expenses legal fees as incurred. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material,
could have an adverse effect on the Group's operations or its financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

             On August 11, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion which, as of the issuance of the formal “mandate” on
October 26, 2020, vacated the Copyright Royalty Board’s determination of the royalty rates for applicable mechanical rights in the United States for calendar
years 2018 to 2022. These rates apply both to compositions that we license under compulsory license pursuant to Section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976 and
to a number of direct licenses that we have with music publishers. Until the final rates are determined, our recorded royalty costs both retrospectively and
prospectively will be based on management estimates of the rates that will apply. When the rates are determined anew, these could either benefit or adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.


23.   Events after the reporting period

        Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, the Group signed license agreements with certain publishers which include minimum guarantee and
spend commitments of approximately €116 million over the next two years.



                                                                              - 23 -

         •          tax-related risks;
         •          the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders' ability to influence our governance and business; and
         •          risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company.

             We operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to
predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor are we able to assess the impact of all of these risk factors on our business or the extent to which any risk factor, or
combination of risk factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

            We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed
under Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021 ("Annual Report on Form 20-F"), Part II,
Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below, and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

           You should read this discussion and analysis completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from
our expectations.

            Investors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our Investors website

Overview

           Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans
the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.

           We are the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service. With a presence in 183 countries and territories, our platform includes 422
million monthly active users ("MAUs"), including 182 million Premium Subscribers (as defined below) as of March 31, 2022.

           We currently monetize our Service through both subscriptions and advertising. Our Premium Subscribers have grown 15% year-over-year, as of
March 31, 2022, to 182 million. Our 422 million MAUs have grown 19% year-over-year, as of March 31, 2022.

           Our results reflect the effects of our trial programs, both discounted and free trials, in addition to seasonal trends in user behavior and, with respect
to our Ad-Supported segment, advertising behavior. Historically, Premium Subscriber growth accelerates when we run such trial programs.

            For our Ad-Supported segment, typically we experience higher advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater
advertising demand during the holiday season. However, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we typically experience a seasonal decline in advertising
revenue due to reduced advertiser demand.

Acquisitions

           During February 2022, the Group acquired Podsights and Chartable to provide improved podcast ad measurement and analytics services for a total
purchase consideration of €83 million. These acquisitions allow the Group to expand and scale its podcast monetization and product offering for advertisers
and publishers.

Global Marketing Partnerships

         On March 15, 2022, we announced a long-term partnership with FC Barcelona whereby Spotify will become the Main Partner of the Club and its
Official Audio Streaming Partner. This partnership will allow Spotify to amplify artist voices, connect artists to new and existing fans, and help grow our global
user base across key growth markets and audience segments.




                                                                                 - 25 -

Long term investment - Tencent Music Entertainment Group

         During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the fair value of our holdings in TME decreased by €230 million from €852 million as of December
31, 2021 to €622 million as of March 31, 2022 due to the decline in TME's share price during this period. The market value of our investment in TME
fluctuates due to volatility in the share price used to measure the investment. Furthermore, the value of our investment is subject to the risks associated with
TME’s business, as well as any changes by the Chinese government in foreign investment laws or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investments in
Chinese companies.

Impact of Russia-Ukraine Conflict

          In February 2022, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, economic sanctions were imposed on Russian individuals and entities, including financial
institutions, by countries around the world, including the U.S. and the European Union.

         During March 2022, we began winding down our operations and suspending our service in Russia. By April 11, 2022, we have fully suspended our
service in Russia. Suspension of our service did not have a material impact to our business, operating results, or financial condition.

        For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, due to the suspension of our service in Russia, we saw an involuntary churn of approximately 2 million Premium
Subscribers. We expect an additional involuntary churn of approximately 1 million Premium Subscribers for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. MAUs and Ad-
Supported MAUs as of March 31, 2022 each included approximately 5 million users from Russia.

         For additional information, see "Key Performance Indicators" section below. Also, refer to Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below.


Key Performance Indicators

           We use certain key performance indicators to monitor and manage our business. We use these indicators to evaluate our business, measure our
performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe these indicators provide useful
information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner we do.

MAUs
            We track MAUs as an indicator of the size of the audience engaged with our Service. We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users
and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated. Reported MAUs
may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Service within a thirty-day period as one individual may register for, and use, multiple
accounts. Additionally, though we strive to detect and minimize non-bona fide accounts that may typically be created in an attempt to artificially stream
content, they may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement in our reported MAUs. Our MAUs in the tables below are inclusive of Ad-Supported
Users who may have employed methods to limit or otherwise avoid being served advertisements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed
under Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, and in our other filings with the SEC.

           The table below sets forth our MAUs as of March 31, 2022 and 2021.

                                                                                         As of March 31
                                                                                  2022                    2021                                 Change
                                                                                                          (in millions, except percentages)
MAUs                                                                                      422                     356                         66            19 %

            MAUs were 422 million as of March 31, 2022 and 356 million as of March 31, 2021, which represented an increase of 19%. MAUs benefited from
our continued investment in driving the growth of our Service, both through geographic expansion and consumer marketing. MAUs also benefited from
continued investment in content and features on our platform, including featured playlists, artist marketing campaigns, podcasts, and original content, to drive
increased user engagement and customer satisfaction.




                                                                              - 26 -

            MAUs as of March 31, 2022 in the table above included approximately 5 million users from Russian operations, which have been suspended as of
April 11, 2022.

            During March 2022, there was a brief service outage that caused users to be involuntarily logged out of the Spotify application. As a result, we
believe certain affected users created new accounts to log back into the application, resulting in approximately 3 million additional MAUs as of March 31,
2022. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, following the one month anniversary of the outage, we saw a reversal of the approximate 3 million MAUs.

Premium Subscribers
            We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for Premium Service.
Our Premium Subscribers include all registered accounts in our Family Plan and Duo Plan. Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five
additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan Subscription. Our Duo Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to one
additional sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan Subscription. Premium Subscribers includes subscribers in a grace period of up
to 30 days after failing to pay their subscription fee.

           The table below sets forth our Premium Subscribers as of March 31, 2022 and 2021.
                                                                                         As of March 31

            Premium Subscribers were 182 million as of March 31, 2022 and 158 million as of March 31, 2021, which represented an increase of 15%. The
increase was due primarily to our Family Plan, while free trial offers and global campaigns related to our standard plan also accounted for a significant portion
of gross added Premium Subscribers.

             Premium Subscribers as of March 31, 2022 in the table above included approximately 1 million users from Russian operations, which have been
suspended as of April 11, 2022. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, due to the suspension of our service in Russia, we saw an involuntary churn of
approximately 2 million Premium Subscribers. We expect an additional involuntary churn of approximately 1 million Premium Subscribers for the second
quarter of fiscal 2022.

Ad-Supported MAUs
             We define Ad-Supported MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last
thirty days from the period-end indicated.

           The table below sets forth our Ad-Supported MAUs as of March 31, 2022 and 2021.
                                                                                         As of March 31

Ad-Supported MAUs                                                                         252                     208                         44            21 %

           Ad-Supported MAUs were 252 million as of March 31, 2022 and 208 million as of March 31, 2021, which represented an increase of 21%. Ad-
Supported MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Ad-Supported Service, both through geographic expansion and
consumer marketing. Ad-Supported MAUs also benefited from continued investment in content and features on our platform, including featured playlists, artist
marketing campaigns, podcasts, and original content, to drive increased Ad-Supported User engagement and customer satisfaction.

           Ad-Supported MAUs as of March 31, 2022 in the table above included approximately 5 million users from Russian operations, which have been
suspended as of April 11, 2022.

            During March 2022, there was a brief service outage that caused users to be involuntarily logged out of the Spotify application. As a result, we

Premium ARPU
            Premium average revenue per user ("ARPU") is a monthly measure defined as Premium subscription revenue recognized in the quarter indicated
divided by the average daily Premium Subscribers in such quarter, which is then divided by three months.

           The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
                                                                                 Three months ended March 31,

Premium ARPU                                                              €              4.38   €               4.12   €            0.26                     6%

            For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, Premium ARPU was €4.38 and €4.12, respectively, which represented an increase of 6%.
This increase of €0.26 is primarily attributable to movements in foreign exchange rates, increasing Premium ARPU by €0.15. Additionally, there was an
increase in ARPU for the Family Plan, as a result of price increases, as well as an increase in ARPU as a result of changes in Premium Subscriber mix.

How We Generate Revenue

           We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments - Premium and Ad-Supported. We identify our reportable segments based on the
organizational units used by the chief operating decision maker to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 5 to our interim condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments.

Premium
            We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of the Premium Service. The Premium Service is sold directly to end users and
through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone
subscriptions from their end customers. Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. We also
bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.

Ad-Supported
            We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising
impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on our platform on
behalf of their clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-
thousand basis and are evidenced by an insertion order that specifies the terms of the arrangement such as the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion
dates, and number of impressions or downloads in a stated period. Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated
exchanges, internal self-serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis. These
advertising arrangements typically specify the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions in a stated period.

Components of our Operating Results
             Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming. We incur royalty costs,
which we pay to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders, for the right to stream music to our users. Royalties are typically calculated
monthly based on the combination of a number of different elements. Generally, Premium Service royalties are based on the greater of a percentage of revenue
and a per user amount. Royalties for the Ad-Supported Service are typically a percentage of relevant revenue, although certain agreements are based on the
greater of a percentage of relevant revenue and an amount for each time a sound recording and musical composition are streamed. We have negotiated lower
per user amounts for our lower priced subscription plans such as Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan users. In our agreements with certain record labels,
the percentage of revenue used in the calculation of royalties is generally dependent upon certain targets being met. The targets can include such measures as
the number of Premium Subscribers, the ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, and/or the rates of Premium Subscriber churn. In addition,
royalty rates vary by country. Some of our royalty agreements require that royalty costs be paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. For
the majority of royalty agreements, incremental costs incurred due to un-recouped advances and minimum guarantees have not been significant to date. We also
have certain so-called most favored nation royalty agreements, which require us to record additional costs if certain material contract terms are not as favorable
as the terms we



                                                                              - 28 -

have agreed to with similar licensors. Cost of revenue also reflects discounts provided by certain rights holders in return for promotional activities in
connection with marketplace programs. Additionally, it includes the costs of discounted trials.

            Cost of revenue also includes the amortization of podcast content assets (both produced and licensed). Amortization of podcast content assets is
recorded over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period (if relevant) and begins at the release of each episode. We make payments
to podcast publishers, whose content we monetize through advertising sales, which are also included in cost of revenue.

            Cost of revenue also includes credit card and payment processing fees for subscription revenue, customer service, certain employee compensation
and benefits, cloud computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs.

             Research and Development. We invest heavily in research and development in order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction on our
platform, which we believe helps drive organic growth in MAUs, which, in turn, drives additional growth in, and better retention of, Premium Subscribers, as
well as increased advertising opportunities to our users. We aim to design products and features that create and enhance user experiences, and new technologies
are at the core of many of these opportunities. Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for the development of products related to our platform and Service,
as well as new advertising products and improvements to our mobile application and desktop application and streaming services. The costs incurred include
related facility costs, consulting costs, and employee compensation and benefits costs. We expect engineers to represent a significant portion of our employees
over the foreseeable future.

           Many of our new products and improvements to our platform require large investments and involve substantial time and risks to develop and
launch. Some of these products may not be well received or may take a long time for users to adopt. As a result, the benefits of our research and development
investments are difficult to forecast.

            Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, public relations, branding, consulting
expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, marketing events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with
music record labels, publishers, songwriters, and artists to promote the availability of new releases on our platform, and the costs of providing free trials of our
Premium Service. Expenses included in the cost of providing free trials are derived primarily from per user royalty fees determined in accordance with the
rights holder agreements.

            General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits for functions such as
finance, accounting, analytics, legal, human resources, consulting fees, and other costs including facility and equipment costs, directors' and officers' liability
insurance, director fees, and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration.

Results of Operations

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic
           The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
taken a number of actions focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, maintaining business continuity, and supporting the global music
community, including providing the ability to work-from-home for our employees.

             The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving
factors that we may not be able to accurately predict and that will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any resurgences,
the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, and actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response. We will continue to actively
monitor and respond accordingly to the changing conditions created by the pandemic. Refer to Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form
20-F for further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Premium revenue
             For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, Premium revenue comprised 89% and 90% of our total revenue, respectively. For the three
months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, Premium revenue increased €448 million, or 23%. The increase was
attributable primarily to a 15% increase in the number of Premium Subscribers and an increase in Premium ARPU, as noted above.

Ad-Supported revenue
            For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 11% and 10% of our total revenue, respectively. For the
three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, Ad-Supported revenue increased €66 million, or 31%. This
increase was due to growth in music impressions sold, growth in CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions), and improvements in sell-through rate, which increased
revenue in our direct and programmatic channels by €29 million. Ad sales from our self-serve platform and podcast ad sales also contributed to the increase in
revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Foreign exchange impact on total revenue
           The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as
compared to the same period in 2021, had a favorable net impact on our revenue. We estimate that total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022
would have been approximately €109 million lower, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable period in
2021.

Premium cost of revenue
             For the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, Premium cost of revenue increased €311
million, or 22%, and Premium cost of revenue as a percentage of Premium revenue remained flat at 72%. The increase in Premium cost of revenue was driven
primarily by growth in new Premium Subscribers and publishing licensing rate increases, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs,
collectively resulting in higher royalty costs of €285 million.

Ad-Supported cost of revenue
             For the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, Ad-Supported cost of revenue increased €80
million, or 39%, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue increased from 95% to 101%. The increase in Ad-Supported cost
of revenue was driven primarily by higher royalty costs and SPAN revenue sharing arrangement costs of €44 million due to growth in both advertising revenue
and streams as well as publishing licensing rate increases. There was also an increase in other content costs of €26 million.

Premium gross profit and gross margin
            For the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, Premium gross profit increased by €137
million, and Premium gross margin remained flat at 28%. Premium gross margin remained flat due to benefits from certain marketplace programs offset by
increases in publishing licensing rates during the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Ad-Supported gross profit/(loss) and gross margin
            For the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, Ad-Supported gross profit decreased by €14
million, and gross margin decreased from 4% to (1)%. The decrease in Ad-Supported gross margin was due primarily to an increase in royalty costs due to
growth in both advertising revenue and streams as well as publishing licensing rate increases during the three months ended March 31, 2022. An increase in
other content costs also contributed to the decrease in Ad-Supported gross margin.

benefits of €48 million as a result of increased headcount to support our growth, partially offset by a decrease in social costs of €20 million driven by share
price movements. In addition, there was an increase in information technology costs of €11 million due to increase in our usage of cloud computing services
and additional software license fees.

           For the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, finance costs decreased €17 million. The
decrease was due primarily to €18 million of transaction costs recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2021 in connection with the issuance of the
Exchangeable Notes.

            For the three months ended March 31, 2022, income tax expense was €24 million, compared to an income tax expense of €64 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2021. The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 is due primarily to current period share-based compensation
deductions recognized in equity. The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due primarily to reassessment of uncertain tax positions and
current period share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity.

Non-IFRS Financial Measure
           We have reported our financial results in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB. In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-IFRS
measure of Free Cash Flow as discussed below.

            We define "Free Cash Flow" as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in restricted cash. We believe Free
Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Free Cash
Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities.

            Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance. Because Free Cash
Flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. You should not consider Free Cash Flow in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported on our
interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document.

           Set forth below is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.
                                                                                                                                      Three months ended March 31,

Liquidity and Capital Resources

             Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operating activities. Cash and
cash equivalents and short term investments consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in government
securities, corporate debt securities, and collateralized reverse purchase agreements. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by €37
million from €3,500 million as of December 31, 2021 to €3,537 million as of March 31, 2022.

             We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and the cash flow we generate from our operations will be sufficient to
meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital
requirements may be materially different than those currently planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our
rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on content and research and development, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the
timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, our continued international expansion, the acquisition of other companies, competitive
factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global economic conditions. To the extent that current and



                                                                              - 33 -

anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or
debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders, while the incurrence of debt financing would result in debt
service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce covenants that might restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain
additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has
led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our
liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our strong cash and cash equivalents and short
term investments position are critical at this time of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and allow us to use our cash resources for working capital
needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Share Repurchase Program

            On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s
ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares were authorized at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders on
April 21, 2021. The repurchase program will expire on April 21, 2026. Since the commencement of this repurchase program and through March 31, 2022,
469,274 shares were repurchased for €94 million under this program.

             The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and
alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program is executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to
grow the business over the long term. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares, and the
repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company uses current cash and cash equivalents and the
cash flow it generates from operations to fund the share repurchase program.

Exchangeable Notes

         On March 2, 2021, Spotify USA Inc. issued US$1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. Net proceeds from the
issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting the transaction costs. See Note 17 to our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for further information regarding our Exchangeable Notes.

Operating activities
           Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by €28 million to €37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was due primarily to unfavorable changes in working capital of €25 million, principally due to unfavorable
movements in trade and other liabilities and deferred revenue, partially offset by favorable movements in trade receivables and other assets.

Investing activities
             Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net cash outflows from purchases and sales and maturities of short term investments of
€30 million as well as an increase in cash consideration used in business combinations, net of cash acquired, of €26 million. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of €14 million.

Financing activities
          Net cash flows from financing activities decreased by €1,228 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was due primarily to net proceeds of €1,223 million from the issuance of Exchangeable Notes during the three months
ended March 31, 2021 whereas no such activity occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2022.


Free Cash Flow
            Free Cash Flow decreased by €19 million to €22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2021, due primarily to a decrease in net cash flows from operating activities of €28 million, as described above, partially offset by a decrease in
capital expenditures of €14 million.

Restrictions on Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds
             The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Company by the Company's direct subsidiaries and by its
indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are subject to various restrictions. Future indebtedness of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of
dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Company. In addition, the ability of any of the Company's direct or indirect subsidiaries to
make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial
assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, liquidity requirements, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution, and other
legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. Spotify AB, which, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries,
conducts much of the Group's business, may only make dividends to the Company if there would continue to be full coverage of its restricted equity following
such dividend, and only if doing so would be considered prudent under Swedish law given the needs of Spotify AB and its subsidiaries. Loans and other
advances from Spotify AB to the Company may be subject to essentially the same restrictions as dividends. Since the Company is expected to rely primarily on
dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries to fund its financial and other obligations, restrictions on its ability to receive such funds may adversely
impact the Company's ability to fund its financial and other obligations.

Indebtedness
             As of March 31, 2022, our outstanding indebtedness, other than lease liabilities, consisted primarily of the Exchangeable Notes that mature on
March 15, 2026 and bear no interest. See Note 17 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our
Exchangeable Notes. We may from time to time seek to incur additional indebtedness. Such indebtedness, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions,
our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

            As of March 31, 2022, we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special
purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us
to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity,
market risk, or credit risk support to us.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

            Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks. Our primary market risk exposures relate to currency, interest rate, share price, and investment
risks. To manage these risks and our exposure to the unpredictability of financial markets, we seek to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial
performance and capital.

            Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and
share prices, both our own and those of third parties we use to value certain of our long-term investments. Refer to Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our
Annual Report on Form 20-F for further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Currency Risk

             Currency risk manifests itself in transaction exposure, which relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by
operations (purchasing and selling) and/or financing (interest and amortization). The volatility in foreign exchange rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in
particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro, may negatively affect our revenue. Our general policy is to hedge transaction exposure on a
case-by-case basis. Translation exposure relates to net investments in foreign operations. We do not conduct translation risk hedging.

Transaction Exposure Sensitivity

             In most cases, our customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental fees are
settled in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily settled in Euros and U.S. dollars. Hence, the operational need to net purchase foreign currency is
due primarily to a deficit from such settlements.




                                                                                              - 36 -

            The table below shows the immediate impact on Income before tax of a 10% strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro in the closing
exchange rate of significant currencies to which we have transaction exposure, at March 31, 2022. The sensitivity associated with a 10% weakening of a
particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.
                                                                                                                             USD                        SEK

Increase/(decrease) in income before tax                                                                                              132                       (14)

Translation Exposure Sensitivity

           The impact on our equity would be approximately €111 million if the Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on
the exposure at March 31, 2022.

Interest Rate Risk

            Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on earnings and cash flow. Our exposure to interest rate risk is
related to our interest-bearing assets, primarily our short term debt securities. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield of the investment. The sensitivity
analysis considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and we determined that it was reasonably possible that a change of 100 basis points could
be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have impacted interest income by €2 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022.

Share Price Risk

           Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the
Company's ordinary share price. Our exposure to this risk relates primarily to the Exchangeable Notes, outstanding warrants, and accrual for social costs on
outstanding share-based compensation awards.

           A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from
€1,139 million to €1,154 million at March 31, 2022.

           A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the warrants ranging from €15 million to
€30 million at March 31, 2022.

           A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a change in the accrual for social costs on outstanding
share-based compensation awards of €8 million and €10 million, respectively at March 31, 2022.

Investment Risk

            We are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our long term investments, due primarily to volatility in the share
price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of our long term investments relate to TME. A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share
price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from €560 million to €684 million at March 31, 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
            We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Preparing these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related
disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

            We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue, share-based compensation, content, warrants, Exchangeable Notes,
business combinations, the incremental borrowing rate, and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.




                                                                                - 37 -

           There have been no material changes or additions to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies
and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

         There are no new IFRS or IFRS Interpretation Committee ("IFRIC") interpretations effective for the three months ended March 31, 2022 that have a
material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

              We are from time to time subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other legal
proceedings involve highly complex issues, and often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, our potential liability with respect to a
large portion of such claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty. Management, with the assistance of legal counsel,
periodically reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation
when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of
litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. If management's estimates prove incorrect, current reserves
could be inadequate and we could incur a charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and
cash flows.

            For a discussion of legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 20 and Note 22 to our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

            Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F includes a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below
updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 20-F. Except as presented below,
there have been no material changes to our risk factors since those reported in Annual Report on Form 20-F.

            The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

             The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could lead to disruption, instability, and volatility in global markets and industries that could
negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. In response to the crisis, we have taken several steps, including suspending new
Premium account sign-ups in Russia in March 2022 and fully suspending our service in Russia as of April 11, 2022. While the suspension of our operations in
Russia did not have a material impact on our operating results, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine may have the effect of heightening many other
risks, including, but not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and business and consumer spending, and disruptions to
our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion, all of which could have a material adverse effect to our
business, operating results and financial condition.
