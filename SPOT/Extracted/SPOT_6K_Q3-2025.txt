Financial Summary
                                         Revenue of €4,272 million grew 7% Y/Y in Q3 (or 12% Y/Y constant currency*), reflecting:
Revenue
                                             ●        Premium Revenue growth of 9% Y/Y (or 13% Y/Y constant currency*), driven by subscriber gains; and
                                             ●        Ad-Supported Revenue decline of -6% Y/Y (or flat Y/Y constant currency*)
                                             ●        Unfavorable currency movements slowed Total Revenue Y/Y growth by ~450 bps vs. the ~490 bps
                                                      incorporated into our guidance



                                        Gross Margin was 31.6% in Q3, up 53 bps Y/Y reflecting:
Profitability
                                             ●       Premium decline driven by video podcast costs, partially offset by Revenue growth outpacing music costs
                                                     net of marketplace programs and audiobook costs; and
                                             ●       Ad-Supported gains driven by improved contribution from podcasts and music

                                        Operating Income was €582 million in Q3 and reflected the above, along with:

                                             ●       Higher costs associated with marketing, personnel and related costs (excluding Social Charges)
                                             ●       Operating Expenses included (€16) million in Social Charges

                                        At the end of Q3, our workforce consisted of 7,323 full-time employees globally

Free Cash Flow                          Free Cash Flow* was €806 million in Q3. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong, with €9.1 billion in
& Liquidity                             cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments.

Revenue
Premium growth driven by Subscriber gains
Premium Revenue grew 9% Y/Y to €3,826 million (or 13% Y/Y constant
currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 12% Y/Y and a Premium
ARPU** decline of -4% Y/Y to €4.53 (or flat Y/Y constant currency).
Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance was driven by price
increase benefits, offset by product/market mix.




Advertising business transformation continues
Ad-Supported Revenue declined -6% Y/Y (or flat Y/Y constant
currency*). On a constant currency basis, growth in music and podcast
advertising driven by growth in impressions sold was offset by softness in
pricing and optimization of our podcasting inventory in our Owned &
Licensed portfolio. Our automated sales channels remained the largest
contributors to overall advertising growth.

Gross Margin
Driven by continued improvement in Ad-Supported segment




 Gross Margin finished at 31.6% in Q3, up 53   Premium Gross Margin was 33.2% in Q3,          Ad-Supported Gross Margin was 18.4% in Q3,
 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven by          down 34 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven      up 525 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven by
 improvement in our Ad-Supported segment.      by video podcast costs (inclusive of costs     improved contribution from podcasts and

                                               segment), partially offset by Revenue growth
                                               outpacing music costs net of marketplace
                                               programs and audiobook costs.
Operating Expenses
Y/Y trend led by marketing and personnel costs

Operating Expenses declined 2% Y/Y in Q3. Absent the effects
of Y/Y movements in currency and Social Charges, the ~11%
Y/Y increase in Operating Expenses was driven primarily by an
increase in marketing and personnel and related costs. The
Y/Y increase in marketing was partially driven by campaign
timing, while the increase in personnel and related costs was
partially driven by a shift in the timing of annual equity grants.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue.
Share price movements this quarter resulted in Social Charges
coming in €41 million below forecast at (€16) million in current
period Operating Expenses. Prior year period Operating
Expenses included €53 million in Social Charges.

                 ** Last Twelve Months (LTM) represents annual performance covering the preceding 12 months relative to the last day of the quarter.
Free Cash Flow
Record Q3 performance aids balance sheet strength

Free Cash Flow* was €806 million in Q3, a record high
Q3 as a result of higher Net Income adjusted for non-cash
items, partially offset by movements in net working
capital. Capital expenditures rose €19 million Y/Y to €23
million.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged €1.3 billion of Free Cash Flow on a
trailing 12 month basis for the past three years. In Q3,
trailing 12 month Free Cash Flow expanded to €2.9
billion, supporting our strong balance sheet and €9.1
billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
short term investments balance.

We repurchased $77 million in shares in Q3. Year-to-date
through November 3rd, we repurchased $410 million in
shares.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating Income excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect,
and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit
excluding foreign exchange effect, and Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these
should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Income, Operating expense, or other financial measures prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make
investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash
flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS
Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important
factors may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and
services; competition for users, their time, and advertisers; risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth and the scope and complexity of our business; risks associated with our
new products or services and our emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to generate profit or positive cash flow
on a sustained basis; our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid evolving industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to
generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the
“Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and divestitures; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are
concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes;
the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order
to obtain licenses or comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the
dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or
the security of confidential information; undetected errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or vulnerabilities in our products and services; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of
third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us; risks relating to privacy and data security, content moderation, and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks
associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment acceptance-related risks; our dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled
employees; our ability to access additional capital to support strategic objectives; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions,
including inflation, changes in interest rates, changes in trade policies, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other
estimates; our ability to manage and remediate attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks
related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to
influence our governance and business; and risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from our estimates and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F
filed with the SEC on February 5, 2025, as updated by subsequent reports filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of
this shareholder update.

Social Charges Sensitivity
Meaningful movements in our stock price can lead to Social Charge variance


Our guidance incorporates the impact of Social Charges, the vast majority of which appear in Operating Expenses. The amount of
Social Charges we accrue for and ultimately pay can be volatile, as they are tied to the value of our share price. Since we do not
forecast stock price changes in our guidance, meaningful movements in our stock price over the course of a quarter can lead to
meaningful changes in Social Charges. As an example, at the Q3 close, our stock price was $698. In Q3, a 10% increase or decrease
in our stock price compared to the quarter-end price would have an approximate +/- €37M impact on Social Charges.
