Financial Summary
Revenue                                  Revenue of €3,636 million grew 20% Y/Y in Q1 (or 21% Y/Y constant currency*), reflecting:

                                             ●        Premium Revenue growth of 20% Y/Y (or 21% Y/Y constant currency*), driven by subscriber gains
                                                      and ARPU increases; and

                                        Gross Margin was 27.6% in Q1, up 243 bps Y/Y reflecting:
Profitability
                                             ●       Improved music and podcast profitability and
                                             ●       Other Costs of Revenue favorability, partially offset by
                                             ●       Audiobooks costs

                                        Operating Income was €168 million in Q1 and reflected:

                                             ●       €82 million in Social Charges, which were more than offset by
                                             ●       Lower personnel and related costs and marketing spend

                                        At the end of Q1, our workforce consisted of 7,721 full-time employees** globally

Revenue
Improved Premium growth led by ARPU acceleration
Premium Revenue grew 20% Y/Y to €3,247 million (or 21% Y/Y
constant currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 14% Y/Y and a
Premium ARPU increase of 5% Y/Y to €4.55 (or up 7% Y/Y constant
currency vs. 5% Y/Y in Q4’23). Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU
performance was driven by price increase benefits, partially offset by
product and market mix.

Improved Ad-Supported growth in music and podcasting
Ad-Supported revenue grew 18% Y/Y (or 19% Y/Y constant currency*),
reflecting double-digit Y/Y growth across all regions. Music advertising
revenue grew healthy double-digits Y/Y driven by growth in
impressions sold and increased pricing. Podcast advertising revenue
grew faster than music, driven by significant growth in impressions sold
across Original and Licensed podcasts and the Spotify Audience
Network, partially offset by softer pricing. The Spotify Audience
Network saw high single digit Q/Q growth in participating publishers
and shows.

Gross Margin
Music and podcast gains along with Other Cost of Revenue favorability aid Y/Y expansion




 Gross Margin finished at 27.6% in Q1, up 243    Premium Gross Margin was 30.2% in Q1, up        Ad-Supported Gross Margin was 6.4%
 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend reflects improvement     155 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend reflects             in Q1, up 947 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend reflects
 across music and podcasting and reductions      improvements in music profitability (aided by   improvement in podcast trends and music
 in Other Cost of Revenue, partially offset by   favorability in Marketplace) and Other Cost     profitability as well as Other Cost of Revenue
 audiobooks costs.                               of Revenue, partially offset by audiobooks      favorability.
                                                 costs.
Operating Expenses
Y/Y declines driven by increased focus on efficiency

Operating Expenses declined 9% Y/Y in Q1. Y/Y changes in
Social Charge movements elevated Y/Y expense growth by
~800 bps, while the lapping of the prior year charges related to
efficiency initiatives lowered expense growth by ~400 bps. The
remaining 13% Y/Y decline in Operating Expenses reflected a
decrease in personnel and related costs and lower marketing
spend. Currency movements had a <1% impact on reported
Operating Expense growth.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based
compensation of €82 million in the current period vs. €12
million in the prior year period.

Free Cash Flow
Building and sustaining a strong balance sheet

Free Cash Flow was €207 million in Q1, an increase Y/Y
as a result of higher Net Income adjusted for non-cash
items, partially offset by working capital headwinds
arising from severance payments associated with our
December workforce reduction and the timing of licensor
payments.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged approximately €275 million of positive
Free Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past
three years. On a cumulative basis, we have generated
over €2 billion of Free Cash Flow since the beginning of
2016, supporting our strong balance sheet and €4.7
billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
short term investments balance.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, and Operating
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, gross profit, Operating expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow
is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain
infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.
