MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (“MAUs”)

Total MAUs grew 18% Y/Y to 406 million in the quarter, up from 381 million last quarter and
near the top end of our guidance range. We saw double digit Y/Y growth in all regions with
particular strength in the Rest of World, which was led by strong results in India and Indonesia.
Latin America also outperformed expectations.

On December 1, 2021, we successfully launched the 7th annual year-end Spotify Wrapped
campaign to users in 103 markets. Collectively, 120 million MAUs engaged with Wrapped
content in Q4 (up 29% Y/Y) and there was strong Y/Y growth in engagement across all regions
and demographics. The campaign trended worldwide with nearly 60 million shares of Wrapped
stories and cards, triggering significant levels of consumption across our two personalized
playlists (Your Top Songs and Your Artists Revealed) which were responsible for almost 8% of
total on-platform consumption hours within 48 hours of launch.

PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS

Our Premium Subscribers grew 16% Y/Y to 180 million in the quarter, up from 172 million last
quarter and near the top end of the guidance range. All regions contributed to growth, led by
Europe and Latin America on an absolute Q/Q basis. Additionally, we tested a shortened
holiday promotional campaign for our Standard plan (4 weeks vs. 6 weeks in Q4 2020) which
shifted typical gross intake seasonality. Despite the two fewer weeks, campaign performance
exceeded expectations.

This quarter we also added several major promotional partnerships, including Xiaomi (Spotify
preloads on the world’s second largest phone manufacturer), Shopee (offering 3 month trials
with the number one eCommerce platform in Southeast Asia), Visa (offering 3 month trials in
India for credit and debit cardholders), and TecToy (Spotify preloads on TecToy mobile devices
in Brazil and 3 month trials available for TecToy customers who make an audio or technology
portfolio product purchase). Additionally, we renewed our reseller partnership with KPN, the
Netherlands' leading telecom operator.

FINANCIAL METRICS

Revenue
Revenue of €2,689 million grew 24% Y/Y in Q4 (or 20% Y/Y on a constant currency basis) and
was above the top end of our guidance range due to significant strength in advertising and
favorable FX movements. Premium Revenue grew 22% Y/Y to €2,295 million (or 18% Y/Y
constant currency) while Ad-Supported Revenue was particularly strong, growing 40% Y/Y to
€394 million (or 34% Y/Y constant currency).

Within Premium, average revenue per user (“ARPU”) of €4.40 in Q4 was up 3% Y/Y (or up 1%
Y/Y constant currency). Excluding the impact of FX, we saw a benefit to ARPU primarily from
our price increases.

Ad-Supported Revenue reached a record 15% of total revenues in the quarter and continued to
benefit from higher sold impressions, increased CPMs, and growing demand within the Spotify

                              42-44 avenue de la Gare, LU-1610 Luxembourg




                                                                                                 3
Audience Network. Podcast revenue strength was led by the Spotify Audience Network, where
we saw a significant increase in inventory in conjunction with increased CPMs. Additionally,
podcast revenue benefited from strong growth across existing Spotify studios and our exclusive
licensing deals.

During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Whooshkaa, a podcast technology platform
that offers a specialized tool for radio broadcasters to turn their existing audio content into on-
demand podcast content. This technology will be integrated into the Megaphone suite which will
bring more third-party content into the Spotify Audience Network, connect advertisers to more
audiences, and allow radio broadcasters to expand their reach and increase monetization.

Gross Margin
Gross Margin finished at 26.5% in Q4, above the top end of our guidance range and flat versus
the prior year period. The Gross Margin trend reflected a favorable revenue mix shift towards
podcasts, marketplace activity, and Other Cost of Revenue efficiencies (e.g. payment fees,
streaming delivery costs), which were offset by higher non-music and other content costs and
publishing rate increases. As a reminder, our Q4 2020 Gross Margin benefited from
adjustments to estimated music royalties that positively impacted Gross Margin by nearly 60
bps.

Premium Gross Margin was 29.2% in Q4, up 33 bps Y/Y, and Ad-Supported Gross Margin was
10.8% in Q4, or flat Y/Y. As a reminder, all content costs related to podcast investment are
included in the Ad-Supported business for the current and historical periods.

Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses totaled €719 million in Q4, an increase of 12% Y/Y. Social Charges were
above forecast given the increase in our share price during the quarter. Additionally, personnel
costs came in lower than expected as well as certain marketing expenses. Excluding the impact
of Social Charge movements, Operating Expenses were better than forecast and contributed to
positive Operating Income in the quarter.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and
benefits, including share-based compensation. We are subject to social taxes in several
countries in which we operate, although Sweden accounts for the bulk of the social costs. We
don’t forecast stock price changes in our guidance so upward or downward movements will
impact our reported operating expenses.

At the end of Q4, our workforce consisted of 7,690 FTEs globally.

Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow was €103 million in Q4, a €29 million increase Y/Y primarily due to an increase
in net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by higher working capital needs

arising from higher podcast-related payments and licensor payments. Capital expenditures
decreased €19 million due to finalization of various office build-outs in New York City,
Singapore, and Los Angeles.

At the end of Q4, we maintained a strong liquidity position with €3.6 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments.



PRODUCT AND PLATFORM UPDATES

Two-Sided Marketplace
The Two-Sided Marketplace exceeded our contribution expectations for Q4 and full year 2021
due to continued adoption of paid marketplace tools. Additionally, in October we announced a
new integration with Shopify that enables artists to link their Shopify store to their Spotify for
Artists account and post merchandise on their artist profile for fans around the world.

Podcasting
At the end of Q4, we had 3.6 million podcasts on the platform (up from 3.2 million at the end of
Q3) and were pleased to see a double digit increase in the number of MAUs that engaged with
podcast content relative to Q3. Among MAUs that engaged with podcasts in Q4, consumption
trends remained strong (up 20% Y/Y on a per user basis) and podcast share of overall
consumption hours on our platform reached another all-time high. We also expanded our paid
podcast subscriptions to creators and listeners in 33 additional markets and enabled podcasts
for users in Russia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.

Product Enhancements
During the quarter, we introduced several enhancements to our service aimed at driving user
engagement, retention, and conversion. These included the rollout of lyrics on mobile, desktop,
and smart TV platforms and extensions to our ubiquity strategy such as support for Alexa in
Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, a partnership with Peloton to match users with an
instructor based on their listening taste, an audio playback widget with Vivo, and an integration
with Apple’s SharePlay product which allows Spotify Premium users to share their favorite
content over FaceTime to enjoy a shared listening experience.

Audiobooks
During the quarter, we also accelerated our entry into the audiobook space through the
announcement of the agreement to acquire Findaway, a global leader in digital audiobook
distribution. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory review and approval.

Q1 2022 OUTLOOK

We are re-aligning our current guidance practice to better reflect how we run the business.
Since the vast majority of our initiatives are multi-year in nature and measured as such, we no
longer plan to issue annual guidance. However, we intend to utilize quarterly guidance as
checkpoints against our progress and will provide additional thoughts and perspective around
2022 expectations on our earnings call. As for quarterly guidance, going forward we will simplify
our approach by providing a single estimate for each metric instead of a range of outcomes.
Additionally, we plan to host an investor day later in 2022 to offer an update on the strength of
our platform and our advancement towards our long-term operating goals.

The following forward-looking statements reflect Spotify’s expectations for Q1 2022 as of
February 2, 2022 and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Given the extraordinary operating
circumstances we currently face with respect to the impact of COVID-19, there is a greater
likelihood of variances with respect to such point estimates than in typical quarters.

repurchased 300,724 ordinary shares for €59 million under the Share Repurchase program at a

Use of Non-IFRS Measures

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures:
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding
foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium
revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors
because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, Revenue excluding foreign
exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue
or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors
because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make
investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash
Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or
other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please
see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” table.
