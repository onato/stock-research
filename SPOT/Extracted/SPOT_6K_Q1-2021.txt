Dear Shareholders,1

We are pleased with our performance in Q1. The business delivered subscriber growth and
Gross Margin at the top end of our guidance range, a continued improvement in ARPU, and
operating income better than plan. We saw greater MAU variability this quarter, but results were
within our range of expectations given the outperformance in Q4 and the continued impact from
COVID-19. Revenue grew by 16% (22% excluding the impact of FX) and was at the upper end
of our guidance range. Other highlights from the quarter include a successful launch in 86 new
markets, a $1.5 billion Exchangeable Notes offering, and the acquisition of Betty Labs (Locker
Room).

MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (“MAUs”)

Total MAUs grew 24% Y/Y to 356 million in the quarter, finishing within our guidance range but
modestly below our internal expectations. In Q1, we added 11 million MAUs, which drove
healthy double digit Y/Y growth across all regions. We saw meaningful contributions from
markets such as the US, Mexico, Russia, and India. However, growth was lower than plan in
Latin America and Europe. In aggregate, the performance of our newly launched markets was in
line with our expectations.

Global consumption hours continued to grow meaningfully in Q1 on a Y/Y basis. Per user
consumption grew in developed regions such as North America and Europe, while developing
regions showed signs of improvement but remained below pre-COVID levels.

PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS

Our Premium Subscribers grew 21% Y/Y to 158 million in the quarter, hitting the top end of our
guidance range. In Q1, we added nearly 4 million subscribers, which drove healthy double digit
Y/Y growth across all regions and was strong relative to a tough promotional comparison from
Q1 last year. The subscriber outperformance was fairly broad based and led by North America,
where we saw stronger than expected performance of Trials & Campaigns and faster than
anticipated growth in our Standard product. In Latin America, we saw outperformance driven by
the continued success of our Family Plan product. We are pleased with the new market
contributions, with South Korea being the biggest driver.

Our average monthly Premium churn rate for the quarter was down modestly Y/Y and flat Q/Q.
The Y/Y improvement continues to be driven by the adoption of our higher retention offerings
like Family Plan in addition to growth in high retention regions.

FINANCIAL METRICS

Revenue
Total revenue of €2,147 million grew 16% Y/Y in Q1 (22% Y/Y on a constant currency basis).
Reported revenue was toward the top end of our guidance range due to subscriber
outperformance, slightly lower headwinds from FX (600 bps impact vs. 770 bps incorporated
into our plan), and advertising strength. The FX impact was primarily driven by the Y/Y US dollar
weakness vs. the Euro. Premium revenue grew 14% Y/Y to €1,931 million (or 19% Y/Y in
constant currency terms) while Ad-Supported revenue was particularly strong, growing 46% Y/Y
to €216 million (or 57% Y/Y in constant currency terms).

Within Premium, average revenue per user (“ARPU”) of €4.12 in Q1 was down 7% Y/Y (but
down only 1% Y/Y in constant currency terms vs. down 3% Y/Y in Q4). Excluding FX, product
mix accounted for the majority of the ARPU decline. To date, we have raised prices across a
variety of our Premium offerings in over 30 markets and early results have shown no material
impacts to gross intake or cancellation rates. On April 26th, we announced price increases for
various subscription products in 12 additional markets, including the United States (Family
Plan), United Kingdom (Student, Family, and Duo Plans), and Brazil (Full Portfolio).

Ad-Supported revenue outperformed our forecast with all regions growing double digits Y/Y
excluding the impact of FX. The strength in Ad-Supported revenue was led by our Podcast and
Programmatic channels, with the former benefiting from the acquisitions of Megaphone and The
Ringer along with our exclusive licensing of the Joe Rogan Experience. Spotify Ad Studio grew
substantially Y/Y, and we continued to expand the self-serve offering to more markets (France,
Germany, and Italy) and began beta testing podcast inventory ad buying on Spotify Ad Studio in
the US. Additionally, in April, we expanded Streaming Ad Insertion (“SAI”) from the US, Canada,
United Kingdom, and Germany to also include Australia and Sweden.

In February, we announced the Spotify Audience Network, a first-of-its-kind audio advertising
marketplace which connects advertisers to listeners across Spotify Owned & Exclusive (“O&E”)
podcasts, podcasts from enterprise publishers via Megaphone, podcasts from emerging
creators via Anchor, and ad-supported music. The Spotify Audience Network bundles multiple
shows for advertisers to buy specific audiences using our proprietary SAI technology. We
believe this shift will provide advertisers much greater reach and efficiency while creators gain a
much greater monetization opportunity.

Gross Margin
Gross Margin finished at 25.5% in Q1, at the top end of our guidance range and flat Y/Y. While
we continue to see strong revenue growth in podcast and non-music revenue, our non-music
costs continue to grow at a slightly faster rate which is a modest drag on our Gross Margin. We
did see improvements in Other Cost of Revenue (e.g. payment fees, streaming delivery costs)
which offset the content spend increase.

Premium Gross Margin was 27.9% in Q1, down 42 bps Y/Y and Ad-Supported Gross Margin
was 4.4% in Q1, up 1,100 bps Y/Y. As a reminder, all content costs related to podcast
investment are included in the Ad-Supported business for the current and historical periods.

Operating Expenses / Income (Loss)
Operating Expenses totaled €534 million in Q1, an increase of 9% Y/Y and below our plan.
Social Charges were approximately €35 million lower than forecast due to a decrease in our
share price during the quarter, accounting for the majority of our Operating Expense variance.
Excluding the impact of our share price volatility, Operating Expenses grew less than forecast at
14% Y/Y. Certain marketing expenses came in lower than expected due to campaign timing
shifts, which were partially offset by higher than expected personnel expenses.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and
benefits, including share-based compensation. We are subject to social taxes in several
countries in which we operate, although Sweden accounts for the bulk of the social costs. We
don’t forecast stock price changes in our guidance so upward or downward movements will
impact our reported operating expenses.

At the end of Q1, our workforce consisted of 6,794 FTEs globally.

Product and Platform
On March 29, 2021, we acquired Betty Labs, the creators of Locker Room, a live audio app
that’s changing the way insiders and fans talk about sports. This acquisition builds on our work
to create “future formats of audio” and will accelerate Spotify’s entry into the live audio space.
We plan to evolve and expand Locker Room into an enhanced live audio experience for a wider
range of creators and fans. Through this new live experience, Spotify will offer a range of sports,
music, and cultural programming, as well as a host of interactive features that will enable
creators to connect with audiences in real time. We intend to give professional athletes, writers,
musicians, songwriters, podcasters, and other global voices opportunities to host real-time
discussions, debates, ask me anything (AMA) sessions, and more.

During the quarter, Spotify launched multiple upgrades, including a new Desktop App and Web
Player redesign that makes the user experience and navigation easier than ever by combining a
modern scalable web player together with a cohesive Spotify design. Additionally, our web
platform includes 36 new languages (62 in total), which also will be rolled out to the mobile app,
allowing Spotify to reach more audiences.

We also began testing Podcast Topic Search in the US, which enables listeners to search for
podcasts by theme and topic in an effort to make discovering new content easier than ever. In
February, we announced a new partnership between Anchor and WordPress to generate
opportunities for content creators to evolve their work and reach new audiences through the
power of audio. With this new tool, bloggers can publish their written content as a podcast with
just a few clicks—and podcasters can create a website for their podcast just as easily. This
offers a whole new group of creators—those who have historically focused on the written
word—to access an entirely new audience via audio and share their voices on Spotify.

We remain focused on our ubiquity strategy and continue to expand support for Spotify across a
variety of platforms and markets. With the expansion of our footprint into non-music content, we
also have expanded support for video podcasts on AppleTV (including AirPlay2), LG, and
Comcast. At the end of Q1, users in 10 additional markets, including Sweden, Australia, and
Chile, can now ask Alexa to play podcasts from Spotify. Additionally, PlayStation's PS4 and
PS5 consoles now support Spotify in 5 new markets, including Russia, Ukraine, Croatia,
Slovenia, and Israel.

Post Q1, we announced a limited launch of Car Thing to eligible US users. Car Thing is a smart
player that allows users to more seamlessly engage with Spotify music, news, entertainment,
talk, and more in the car. We also launched a joint partnership with Facebook to create an
integrated ecosystem with a miniplayer experience driven by social discovery that allows
listeners to enjoy audio from Spotify directly within Facebook, without switching between apps.
Additionally, we announced new ways for podcast creators to monetize their work with the
rollout of Spotify’s Paid Subscriptions, the Spotify Open Access Platform, and utilization of the
Spotify Audience Network for independent creators. These initiatives provide creators with
different options to monetize their work, which allows them to continue to grow their audiences
and create meaningful revenue streams.

Content
At the end of Q1, we had 2.6 million podcasts on the platform (up from more than 2.2 million
podcasts by the end of Q4). The percentage of MAUs that engaged with podcast content on our
platform was consistent with Q4 levels. From a consumption standpoint, we saw a strong
increase in Q1 podcast consumption hours vs. Q4, with March activity driving an all-time high in
terms of podcast share of overall platform consumption hours.

The Joe Rogan Experience performed above expectations with respect to new user additions
and engagement. Notable Q1 content launches in the US included Renegades: Born in the USA
(Higher Ground), Unlocking Us with Brene Brown (Parcast), Ringer Dish Feed - Taylor Swift
(The Ringer), and Welcome To Your Fantasy (Gimlet). Renegades: Born in the USA, featuring
former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen, was the second largest podcast on
Spotify in March (on an MAU basis) and has been our most international show to-date, with
listenership extending across more than 150 countries. Internationally, we released 55 new
O&E podcasts. Select launches included a Japanese original Juju Talk, which was a major
driver of user acquisition in the country, as well as our first daily new original in Germany,
FOMO - was hab ich heute verpasst (what did I miss today?). Additionally, we launched our first
slate of 7 Spotify Originals in the Philippines, with topics ranging from gaming to well-being,
featuring personalities like Pia Wurtzbach and Donnalyn Bartolome.

On the music front, key Q1 releases included Olivia Rodrigo’s single, drivers license, which set
the Spotify record for most streams in a day for a non-holiday song with over 15 million global
streams on January 11. Additional releases include Arlo Parks’ album, Collapsed in Sunbeams,
as well as Selena Gomez’s EP, Revelación. Daft Punk and Spotify partnered to celebrate the
20th anniversary of their highly acclaimed 2001 opus Discovery with an enhanced playlist
experience after the announcement of the duo splitting up. The playlist included exclusive
Canvas and Storylines for every track on the album, and since the start of the campaign, Daft
Punk has seen a double digit increase in follows on-platform.

Two-Sided Marketplace
Sponsored Recommendations have shown strong growth and are becoming an essential part of
new release marketing strategies for artists and labels. Q1 was the biggest quarter yet for
Sponsored Recommendations, with an 11% increase over campaign volume from last quarter
and a 10% increase in new customers vs. Q4. In an effort to expand and evolve Sponsored
Recommendations, we expanded into Australia and New Zealand and have now made this tool
available for singles. Additionally, we began the rollout of a self-serve buying experience for
Sponsored Recommendations to select artist and label teams in the US.

At our Stream On event, we announced that we’re testing a new commercial tool called
Discovery Mode with a small group of labels that enables artists to better reach new audiences
on Spotify. To ensure the tool is accessible to artists at any stage of their careers, it will not
require any upfront budget and instead, labels or rights holders agree to be paid a promotional
recording royalty rate for streams in personalized listening sessions where we provided this

service. Early results from the labels participating have been positive with participating labels
seeing a 30% increase in streams for content opted in on average.

This quarter, we announced that all artists now have access to our popular feature, Canvas,
through Spotify for Artists. The Canvas for Rodrigo’s drivers license was shared from Spotify to
Instagram Stories over 243,000 times in its first week alone and was viewed more than 50
million times in its first three weeks. Artists at every stage of their career have used Canvas, and
we now have over 1 million Canvases live on Spotify.

In Q1, we launched Noteable — our new global home for songwriters, producers and publishers
which is a central space to access all the resources we’ve made available to the songwriting
and publishing community, including Spotify Publishing Analytics, SoundBetter, Songwriter
Pages and Song Credits, the Songwriting Hub, and more.

Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow was €41 million in Q1, a €61 million increase Y/Y as the prior year included an
unfavorable impact to working capital due to a shift in timing for select licensor payments as well
as an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items. These increases were partially offset
by higher cash outflow for PP&E.

In addition to the positive Free Cash Flow dynamics, we maintain a strong liquidity position and
are confident in the financial position of the business. During Q1, Spotify USA Inc. issued $1.5
billion in aggregate principal amount, zero coupon Exchangeable Notes due 2026 with a 70%
conversion premium. At the end of Q1, we had €3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, and short term investments.


Q2 & 2021 OUTLOOK

The following forward-looking statements reflect Spotify’s expectations as of April 28, 2021 and
are subject to substantial uncertainty. The estimates below utilize the same methodology we’ve
used in prior quarters with respect to our guidance and the potential range of outcomes. Given
the extraordinary operating circumstances we currently face with respect to the impact of
COVID-19, there is a greater likelihood of variances with respect to those ranges than typical
quarters.

Q2 2021 Guidance:

   ●   Total MAUs: 366-373 million
   ●   Total Premium Subscribers: 162-166 million
   ●   Total Revenue: €2.16-€2.36 billion
          ○ Assumes approximately 200 bps headwind to growth Y/Y due to movements in
              foreign exchange rates
   ●   Gross Margin: 23.6-25.6%

     ●    Operating Profit/Loss: €(134)-€(54) million

Full Year 2021 Guidance: We have modestly lowered our Total MAUs range for the full year
consistent with the lower than expected Q1 Total MAU growth. Additionally, we have increased
our outlook for Total Revenue and Gross Margin, as well as decreased the Operating Loss
expectations. Our Premium Subscriber outlook remains unchanged.

     ●    Total MAUs: 402-422 million
     ●    Total Premium Subscribers: 172-184 million
     ●    Total Revenue: €9.11-€9.51 billion
             ○ Assumes approximately 75 bps headwind to growth Y/Y due to movements in
                 foreign exchange rates
     ●    Gross Margin: 24.0-26.0%
     ●    Operating Profit/Loss: €(250)-€(150) million

Use of Non-IFRS Measures

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures:
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding
foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium
revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors
because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, Revenue excluding foreign
exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue
or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors

because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make
investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash
Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or
other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see
