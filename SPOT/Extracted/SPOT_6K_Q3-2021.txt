Dear Shareholders, 1

The business performed very well in the quarter. Nearly all of our major metrics finished better
than expected, including MAUs, Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Income. Subscriber
growth was inline and importantly, ARPU growth increased Y/Y. Additionally, we saw another
quarter of significant advertising strength and user engagement metrics across many markets
showed encouraging signs of growth. During the quarter, we generated positive Free Cash Flow
of €99 million.

 Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure. See “Use of Non-IFRS Measures” and “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” for
additional information.

MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (“MAUs”)

Total MAUs grew 19% Y/Y to 381 million in the quarter, up from 365 million last quarter and
near the top end of our guidance range. We experienced double digit Y/Y growth in all regions
with particular strength in Rest of World where performance was aided by the resumption of
marketing activity in India along with above-plan growth in the Philippines and Indonesia. We
also saw improved momentum across the 86 markets launched earlier this year, with
outperformance led by South Korea, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.

PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS

Our Premium Subscribers grew 19% Y/Y to 172 million in the quarter, up from 165 million last
quarter and towards the midpoint of the guidance range. We tested a Premium promotion in the
third quarter, which aided the typical seasonality of our business and also helped offset the
tough comp from the successful launch of Russia and surrounding territories in Q3 last year.

This quarter we added several major promotional partnerships, including HMD Global (Spotify
preloads on select Nokia branded smartphones and tablets across all 178 markets), LG U+
(offering 3 or 6 month trials in South Korea with one of the country’s largest telcos), OnePlus
(Spotify preloads on OnePlus mobile devices in India with 3 or 6 month trials and a limited offer
of 12 month trials to OnePlus Red Cable Club members), PayMaya (supporting pre-paid
payment solutions for Spotify's daily, weekly and monthly subscriptions and offering 7 day trials
in the Philippines), and Tinkoff (offering 3 month trials with Russia’s largest all-digital bank).

Additionally, we renewed our partnership with Spark, New Zealand’s largest telco and digital
services company, offering bundling and reseller opportunities.

Our average monthly Premium churn rate for the quarter was down sequentially and up Y/Y
against last year’s historic low. We are pleased with the trends in churn and continue to expect
full year 2021 churn to be down versus 2020.

FINANCIAL METRICS

Revenue
Revenue of €2,501 million grew 27% Y/Y in Q3 (or 26% Y/Y on a constant currency basis) and
was at the top end of our guidance range due to significant strength in advertising. Premium
Revenue grew 22% Y/Y to €2,178 million (or 21% Y/Y constant currency) while Ad-Supported
Revenue was particularly strong, growing 75% Y/Y to €323 million (or 75% Y/Y constant
currency).

Within Premium, average revenue per user (“ARPU”) of €4.34 in Q3 was up 4% Y/Y (or up 3%
Y/Y constant currency vs. flat Y/Y in Q2). Excluding the impact of FX, we saw a benefit to ARPU
primarily from our price increases.

Ad-Supported Revenue meaningfully outperformed, driven by higher sold impressions,
increased CPMs, and accelerated demand within the Spotify Audience Network. The strength in
advertising was broad-based across all sales channels, with the United States and United
                                          Spotify Technology S.A.
                               42-44 avenue de la Gare, LU-1610 Luxembourg




                                                                                                   3
Kingdom meaningfully exceeding expectations. Our music business was driven by growth in
impressions, a meaningful improvement in sell-through rate, and double-digit CPM growth. Our
Podcast business was driven by strong double-digit Y/Y growth at existing Spotify studios (The
Ringer, Parcast, Spotify Studios, and Gimlet) along with the Megaphone acquisition and the
exclusive licensing of the Joe Rogan Experience, Armchair Expert with Dax Shephard, and Call
Her Daddy.

During Q3, the Spotify Audience Network continued to gain traction in the United States while
expanding into the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The Spotify Audience Network
continued to outperform in the quarter, driven by higher available inventory and incremental
revenue from international sales. Since launch, the number of podcasts in our network has
grown by more than 50%, and nearly 1 in 5 Spotify advertisers are already participating. The
Spotify Audience Network will open to top emerging podcast creators from Anchor in the coming
weeks, increasing the scale and reach for our advertisers.

Gross Margin
Gross Margin finished at 26.7% in Q3, above the top end of our guidance range and reflecting
nearly 200 bps of Y/Y expansion. The Gross Margin improvement reflected a favorable revenue
mix shift towards podcasts, marketplace activity, improved music advertising operating
leverage, and Other Cost of Revenue efficiencies (e.g. payment fees, streaming delivery costs),
which were partially offset by higher non-music and other content costs and publishing rate
increases.

Premium Gross Margin was 29.1% in Q3, up 182 bps Y/Y, and Ad-Supported Gross Margin was
10.5% in Q3, up 993 bps Y/Y. As a reminder, all content costs related to podcast investment are
included in the Ad-Supported business for the current and historical periods.

Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses totaled €593 million in Q3, an increase of 12% Y/Y. Social Charges were
below forecast given the decline in our share price during the quarter. Additionally, personnel
costs came in lower than expected as well as certain marketing expenses. Excluding the impact
of Social Charge movements, Operating Expenses were better than forecast and contributed to
positive Operating Income in the quarter.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and
benefits, including share-based compensation. We are subject to social taxes in several
countries in which we operate, although Sweden accounts for the bulk of the social costs. We
don’t forecast stock price changes in our guidance so upward or downward movements will
impact our reported operating expenses.

At the end of Q3, our workforce consisted of 7,431 FTEs globally.

Product and Platform
During the quarter, we continued to lean into the personalization of our user experiences to help
drive improved intake, retention, conversion, and LTV. Key product rollouts included: Blend (the
ability for two users to merge their music into one shared playlist), Enhance (the ability for
Premium users to add personalized recommendations to their playlists), Episodes for You
(episodic podcast level recommendations), and What’s New (a feed that gathers all new
releases from the artists and shows that users follow).

In late August, we opened up our paid podcast subscriptions to all US creators with intentions to
expand internationally to both more creators and users. Additionally, we announced the launch
of Q&A and polls for Anchor creators, which allows listeners to respond to short questions
posed by show creators. We also expanded the rollout of the Music + Talk format to 15 new
markets, bringing this format to 21 markets around the world.

During the quarter, we advanced our product ubiquity efforts in several areas. We announced a
partnership with Delta Airlines that allows passengers to discover Spotify-curated music and
podcasts within Delta’s in-flight entertainment system. Additionally, we deepened our
partnership with Roku, launching a pre-loaded playback stack, Spotify Connect discoverability,
video podcast playback, and support for Roku’s voice assistant. In August, Spotify launched a
new smartwatch experience supporting offline and direct streaming on Google’s new Wear OS
3 platform (deployed with key brands such as Samsung, Fossil, and Mobvoi).

Within Two-Sided Marketplace, we continued to test Discovery Mode with record labels and
distributors, where we saw Q/Q growth in customers and Gross Profit contribution. Sponsored
Recommendations (i.e. Marquee) also continued to gain traction during the third quarter as we
expanded into more international markets including France, Monaco, Switzerland, Germany,
Austria, and Liechtenstein.

Content
At the end of Q3, we had 3.2 million podcasts on the platform (up from 2.9 million at the end of
Q2). The percentage of MAUs that engaged with podcast content continued to increase
throughout the quarter, marking an acceleration relative to Q2 trends. Among MAUs that
engaged with podcasts in Q3, consumption trends remained strong (up 20% Y/Y on a per user
basis) while month-over-month retention rates continued to trend positively. During the quarter,
podcast share of overall consumption hours on our platform also reached an all-time high.

In the United States, we released 32 new Originals & Exclusives (“O&E”) in the quarter,
including the exclusivity launches of Armchair Expert with Dax Sheppard and Call Her Daddy in
July. We also announced a multi-year audio content partnership between The Ringer and WWE
to develop original and exclusive audio content, as well as live audio discussions hosted on
Spotify Greenroom after every big WWE pay-per-view event.

Internationally, we released 76 new O&E podcasts, with notable traction in India and Latin
America where Originals have been helpful in stimulating new user acquisition. Top performing
shows in these markets include: Mythpat (India), Mano a Mano (Brazil), Paciente 63 (Caso 63
adaptation in Brazil), and Virus 2062 (Caso 63 adaptation in India). In Sweden, we announced
seven new Spotify Originals from some of the most popular artists and talents in the country,
including Spotify’s first Swedish podcast with video, Bakom micken med Filip Dikmen.

During the quarter, our music slate also saw significant new release activity. In late August,
Kanye West’s 10th studio album, Donda, arrived, with 16 tracks from the album occupying the
top 25 of the Spotify Global Top 50 daily chart and the entire top 10 of the Spotify US Top 50.
Drake also released his highly anticipated 6th studio album Certified Lover Boy, breaking the
record for the most-streamed album in a day in Spotify history with over 150 million streams.
Spotify launched a global partnership with Drake including an offer for fans and new users to
stream the album free on-demand for the first two weeks of release. Billie Eilish released a long-
anticipated album, Happier Than Ever, in late July which included Spotify’s first-ever artist hub
with Happier Than Ever: The Destination. The Destination features three enhanced albums with
exclusive video and audio content from Billie across the three playlists: Billie Mode, Lyric Mode,
and Fan Mode. Other major releases in the quarter included J Balvin’s album, JOSE, Kacey
Musgraves’ album, star-crossed, Lil Nas X’s album, Montero, and NCT 127’s album, Sticker.

Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow was €99 million in Q3, a €4 million decrease Y/Y primarily due to an increase in
net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by higher working capital needs arising
from higher ad receivables, podcast-related payments, and licensor payments. Capital
expenditures decreased €8 million Y/Y largely due to finalization of various office build outs in
New York City, Singapore, and LA.

At the end of Q3, we maintained a strong liquidity position with €3.3 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments.


Q4 2021 OUTLOOK

The following forward-looking statements reflect Spotify’s expectations as of October 27, 2021
and are subject to substantial uncertainty. The estimates below utilize the same methodology
we’ve used in prior quarters with respect to our guidance and the potential range of outcomes.
Given the extraordinary operating circumstances we currently face with respect to the impact of
COVID-19, there is a greater likelihood of variances with respect to those ranges than typical
quarters.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures:
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding
foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium
revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors
because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, Revenue excluding foreign
exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue
or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors
because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make
investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash
Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or
other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see
“Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” table.
