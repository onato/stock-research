Revenue                                  Revenue of €3,177 million grew 11% Y/Y in Q2 (or 14% Y/Y constant currency*), reflecting:

                                        Gross Margin was 24.1% in Q2, down 47 bps Y/Y due to €44 million in net charges primarily related to the shut

                                        Operating Loss of (€247) million in Q2 was impacted by €135 million in net charges. These charges include the

Revenue
Consistent Premium growth, led by subscribers
Premium Revenue grew 11% Y/Y to €2,773 million (or 14% Y/Y constant
currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 17% Y/Y and a Premium
ARPU* decline of 6% Y/Y to €4.27 (or down 3% constant currency*).
Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance was impacted by
product and market mix.


Broad based Ad-Supported growth
Ad-Supported revenue grew 12% Y/Y (or 15% Y/Y constant currency*),
reflecting double-digit Y/Y growth across nearly all regions. Music
advertising revenue grew mid single-digits Y/Y, reflecting double-digit
Y/Y growth in impressions sold, partially offset by softer pricing due to
the macroeconomic environment. Podcast advertising revenue growth
re-accelerated to more than 30% Y/Y with sold impressions across
Original and Licensed podcasts and the Spotify Audience Network hitting
an all-time-high, partially offset by softer pricing. The Spotify Audience
Network saw double digit Q/Q growth in participating advertisers and
publishers and high single digit Q/Q growth in participating shows.

Operating Expenses
Primarily driven by efficiency related charges

Operating Expenses grew 13% Y/Y (or 16% constant
currency*), driven predominantly by charges related to
efficiency efforts of €91 million (contributing ~1,000 bps to Y/Y
Operating Expense growth), of which roughly €83 million were
related to real-estate impairments and the remaining €8 million
were severance-related and other charges. Additionally, Y/Y
changes in Social Charge movements of €35 million impacted
Y/Y expense growth by 400 bps. All remaining Operating
Expense growth reflected higher personnel costs related to Y/Y
headcount growth and acquisitions, partially offset by lower
marketing and legal costs in the quarter.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based
compensation of €25 million in the current period vs. (€10)
million in the prior year period.

            of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” for additional information.
Free Cash Flow
Building and sustaining a strong balance sheet

Free Cash Flow was €9 million in Q2, a decrease Y/Y as
a result of reduced favorability in net working capital
specifically related to the timing of certain payments in
Q2. Additionally, capital expenditures declined €3 million
Y/Y to €2 million as a result of the completion of office
build-outs.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged approximately €200 million of positive
Free Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past
three years. On a cumulative basis, we have generated
€1.4 billion of Free Cash Flow since the beginning of
2016, supporting our strong balance sheet and €3.5
billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
short term investments balance.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, Premium adjusted gross margin, Ad-Supported
adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income/(loss), adjusted operating margin and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign
exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange impact, adjusted gross margin, Premium adjusted
gross margin, Ad-Supported adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income/(loss) and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical
performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Operating expense, gross profit, gross margin, Premium gross
margin, ad-supported gross margin, operating loss, and operating margin or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it
presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or
non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance
with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Forward Looking Statements
This shareholder update contains estimates and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The words “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “would,”
“should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “seek,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “contemplate,” “possible,” and similar words are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.
Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important
factors may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and
services; competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers; risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth; risks associated with our new products or services and our
emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to be profitable or generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis; our
ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid emerging industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to generate revenues from
podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the “Service”); risks relating to
acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are concentrated and can
unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes; the limitations on our
operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order to obtain licenses or
comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the dependence of streaming on
operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology structure and systems or the security of confidential
information; undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities in our products; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us;
risks relating to privacy and data security; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment-related risks; our
dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees; our ability to access to additional capital to support growth; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and interest rates, financial market volatility resulting from recent bank
failures, the continued conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to manage and remediate attempts to manipulate
streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of our operating results and
fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and risks related to our status as a
foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from our estimates and forward-looking
statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 2, 2023, as updated by subsequent reports filed
with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder update.

Rounding
Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included in this update have been subject to rounding adjustments. The sum of individual metrics may not always equal total amounts indicated due to rounding.

Total Gross Margin Adjustments
All charges related to efficiency related activities were not included in guidance




           *Adjusted Gross Margin is a non-IFRS measure. See "Use of Non-IFRS Measures" and "Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results" for additional information.   34
Social Charges Sensitivity
Meaningful movements in our stock price can lead to Social Charge variance


Our guidance incorporates the impact of Social Charges, the vast majority of which appear in Operating Expenses. The amount of
Social Charges we accrue for and ultimately pay can be volatile, as they are tied to the value of our share price. Since we do not
forecast stock price changes in our guidance, meaningful movements in our stock price over the course of a quarter can lead to
meaningful changes in Social Charges. As an example, at the Q2 close, our stock price was $160.55. In Q3, a 10% increase or
decrease in our stock price compared to the quarter-end price would have an approximate +/- €18M impact on Social Charges.
