                                                      ARPU increases; and
                                             ●        Ad-Supported Revenue growth of 8% Y/Y (or 5% Y/Y constant currency*)
                                             ●        Currency movements aided Total Revenue Y/Y growth by ~20 bps vs. the ~90 bps incorporated into our
                                                      guidance


                                        Gross Margin was 31.6% in Q1, up 403 bps Y/Y reflecting:
Profitability
                                             ●       Premium gains driven by audiobooks and music; and
                                             ●       Ad-Supported gains driven by podcasts, music and Other Costs of Revenue

                                        Operating Income was €509 million in Q1 and reflected the above, along with:

                                             ●       Lower personnel and related costs and lower marketing spend
                                             ●       Operating Expenses included €75 million in Social Charges

                                        At the end of Q1, our workforce consisted of 7,258 full-time employees globally

Free Cash Flow                          Free Cash Flow* was €534 million in Q1. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong, with €8.0 billion in

Revenue
Premium growth driven by Subscriber and ARPU gains
Premium Revenue grew 16% Y/Y to €3,771 million (or 16% Y/Y constant
currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 12% Y/Y and a Premium
ARPU increase of 4% Y/Y to €4.73 (or up 4% Y/Y constant currency*).
Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance was driven by price
increase benefits, partially offset by product/market mix.


Advertising growth across music and podcasting
Ad-Supported Revenue grew 8% Y/Y (or 5% Y/Y constant currency*).
Music and podcast advertising was driven by growth in impressions sold,
partially offset by softness in pricing and optimization of our podcasting
inventory in our Owned & Licensed portfolio. Our automated sales
channels were the largest contributors to overall advertising growth.

Gross Margin
Driven by continued improvement across Premium and Ad-Supported segments




 Gross Margin finished at 31.6% in Q1, up 403   Premium Gross Margin was 33.5% in Q1, up   Ad-Supported Gross Margin was 15.3%
 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven by           332 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven by   in Q1, up 885 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was
 improvements in our Premium and                favorability from audiobooks and music.    driven by favorability from podcasts, music
 Ad-Supported segments.                                                                    and Other Costs of Revenue.
Operating Expenses
Y/Y declines led by timing factors

Operating Expenses declined 2% Y/Y in Q1. Absent the effects
of Y/Y movements in currency and Social Charges, the 3% Y/Y
decline in Operating Expenses was driven primarily by a
decrease in personnel and related costs and lower marketing
spend. The decrease in personnel and related costs was
primarily driven by a shift in the timing of annual equity grants
from Q1 to Q2.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based
compensation of €75 million in current period Operating
Expenses. Prior year period Operating Expenses included €82
million in Social Charges.

                 * Last Twelve Months (LTM) represents annual performance covering the preceding 12 months relative to the last day of the quarter.
                 ** Social Charges Related to Equity Awards is net of FX movements, which had an approximate 900 bps favorable impact to the Y/Y change of this line item.
Free Cash Flow
Record Q1 performance aids balance sheet strength

Free Cash Flow* was €534 million in Q1, a record high
Q1 as a result of higher Net Income adjusted for
non-cash items and improving net working capital.
Capital expenditures rose €1 million Y/Y to €6 million.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged €857 million of positive Free Cash
Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past three
years. In Q1, trailing 12 month Free Cash Flow
expanded to €2.6 billion. On a cumulative basis, we
have generated €4.8 billion of Free Cash Flow since the
beginning of 2016, supporting our strong balance sheet
and €8.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash and short term investments balance.




                * Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure. See "Use of Non-IFRS Measures" and "Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results" for additional information" to be consistent with other slides. Last Twelve Months (LTM)
                represents annual performance covering the preceding 12 months relative to the last day of the quarter. Cume represents cumulative performance since the beginning of 2016.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, and Operating
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Gross Profit, Operating expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash
Flow is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude
certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important
factors may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and

new products or services and our emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to generate profit or positive cash flow
on a sustained basis; our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid evolving industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to
generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the
“Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and divestitures; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are
concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes;
the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order
to obtain licenses or comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the
dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or
the security of confidential information; undetected errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or vulnerabilities in our products and services; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of
third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us; risks relating to privacy and data security, content moderation, and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks
associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment acceptance-related risks; our dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled
employees; our ability to access additional capital to support strategic objectives; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions,
including inflation, changes in interest rates, changes in trade policies, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other
estimates; our ability to manage and remediate attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks
related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to
influence our governance and business; and risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from our estimates and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F
filed with the SEC on February 5, 2025, as updated by subsequent reports filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of
this shareholder update.

Social Charges Sensitivity
Meaningful movements in our stock price can lead to Social Charge variance


Our guidance incorporates the impact of Social Charges, the vast majority of which appear in Operating Expenses. The amount of
Social Charges we accrue for and ultimately pay can be volatile, as they are tied to the value of our share price. Since we do not
forecast stock price changes in our guidance, meaningful movements in our stock price over the course of a quarter can lead to
meaningful changes in Social Charges. As an example, at the Q1 close, our stock price was $550.03. In Q1, a 10% increase or
decrease in our stock price compared to the quarter-end price would have an approximate +/- €33M impact on Social Charges.
