Dear Shareholders,1

Most of our major metrics -- Subscriber growth, Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Income
-- performed better than expected this quarter. The exception was MAUs, where we fell short of
our guidance range. The quarter was led by improving ARPU, decreased churn, a return to per
user consumption growth, and significant advertising strength. We did see a second quarter of
greater MAU variability mainly due to ongoing COVID-19 headwinds and a temporary issue
related to user intake on a third party platform. However, trends improved in the back half of the
quarter. Additionally, we generated positive Free Cash Flow of €34 million.

 Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure. See “Use of Non-IFRS Measures” and “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” for
additional information.

MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (“MAUs”)

Total MAUs grew 22% Y/Y to 365 million in the quarter, finishing below our guidance range and
forecast. Despite our underperformance, we added 9 million MAUs in Q2, which drove double
digit Y/Y growth in all regions.

MAU performance was slower than expected due primarily to lighter user intake during the first
half of the quarter. COVID-19 continued to weigh on our performance in several markets, and,
in some instances, we paused marketing campaigns due to the severity of the pandemic.
Separately, a user sign-up issue associated with a global third party platform created
unexpected intake friction, which also impacted MAU growth. This issue has since been
resolved.

Overall, we saw a return to better growth patterns in the back half of the quarter. Although we
continue to face near-term uncertainty with respect to COVID-19, we remain confident in the
underlying health of our user funnel, and our existing user retention activity remains consistent
with historical trends.

Global consumption hours continued to grow meaningfully in Q2 on a Y/Y basis. On a per user
basis, global consumption levels returned to Y/Y growth in the quarter, led by gains in
developed regions such as North America and Europe.

PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS

Our Premium Subscribers grew 20% Y/Y to 165 million in the quarter, towards the upper end of
our guidance range and modestly ahead of forecast. We added 7 million subscribers in Q2,
which drove healthy double digit Y/Y growth across all regions. We saw strong performance of
our Standard product across both Europe and North America.

Compared with the last few years, we shortened our mid-year promotional campaign cycle from
6 weeks to 4 weeks, and performance exceeded expectations. Additionally, we added or
expanded several major promotional partnerships in the quarter, including a renewal and
expansion of our Samsung promotion (offering 3 month trials in 73 markets to all new and
existing mobile/speaker/wearable and appliance devices), a renewal and expansion of our
Microsoft Gamepass promotion (offering 3 or 4 month trials in 15 markets), a new Epic/Fortnite
promotion (3 month trial in 25 markets), a renewal of our Paypal promotion (3 month trial in 10
markets), and a renewal and expansion of our Vivo promotion (3 month trial in Brazil).
Additionally, we announced a new promotion with TikTok (3 or 4 month trial across 7 countries
in EMEA) which launched in mid July.

Our average monthly Premium churn rate for the quarter was down 23 bps Y/Y and down
modestly Q/Q. The Y/Y improvement continues to be driven by the adoption of our higher
retention offerings like Duo and Family Plans in addition to growth in high retention regions.

FINANCIAL METRICS

Revenue
Revenue of €2,331 million grew 23% Y/Y in Q2 (or 28% Y/Y on a constant currency basis) and
was toward the top end of our guidance range due to significant advertising strength and
subscriber outperformance. FX headwinds of 430 bps were 230 bps greater than expected,
primarily driven by US dollar weakness vs. the Euro. Premium Revenue grew 17% Y/Y to
€2,056 million (or 20% Y/Y constant currency) while Ad-Supported Revenue was particularly
strong, growing 110% Y/Y to €275 million (or 126% Y/Y constant currency).

Within Premium, average revenue per user (“ARPU”) of €4.29 in Q2 was down 3% Y/Y (or flat
Y/Y constant currency vs. down 1% Y/Y in Q1). Excluding the impact of FX, we saw a benefit to
ARPU from our Q1 price increases along with a marginal initial impact from Q2 price increases,
offset by the impact of product mix shift.

Ad-Supported Revenue outperformed our forecast, driven by strong underlying demand
(benefiting sellout and pricing) and aided by favorable comps vs. last year's COVID-19 lows.
The strength in Ad-Supported Revenue was led by our Direct and Podcast sales channels, with
the latter benefiting from a triple-digit Y/Y gain at existing Spotify studios (The Ringer, Parcast,
Spotify Studios, and Gimlet) along with contributions from the Megaphone acquisition, the
exclusive licensing of the Joe Rogan Experience, and Higher Ground. Ad Studio grew 165%
Y/Y due to the success of the video product within Ad Studio and international market
contributions.

We are very pleased with the initial performance of the Spotify Audience Network which
launched in the US in April. The rollout allowed us to increase our monetizable podcast
inventory in the US by nearly 3x. Additionally, for opted-in podcast publishers we’ve seen a
double digit increase in fill rates, a meaningful increase in unique advertisers, and a double digit
lift in CPMs. On July 1, we expanded the Spotify Audience Network to include Australia,
Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Gross Margin
Gross Margin finished at 28.4% in Q2, above the top end of our guidance range and reflecting
308 bps of Y/Y expansion. While we did benefit from the release of accruals for prior period
publishing royalty estimates, excluding the impact of these items, Gross Margin would have
been 26.5%, ahead of our expectations. The Gross Margin improvement excluding these
releases was driven by a favorable revenue mix shift towards podcasts, marketplace activity,
and Other Cost of Revenue efficiencies (e.g. payment fees, streaming delivery costs), which
were partially offset by higher non-music and other content costs and publishing rate increases.

Premium Gross Margin was 30.8% in Q2, up 261 bps Y/Y and Ad-Supported Gross Margin was
11.3% in Q2, up 2,321 bps Y/Y. As a reminder, all content costs related to podcast investment
are included in the Ad-Supported business for the current and historical periods.

Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses totaled €651 million in Q2, an increase of 1% Y/Y (or 5% Y/Y constant
currency) and in line with our plan. Excluding the benefits of currency movements, Operating
Expenses were modestly higher than forecast as lower than expected marketing expenses
arising from campaign timing shifts were offset by higher personnel costs.

Social Charges were approximately €2 million higher than forecast due to an increase in our
share price during the quarter. Excluding the impact of Social Charges in both periods,
Operating Expenses grew roughly in line with revenue. As a reminder, Social Charges are
payroll taxes associated with employee salaries and benefits, including share-based
compensation. We are subject to social taxes in several countries in which we operate, although
Sweden accounts for the bulk of the social costs. We don’t forecast stock price changes in our
guidance so upward or downward movements will impact our reported operating expenses.

At the end of Q2, our workforce consisted of 7,085 FTEs globally.

Product and Platform
During the quarter, we continued to increase the pace of our innovation efforts. On June 16, we
soft-launched Spotify Greenroom, a redesigned version of Betty Lab’s Locker Room app, as
part of our entry into the live audio space. This mobile app allows users to join or host live audio
rooms, and optionally turn those conversations into podcasts. Additionally, we announced a
Creator Fund bringing new exciting content to users and helping those creators get rewarded for
the content they create on the platform. We expect to move to a full commercial launch of
Spotify Greenroom later this year, with an initial focus on sports, pop culture, music, and
entertainment.

During the quarter, we began rolling out our paid subscription platform for podcasters in the US.
Additionally, as part of our Spotify Open Access platform strategy, we announced several new
partnerships aimed at opening our platform to third-party paywalled content with the goal of
becoming the world’s leading audio browser. On May 20, we partnered with Storytel, one of the
world’s leading audiobook streaming services, to give Storytel subscribers the ability to enjoy
their library of audiobooks on Spotify. On July 27, we announced more than 10 new Spotify
Open Access partners -- with more to come -- all of which will be able to activate their
subscriber base on Spotify while retaining full control over their content.

We continue to improve our search capability expanding our functionality to include filters and
voice search making it quicker and more efficient for users to find content. Additionally, we

rolled out a new version of Your Library to all Spotify mobile users that creates a streamlined
way for listeners to explore their collection and find saved music and podcasts more easily.

During the quarter, we also advanced our product ubiquity efforts in a number of key areas. We
introduced a new miniplayer experience that allows listeners to share, explore, and discover
audio from Spotify directly within Facebook, without switching between apps. On the Apple
Watch, we rolled out the capability for users to download playlists, albums, and podcasts to their
watch. Finally, we expanded our video podcast footprint to Xbox gaming consoles and went live
with the Spotify X1 integration to Rogers Communications customers in Canada.

Content
At the end of Q2, we had 2.9 million podcasts on the platform (up from 2.6 million at the end of
Q1). The percentage of MAUs that engaged with podcast content on our platform improved
modestly relative to Q1. Among MAUs that engaged with podcasts in Q2, consumption trends
were strong (up 95% Y/Y in aggregate and more than 30% Y/Y on a per user basis) while week-
over-week and month-over-month retention rates reached all-time highs. During the quarter,
podcast share of overall consumption hours on our platform also reached an all-time high.

During the quarter, we announced exclusive licensing deals with Call Her Daddy and Armchair
Expert, both of which are now exclusively on Spotify. The Joe Rogan Experience continues to
perform above expectations, and The Ringer shows, such as The Bill Simmons Podcast, grew
consumption significantly as the NBA headed into the playoffs.

Internationally, we released 100 new Originals & Exclusives (“O&E”) podcasts across markets
including 5 adaptations of existing formats. We expanded Your Daily Drive to include Mexico
(Ruta Diaria), Argentina (Ruta Diaria), and Brazil (Caminho Diário). The launches included
bespoke content from 28 partners across the region, such as notable new organizations like
Infobae and La Nación (Argentina), W Radio (Mexico), and 123 Segundos (Brazil), a Spotify
original. One of the top podcasts in India, The Ranveer Show, which covers topics like health,
spirituality, and lifestyle, also came exclusively to Spotify in June.

In Q2, Olivia Rodrigo’s album, SOUR, set the record for biggest streaming debut for any album
on Spotify this year with over 63 million global first day streams. Other major releases in the
quarter include BTS single, Butter, Griff’s Album, One Foot In Front Of The Other, and Doja
Cat’s album, Planet Her. Spotify also launched a new Fresh Finds marketing program to
celebrate Indie artists in the US as well as expanding the playlist via localized editions in 13
territories around the world. Fresh Finds, which first launched in 2016, has playlisted over
25,000 artists and built a reputation among users and in the industry as the go-to destination to
discover new Indie acts. In addition, of artists whose first editorial playlist is Fresh Finds, over
44% go on to be playlisted in another editorial property on Spotify.

Two-Sided Marketplace
We continue to test Discovery Mode with a small set of labels and licensors including major
labels, independent labels, and independent artist distributors. Thus far, artists with tracks in
Discovery Mode have found over 40% more listeners on average compared to pre-Discovery
Mode. Additionally, 44% of those listeners had never listened to the artist before. We are
integrating feedback from our early partners with a broader rollout of Discovery Mode expected
later this year with the main goal of facilitating more artist to fan connections.

Sponsored Recommendations (i.e. Marquee) continued to gain traction during the second
quarter as we expanded into more international markets including Australia, Ireland, New
Zealand, and the UK. We also rolled out new functionality for artist teams using the self-serve
platform to target specific audience segments (casual listeners, lapsed listeners, and recently
interested listeners) with their campaigns, a functionality previously only available to customers
purchasing through our sales team.

Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow was €34 million in Q2, a €7 million increase Y/Y primarily due to an increase in
net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by higher working capital needs arising
from select licensor payments (delayed from Q1), podcast-related payments, and higher ad-
receivables. Capital expenditures increased €6 million Y/Y largely due to office build outs in LA,
Berlin, and Miami.

At the end of Q2, we maintained a strong liquidity position with €3.1 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures:
 Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue
excluding foreign exchange effect, Gross margin excluding release of accruals for prior period publishing royalty estimate,
Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding social charge, and Free Cash Flow.
Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect,
Gross margin excluding release of accruals for prior period publishing royalty estimate, Operating expense excluding foreign
exchange effect, Operating expense excluding social charge are useful to investors because they present measures that
facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue

Ad-Supported revenue, Gross margin, Operating expense or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount
of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude
certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance
