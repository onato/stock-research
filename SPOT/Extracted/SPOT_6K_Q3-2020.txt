Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)

1.       Corporate information

            Spotify Technology S.A. (the "Company" or "parent") is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company's
registered office is 42-44 avenue de la Gare, L-1610, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

             The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Group," "we," "us," or "our") is audio streaming. The Group's premium service
("Premium Service") provides users with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts. The Premium Service
offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks. The Group's ad-supported service ("Ad-Supported Service," and together with the Premium
Service, the "Service") has no subscription fees and provides users with limited on-demand online access to the catalog of music and unlimited online access to the
catalog of podcasts. The Group depends on securing content licenses from a number of major and minor content owners and other rights holders in order to provide
its service.

2.       Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies

              The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Spotify Technology S.A. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and
2019 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The interim financial information is unaudited. The interim financial information
reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, as they
do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the
results for a full year. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Euros.

New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group

             The IASB has issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether or not an
acquired set of activities and assets is a business. It has also issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies to
align the definition of "material" across the standards and to clarify certain aspects of the definition. The Group has adopted these amendments as of January 1,
2020. There was no impact on the Group's accounting policies or the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. There are no other IFRS or IFRIC
interpretations effective as of January 1, 2020 that are expected to have a material impact.

3.       Critical accounting estimates and judgments

           In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Group's
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

            Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events.

4.       Business combinations

Bill Simmons Media Group, LLC

            On March 6, 2020, the Group acquired 100% of Bill Simmons Media Group, LLC ("The Ringer"), a leading creator of sports, entertainment, and pop
culture content. The acquisition allows the Group to expand its content offering, audience reach, and podcast monetization.

            The fair value of the purchase consideration was €170 million, comprising €138 million in cash paid at closing and a liability of €32 million, being the
present value of payments of €44 million over five years. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Of the total purchase consideration,
€140 million has been recorded to goodwill, €26 million to acquired intangible assets, €1 million to cash and cash equivalents, and €3 million to other tangible net
assets. The Group incurred €3 million in acquisition related costs, which were recognized as general and administrative expenses.



                                                                                -7-

            The goodwill represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate
recognition, including an increase in content development capabilities, an experienced workforce, and expected future synergies. The goodwill recognized is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was included in the Ad-Supported segment.

             The intangible assets, which consist of trade names, were valued by the Group using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The
relief from royalty method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the trade names. The assets have useful lives ranging from five
to eight years.

           In addition to the purchase consideration there are cash payments of €47 million that are contingent on the continued employment of certain Ringer
employees. In addition, €12 million of equity instruments were offered to and accepted by certain Ringer employees, which have vesting conditions contingent on
continued employment and are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. These cash payments and share-based payment transactions are
recognized as post-combination expense over employment service periods of up to five years, if not forfeited by the employees.

            For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue and operating results of The Ringer were not significant to the Group's condensed
consolidated statement of operations.

5.       Segment information

             The Group has two reportable segments: Premium and Ad-Supported. The Premium Service is a paid service in which customers can listen on-demand
and offline. Revenue for the Premium segment is generated through subscription fees. The Ad-Supported Service is free to the user. Revenue for the Ad-Supported
segment is primarily generated through the sale of advertising across the Group's music and podcast content. Royalty costs are primarily recorded in each segment
based on specific rates for each segment agreed to with rights holders. Effective January 1, 2020, all podcast content costs are recorded in the Ad-Supported
segment. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior year in order to conform to the current year's presentation. The remaining costs that are
not specifically associated to either of the segments are allocated based on user activity or the revenue recognized in each segment. The operations of businesses
acquired during 2019 and 2020 are included in the Ad-Supported segment. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.

            Key financial performance measures of the segments including revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit/(loss) are as follows:
                                                                                    Three months ended September 30,               Nine months ended September 30,
                                                                                       2020                  2019                      2020                2019

Reconciliation of gross profit

             Operating expenses, finance income, and finance costs are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an overall group basis. The
reconciliation between reportable segment gross profit to the Group's loss before tax is as follows:


                                                                                     Three months ended September 30,             Nine months ended September 30,

7.       Income tax

             The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were 13.3% and 10.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were 13.9% and 45.6%, respectively. Drivers of the Group's effective tax rate include the tax impact of share-
based payments, discrete benefits due to fair value gains, and unrecognized tax losses in certain jurisdictions. The Group operates in a global environment with
significant operations in various jurisdictions outside Luxembourg. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the Group's
earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions where the Group operates.

            For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the income tax benefit of €15 million and €74 million, respectively, was due primarily to the
recognition of deferred taxes as a result of the unrealized increase in the fair value of the Group's long term investment in Tencent Music Entertainment Group
("TME"). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the income tax expense of €29 million and €19 million, respectively, was due primarily to a
decrease in the recognition of deferred taxes as a result of the unrealized decrease in the fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME and the current
impact of stock option exercises.

              Gross tax provisions were €2 million and €1 million as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Interest and penalties included in
income tax (benefit)/expense were not material in any of the periods presented. Transactions recorded through other comprehensive income have been shown net
of their tax impact, as applicable, based on currently enacted tax laws.

            Net deferred tax assets of €12 million and €7 million have been recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In evaluating the probability of realizing the deferred tax assets, the Group considered all available
positive and negative evidence of future tax profit, including past operating results and the forecast of market growth and earnings. As of September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, deferred tax assets of €500 million and €379 million have not been recognized.

8.       (Loss)/earnings per share

             Basic (loss)/earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares during the period. Diluted
(loss)/earnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method to the extent that the effect is dilutive by using the weighted-average number of outstanding
ordinary shares and potential outstanding ordinary shares during the period. The Group's potential ordinary shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the
assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, and the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock units, restricted stock
awards, and other contingently issuable shares, excluding all anti-dilutive ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The computation of (loss)/earnings per
share for the respective periods is as follows:




                                                                               - 10 -

transactions and are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of each equity
instrument granted to certain employees of Anchor and The Ringer was US$145.21 and US$145.14, respectively.

first vesting period of three or eight months from date of grant and vest monthly or annually thereafter until fully vested four years from date of grant.

           In the table above, the number of RSUs released include ordinary shares that the Group has withheld for settlement of employees' tax obligations due
upon the vesting of RSUs.

             During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company implemented a new Employee Stock Option Plan and Director Stock Option Plan
(together, the "2020 Stock Option Plans"), under which stock options of the Company are granted to executives and employees of the Group and to members of the
Company's Board of Directors. For options granted under the 2020 Stock Option Plans, the exercise price is equal to the fair value of the ordinary shares on grant
date or equal to 150% of the fair value of the ordinary shares on the grant date. The exercise price is included in the grant date fair value of the award. The options
granted to participants under the 2020 Stock Option Plans have a first vesting period of three or eight months from date of grant and vest monthly or annually
thereafter until fully vested. The options are granted with a term of five years.

              Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. The results of such legal proceedings are
difficult to predict and the extent of the Group's financial exposure is difficult to estimate. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both
probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

19.      Financial instruments

Foreign exchange forward contracts

Cash flow hedges

            The Group's currency pairs used for cash flow hedges are Euro / U.S. dollar, Euro / Australian dollar, Euro / British pound, Euro / Swedish krona, Euro
/ Canadian dollar, and Euro / Norwegian krone. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts hedging the revenue and cost of revenue line items in the
condensed consolidated statement of operations was approximately €935 million and €677 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and approximately
€888 million and €650 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.

Fair values

            The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, restricted cash, trade and other
payables, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. All other financial assets and liabilities are
accounted for at fair value.

            The following tables summarize, by major security type, the Group's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis,
and the category using the fair value hierarchy:

             The impact on the fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME with a decrease or increase of TME's share price used to value the Group's
equity interests of 10% results in a range of €1,604 million to €1,961 million at September 30, 2020.

           The following sections describe the valuation methodologies the Group uses to measure its Level 3 financial instruments at fair value on a recurring
basis.

Warrants

             On July 13, 2020, the Company issued 1,084,043 ordinary shares and 10,840,430 beneficiary certificates to Daniel Ek, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, through D.G.E. Investments Limited, an entity indirectly wholly owned by him, upon the effective net settlement of the 1,600,000 warrants that were
granted on July 13, 2017.

           As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the number of outstanding warrants was 800,000 and 2,400,000, respectively.

            The outstanding warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the warrants in the
option pricing model are as follows:
                                                                                                                                             September 30, 2020

            The impact on the fair value of the outstanding warrants with a decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price of 10% results in a range of
€41 million to €65 million at September 30, 2020.

Contingent consideration
             On April 1, 2019, the Group acquired Cutler Media, LLC ("Parcast"), a premier storytelling podcast studio. Included in the purchase price was €13
million related to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration is valued by the Group using a simulation of user engagement
outcomes. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized within general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated
statement of operations.

            The table below presents the changes in the contingent consideration liability:

            As of September 30, 2020, the remaining maximum potential contingent consideration payout is €34 million over the next two years.

20.   Commitments and contingencies

Contingencies
             Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. These may include, but are not limited
to, matters arising out of alleged infringement of intellectual property; alleged violations of consumer regulations; employment-related matters; and disputes
arising out of supplier and other contractual relationships. As a general matter, the music and other content made available on the Group's service are licensed to
the Group by various third



                                                                                - 21 -

parties. Many of these licenses allow rights holders to audit the Group's royalty payments, and any such audit could result in disputes over whether the Group has
paid the proper royalties. If such a dispute were to occur, the Group could be required to pay additional royalties, and the amounts involved could be material. The
Group expenses legal fees as incurred. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Group's operations or
its financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

             On February 25, 2019, Warner/Chappell Music Limited ("WCM") filed a lawsuit against the Group in the High Court of Bombay, India, alleging that
the Group sought to exploit WCM's copyrights in musical compositions in India without obtaining a license. On January 13, 2020, WCM and the Group resolved
the dispute, and on January 14, 2020, the High Court of Bombay, India, disposed of the lawsuit. On April 22, 2019, Saregama India Limited ("Saregama") filed a
lawsuit against us in the High Court of Delhi, India, alleging copyright infringement, and has sought injunctive relief. Saregama and the Group resolved the dispute
via an agreement dated March 30, 2020.

            As of April 2019, the Group's settlement of the Ferrick et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 1:16-cv-8412-AJN (S.D.N.Y.), putative class action lawsuit,
which alleged that the Group unlawfully reproduced and distributed musical compositions without obtaining licenses, was final and effective. Even with the
effectiveness of the settlement, we may still be subject to claims of copyright infringement by rights holders who have purported to opt out of the settlement or who
may not otherwise be covered by its terms. The Music Modernization Act of 2018 contains a limitation of liability with respect to such lawsuits filed on or after
January 1, 2018. Rights holders may, nevertheless, file lawsuits, and may argue that they should not be bound by this limitation of liability. For example, in August
2019, the Eight Mile Style, LLC et al v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 3:19-cv-00736-AAT, lawsuit was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee, alleging both that the Group does not qualify for the limitation of liability in the Music Modernization Act and that the limitation of liability is
unconstitutional and, thus, not valid law. The Group intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit, including plaintiffs' challenges to the limitation of liability in the
Music Modernization Act.

             On August 11, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion which, as of the issuance of the formal “mandate” on
October 26, 2020, vacated the Copyright Royalty Board’s determination of the royalty rates for applicable mechanical rights in the United States for calendar years
2018 to 2022. These rates apply both to compositions that we license under compulsory license in Section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976 and to a number of
direct licenses that we have with music publishers. Until the rates are determined, our recorded royalty costs both retrospectively and prospectively will be based
on management estimates of the rates that will apply. When the rates are determined anew, these could either benefit or adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition.


21.   Related Parties

             On July 13, 2020, the Company issued 1,084,043 ordinary shares and 10,840,430 beneficiary certificates to Daniel Ek, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, through D.G.E. Investments Limited, an entity indirectly wholly owned by him, upon the effective net settlement of the 1,600,000 warrants that were
granted on July 13, 2017.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

             This discussion and analysis reflects our historical results of operations and financial position and contains estimates and forward-looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The words "may," "might," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect,"
"plan," "anticipate," "intend," "seek," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "contemplate," "possible," and similar words are intended to identify
estimates and forward-looking statements.

             Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or
may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they
are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important factors may adversely affect our
results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to:

         •          our ability to attract prospective users and to retain existing users;
         •          competition for users and user listening time;
         •          our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream;
         •          our lack of control over the providers of our content and their effect on our access to music and other content;
         •          our ability to comply with the many complex license agreements to which we are a party;
         •          our ability to accurately estimate the amounts payable under our license agreements;
         •          the limitations on our operating flexibility due to the minimum guarantees required under certain of our license agreements;
         •          our ability to obtain accurate and comprehensive information about music compositions in order to obtain necessary licenses or perform
                    obligations under our existing license agreements;
         •          new copyright legislation that may increase the cost and/or difficulty of music licensing;
         •          risks associated with our international expansion, including difficulties obtaining rights to stream content on favorable terms;
         •          our ability to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis;
         •          our ability to expand our operations to deliver content beyond music, including podcasts;
         •          potential breaches of our security systems;
         •          assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights;
         •          our ability to accurately estimate our user metrics and other estimates;
         •          risks associated with manipulation of stream counts and user accounts and unauthorized access to our services;
         •          changes in legislation or governmental regulations affecting us;
         •          risks relating to privacy and protection of user data;
         •          our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand;
         •          ability to hire and retain key personnel;
         •          risks relating to the acquisition, investment, and disposition of companies or technologies;
         •          tax-related risks;
         •          the concentration of voting power among our founders who have, and will continue to have, substantial control over our business;
         •          risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer;
         •          international, national or local economic, social or political conditions;
         •          risks associated with accounting estimates, currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls; and
         •          the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including any adverse impact on advertising revenue or subscriber
                    acquisition and retention.

             We operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to
predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor are we able to assess the impact of all of these risk factors on our business or the extent to which any risk factor, or
combination of risk factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

             We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed under

Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019 ("Annual Report on Form 20-F"), and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC").

            You should read this discussion and analysis completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from our
expectations.

            Investors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our Investors website (investors.spotify.com),
SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and webcasts. We use these channels, as well as social media, to communicate with our users and the public
about our company, our services, and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on these channels could be deemed to be material information.
Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the channels listed on our Investors
website.

Overview

            Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the
opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.

            We are the most popular global audio streaming subscription service. We currently have a presence in 92 countries and territories and growing,
including our latest expansion into 13 countries in Europe in July 2020. Our platform includes 320 million monthly active users ("MAUs") and 144 million
Premium Subscribers (as defined below) as of September 30, 2020.

          Our users are highly engaged. We currently monetize our Service through both subscriptions and advertising. Our Premium Subscribers have grown
27% year-over-year, as of September 30, 2020, to 144 million. Our 320 million MAUs have grown 29% year-over-year, as of September 30, 2020.

            Our results reflect the effects of our bi-annual trial programs, both discounted and free trials, in addition to seasonal trends in user behavior and, with
respect to our Ad-Supported segment, advertising behavior. Historically, Premium Subscriber growth accelerates when we run bi-annual trial programs in the
summer and winter, which typically begin in the middle of the second and fourth quarters. Historically, discounted trial programs have led to decreases in gross
margin in the first and third quarter of each year as discounted trial costs are included in costs of revenue, while the costs of providing free trials are included in
sales and marketing expense and do not impact gross margin. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we offered relatively more free trials compared to
discounted trials than during comparable periods in prior years, and, as a result, there is less impact on gross margin.

            For our Ad-Supported segment, typically we experience higher advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater
advertising demand during the holiday season. However, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we typically experience a seasonal decline in advertising
revenue due to reduced advertiser demand.

Acquisition

             On March 6, 2020, we acquired Bill Simmons Media Group, LLC ("The Ringer"), a leading creator of sports, entertainment, and pop culture content,
for a total purchase consideration of €170 million. The acquisition allows us to expand our content offering, audience reach, and podcast monetization.

Podcast licensing

             During the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a multi-year exclusive licensing deal with The Joe Rogan Experience, which debuted on Spotify in
September 2020 and will become exclusive on the platform in December 2020. We continue to enter into license agreements with producers, publishers, and
creators to enhance our podcast content offerings.

Key Performance Indicators

             We use certain key performance indicators to monitor and manage our business. We use these indicators to evaluate our business, measure our
performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe these indicators provide useful information
to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner we do.

MAUs
             We track MAUs as an indicator of the size of the audience engaged with our Service. We define MAUs as the total count of users of our Ad-Supported
Service ("Ad-Supported Users") and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end
indicated. Reported MAUs may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Service within a thirty-day period as one individual may register
for, and use, multiple accounts. Additionally, fraud and unauthorized access to our Service may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of MAUs, if
undetected. Fraudulent accounts typically are created by bots to inflate content licensing payments to individual rights holders. We strive to detect and minimize
these fraudulent accounts. Our MAUs in the tables below are inclusive of users that may have employed methods to limit or otherwise avoid being served
advertisements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed under Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual
Report on Form 20-F, and in our other filings with the SEC.

            The table below sets forth our monthly active users as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.
                                                                                           As of September 30

            MAUs were 320 million as of September 30, 2020 and 248 million as of September 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 29%. MAUs benefited
from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Service, both through geographic expansion and consumer marketing. MAUs also benefited from
continued investment in content and features on our platform, including featured playlists, artist marketing campaigns, podcasts, and original content, to drive
increased user engagement and customer satisfaction.


Premium Subscribers
              We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for Premium Service. Our
Premium Subscribers include all registered accounts in our Family Plan and Duo Plan. Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five additional
sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan Subscription. Our Duo Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to one additional
sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan Subscription. Premium Subscribers includes subscribers in a grace period of up to 30 days
after failing to pay their subscription fee.

            The table below sets forth our Premium Subscribers as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.
                                                                                               As of September 30

             Premium Subscribers were 144 million as of September 30, 2020 and 113 million as of September 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 27%.
The Family Plan was a meaningful contributor of total gross added Premium Subscribers, while our free trial offers and global campaigns also accounted for a
significant portion of gross added Premium Subscribers. In addition, there was an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers on our Duo Plan.

Ad-Supported MAUs
             We define Ad-Supported MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last
thirty days from the period-end indicated.

           Ad-Supported MAUs were 185 million as of September 30, 2020 and 141 million as of September 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 31%.
Ad-Supported MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Ad-Supported Service, both through geographic expansion and
consumer marketing. Ad-Supported MAUs also benefited from continued investment in content and features on our platform, including featured playlists, artist
marketing campaigns, podcasts, and original content, to drive increased Ad-Supported User engagement and customer satisfaction.

Premium ARPU
             Premium average revenue per user ("ARPU") is a monthly measure defined as Premium revenue recognized in the quarter indicated divided by the
average daily Premium Subscribers in such quarter, which is then divided by three months. Fiscal year-to-date figures are calculated by averaging Premium ARPU
for the quarters in such period.

            The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

                                          Three months ended September 30,                               Nine months ended September 30,

           For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Premium ARPU was €4.19 and €4.67, respectively, which represented a decrease of 10%.
The decrease was due principally to a change in Premium Subscriber mix, reducing Premium ARPU by €0.30, and movements in foreign exchange rates, reducing
Premium ARPU by €0.19.

           For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Premium ARPU was €4.33 and €4.75, respectively, which represented a decrease of 9%. The
decrease was due principally to a change in Premium Subscriber mix, reducing Premium ARPU by €0.29, and movements in foreign exchange rates, reducing
Premium ARPU by €0.09.

How We Generate Revenue

            We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments - Premium and Ad-Supported. We identify our reportable segments based on the
organizational units used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 5 to our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments.

Premium
            We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of the Premium Service. The Premium Service is sold directly to end users and
through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone
subscriptions from the end user. We also bundle the Premium Service with third-party services and products.

Ad-Supported
             We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising impressions
across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on our platform on behalf of the
agencies' clients. Additionally, the Group generates Ad-Supported revenue through arrangements with certain advertising exchange platforms to distribute
advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis through their automated exchange.

Components of our Operating Results
             Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming. We incur royalty costs, which
we pay to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders, for the right to stream music to our users. Royalties are typically calculated monthly
based on the combination of a number of different elements. Generally, Premium Service royalties are based on the greater of a percentage of revenue and a per
user amount. Royalties for the Ad-Supported Service are typically a percentage of revenue, although certain agreements are based on the greater of a percentage of
revenue and an amount for each time a sound recording and musical composition are streamed. We have negotiated lower per user amounts for our lower priced
subscription plans such as Family Plan and Student Plan users. In our agreements with certain record labels, the percentage of revenue used in the calculation of
royalties is dependent upon certain targets being met. The targets can include such measures as the number of Premium Subscribers, the ratio of Ad-



                                                                                 - 26 -
Table of Contents



Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, and/or the rates of Premium Subscriber churn. With minor exceptions, we are effectively currently meeting the targets
and, consequently, we are generally paying the lowest percentage of revenue possible per the agreements. In addition, royalty rates vary by country. Some of our
royalty agreements require that royalty costs be paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. For the majority of royalty agreements
incremental costs incurred due to un-recouped advances and minimum guarantees have not been significant to date. We also have certain so-called most favored
nation royalty agreements, which require us to record additional costs if certain material contract terms are not as favorable as the terms we have agreed to with
similar licensors.

             Cost of revenue also includes credit card and payment processing fees for subscription revenue, customer service, certain employee compensation and
benefits, cloud computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs, as well as amounts incurred to produce podcasts and other content. Direct costs incurred to
acquire or develop podcasts are recognized as current assets. Cost of revenue includes the consumption of these assets over their useful economic life, which starts
at the release of each episode. In most cases, consumption is on an accelerated basis.

             Additionally, cost of revenue has historically included discounted trial costs related to our bi-annual trial programs. While we believe our discounted
trial programs help drive incremental revenue and gross margins as users convert to full-time Premium Subscribers, these discounted trial programs, which
historically have typically begun in the middle of the second and fourth quarters of each year, have led to decreases in gross margins in the first and third calendar
quarters as we absorb the promotional expenses of the discounted trial offers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we offered relatively more free trials
compared to discounted trials than during comparable periods in prior years, and, as a result, there is less impact on gross margin.

             Research and Development. We invest heavily in research and development in order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction on our
platform, which we believe helps drive organic growth in new MAUs, which, in turn, drives additional growth in, and better retention of, Premium Subscribers, as
well as increased advertising opportunities to Ad-Supported Users. We aim to design products and features that create and enhance user experiences, and new
technologies are at the core of many of these opportunities. Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for development of products related to our platform and
Service, as well as new advertising products and improvements to our mobile application and desktop application and streaming services. The costs incurred
include related facility costs, consulting costs, and employee compensation and benefits costs. We expect engineers to represent a significant portion of our
employees over the foreseeable future.

              Many of our new products and improvements to our platform require large investments and involve substantial time and risks to develop and launch.
Some of these products may not be well received or may take a long time for users to adopt. As a result, the benefits of our research and development investments
are difficult to forecast.

             Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, public relations, branding, consulting
expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, live events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with music record
labels, publishers, songwriters, and artists to promote the availability of new releases on our platform, and the costs of providing free trials of Premium Services.
Expenses included in the cost of providing free trials are derived primarily from per user royalty fees determined in accordance with the rights holder agreements.

             General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits for functions such as
finance, accounting, analytics, legal, human resources, consulting fees, and other costs including facility and equipment costs, officers' liability insurance, director
fees, and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration.

Results of Operations

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic
             The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
taken a number of actions focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, maintaining business continuity, and supporting the global music
community, including extending the work-from-home arrangement for all employees that began in March until June 30, 2021, slowing the pace of hiring for the
remainder of 2020, and launching the Spotify COVID-19 Music Relief Project, through which we match donations to organizations that offer financial relief to
those in the music community most in need around the world up to a total contribution of $10 million.




                                                                                 - 27 -

             Although during the third quarter of 2020, we have started to see some return to pre-COVID-19 levels in our users’ engagement with our Service, the
full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not
be able to accurately predict and that will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any resurgences, the impact of the pandemic
on economic activity, and actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response. For example, although our Ad-Supported revenue returned to
growth during the third quarter of 2020, we have continued to face headwinds to our advertising business. Refer to Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this
document for further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Premium revenue
            For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Premium revenue comprised 91% and 90% of our total revenue, respectively. For the three
months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, Premium revenue increased €229 million, or 15%. The increase
was attributable primarily to a 27% growth in the number of Premium Subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in Premium ARPU of 10%, as noted above.

             For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Premium revenue comprised 92% and 91% of our total revenue, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Premium revenue increased €800 million, or 18%. The increase was
attributable primarily to a 27% increase in the number of Premium Subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in Premium ARPU of 9%, as noted above. The nine
months ended September 30, 2020 reflected a change in prior period estimates that reduced revenue by €14 million.

Ad-Supported revenue
           For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 9% and 10% of our total revenue, respectively. For the
three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, Ad-Supported revenue increased €15 million, or 9%. This
increase was due primarily to a 6% increase in the number of impressions sold, driven largely by our podcast and self-serve channels.

            For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 8% and 9% of our total revenue, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Ad-Supported revenue increased €3 million, or 1%. This increase
was due primarily to an increase in revenue from our self-serve channel and podcasts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our
direct channel, driven by a decrease in the average rate per impression as a result of reduced advertising demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Foreign exchange impact on total revenue
            The general strengthening of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar and Brazilian Real for the three months ended
September 30, 2020, and the Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, and Mexican Peso for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in
2019, had an unfavorable net impact on our revenue. We estimate that total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 would have been
approximately €89 million and €112 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable
periods in 2019.

Premium cost of revenue
              For the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, Premium cost of revenue increased €160
million, or 14%, and Premium cost of revenue as a percentage of Premium revenue remained flat at 73%. The increase in Premium cost of revenue was driven
primarily by growth in new Premium Subscribers resulting in higher royalty costs, streaming delivery costs, and payment transaction fees of €156 million, €7
million, and €4 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in discounted trial costs of €13 million as we had relatively more users on
free trials compared to discounted trials year-over-year.

             For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Premium cost of revenue increased €530
million, or 16%, and Premium cost of revenue as a percentage of Premium revenue decreased from 73% to 72%. The increase in Premium cost of revenue was
driven primarily by an increase in new Premium Subscribers resulting in higher royalty costs, payment transaction fees, and streaming delivery costs of €540
million, €17 million, and €16 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in discounted trial costs of €34 million as we had relatively more users on free
trials compared to discounted trials year-over-year. The nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a net €7 million benefit relating to settlements with rights
holders and changes in prior period estimates for rights holder liabilities. The nine months ended September 30, 2019 included charges related to disputes with
certain rights holders of €8 million.

Ad-Supported cost of revenue
            For the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, Ad-Supported cost of revenue increased
€36 million, or 24%, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue increased from 87% to 99%. The increase in Ad-Supported cost
of revenue was driven primarily by growth in both advertising revenue and streams, resulting in higher royalty costs of €15 million, and an increase in podcast
costs and delivery costs of €15 million and €5 million, respectively.

             For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Ad-Supported cost of revenue increased
€81 million, or 20%, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue increased from 88% to 105%. The increase in Ad-Supported cost
of revenue was driven primarily by an increase in podcast costs of €40 million, growth in streams resulting in higher royalty costs of €20 million, and delivery
costs of €14 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a charge of €5 million relating to changes in prior period estimates for rights holder
liabilities.

Foreign exchange impact on total cost of revenue
            The general strengthening of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar and Brazilian Real for the three months ended
September 30, 2020, and the Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, and Mexican Peso for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in
2019, had a favorable net impact on our cost of revenue. We estimate that total cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 would
have been approximately €69 million and €88 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the
comparable periods in 2019.

            For the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, finance costs increased €80 million. The
increase was due primarily to an increase of €48 million in foreign exchange losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in a transaction
currency other than the functional currency. There was also an increase in fair value losses recorded for warrants of €27 million.

            For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, finance costs increased €166 million. The
increase was due primarily to an increase in fair value losses recorded for warrants of €93 million. There was also an increase of €66 million in foreign exchange
losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in a transaction currency other than the functional currency.

             For the three months ended September 30, 2020, income tax benefit was €15 million, compared to an income tax expense of €29 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2019. This change of €44 million is due primarily to an increase in the recognition of deferred tax assets as a result of the increase in
the fair value of our long term investment in TME.

million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. This change of €342 million is due primarily to an increase in operating loss and finance costs, and a
decrease in finance income, partially offset by an increase in income tax benefit.

Non-IFRS Financial Measure
           We have reported our financial results in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB. In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-IFRS
measure of Free Cash Flow as discussed below.

            We define "Free Cash Flow" as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in restricted cash. We believe Free Cash
Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Free Cash Flow is
not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities.

            Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance. Because Free Cash
Flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. You should not consider Free Cash Flow in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported on our
interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document.

            Set forth below is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.

                                                                                                                                       Nine months ended September 30,

Liquidity and Capital Resources

             Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operating activities. Cash and
cash equivalents and short term investments consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in government
securities, corporate debt securities, and collateralized reverse




                                                                                   - 33 -

purchase agreements. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by €144 million from €1,757 million as of December 31, 2019 to €1,901
million as of September 30, 2020.

              We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and the cash flow we generate from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working
capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements may be materially different than those currently
planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on content
and research and development, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, our
continued international expansion, competitive factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future
sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale
of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders, while the incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations. Such
debt instruments also could introduce covenants that might restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable
terms, or at all. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and
volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the
future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position are critical at this time of
uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and allow us to use our cash resources for working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements,
contractual obligations, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. For additional information, refer to the risk factors
discussed under Part II - Other Information, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" below and in our other filings with the SEC.

           We have planned capital expenditures of approximately €123 million in the next 12 months associated with the build-out of office space in Los
Angeles, New York, Miami, Berlin, and Singapore, among others.

          While we continue to make investments in offices and information technology infrastructure through purchases of property and equipment and lease
arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our business, we may slow the pace of our investments due to COVID-19.

Operating activities
            Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by €218 million to €152 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in operating loss of €228 million, partially offset by non-cash items
including depreciation, amortization, and share-based payments expense. In addition, there was an increase in interest payments on lease liabilities of €18 million.

Investing activities
             Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €127 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an increase in purchases of short term investments of €278 million and a decrease in sales and
maturities in short term investments of €82 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash used in business combinations, net of cash acquired, of €194 million, and
a decrease in capital expenditures of €60 million.

Financing activities
           Net cash flows from financing activities increased by €564 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of €191 million. The nine months ended
September 30, 2019 included €408 million in repurchases of ordinary shares, with no material repurchases occurring during the nine months ended September 30,
2020.

Free Cash Flow
            Free Cash Flow decreased by €162 million to €109 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, due primarily to the decrease in net cash flows from operating activities of €218 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures
of €60 million.

Restrictions on Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds
             The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Company by the Company's direct subsidiaries and such
payments by its indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are subject to various restrictions. Future indebtedness of these subsidiaries may prohibit the
payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Company. In addition, the ability of any of the Company's direct or indirect
subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including
financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, liquidity requirements, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution, and
other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. Spotify AB, which, directly or indirectly through its
subsidiaries, conducts much of the Group's business, may only make dividends to the Company if there would continue to be full coverage of its restricted equity
following such dividend, and only if doing so would be considered prudent under Swedish law given the needs of Spotify AB and its subsidiaries. Loans and other
advances from Spotify AB to the Company may be subject to essentially the same restrictions as dividends. Since the Company is expected to rely primarily on
dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries to fund its financial and other obligations, restrictions on its ability to receive such funds may adversely impact
the Company's ability to fund its financial and other obligations.

Indebtedness
             As of September 30, 2020, we have no material outstanding indebtedness, other than lease liabilities. We may from time to time seek to incur
additional indebtedness. Such indebtedness, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other
factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

            As of September 30, 2020, we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special
purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to
material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity,
market risk, or credit risk support to us.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

            Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks. Our primary market risk exposures relate to currency, interest rate, share price, and investment
risks. To manage these risks and our exposure to the unpredictability of financial markets, we seek to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial
performance and capital.

             Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and share
prices, both our own and those used to value certain of our long-term investments. Refer to Part II Item IA. "Risk Factors" in this document for further discussion
on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Currency Risk

            Currency risk manifests itself in transaction exposure, which relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by operations
(purchasing and selling) and/or financing (interest and amortization). The volatility in foreign exchange rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular a
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro may negatively affect our revenue. Our general policy is to hedge transaction exposure on a case-by-case
basis. Translation exposure relates to net investments in foreign operations. We do not conduct translation risk hedging.

            The Group is subject to deferred tax as a result of foreign exchange movements between USD, EUR, and SEK, primarily related to its investment in
TME.

Transaction Exposure Sensitivity

              In most cases, our customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental fees are settled
in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily settled in Euros and U.S. dollars. Hence, the operational need to net purchase foreign currency is due primarily
to a deficit from such settlements.

             The table below shows the immediate impact on loss before tax of a 10% strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro in the closing
exchange rate of significant currencies to which we have transaction exposure, at September 30, 2020. The sensitivity associated with a 10% weakening of a
particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.



                                                                                            - 36 -

Translation Exposure Sensitivity

            The impact on our equity would be approximately €43 million if the Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on the
exposure at September 30, 2020.

Interest Rate Risk

             Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on earnings and cash flow. Our exposure to interest rate risk is
related to our interest-bearing assets, primarily our short term debt securities. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield of the investment. The sensitivity
analysis considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a change of 100 basis points could be
experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have impacted interest income by €2 million and €5 million for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

Share Price Risk

          Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the
Company's ordinary share price. Our exposure to this risk relates primarily to the outstanding warrants.

            The impact on the fair value of the outstanding warrants with a decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price of 10% results in a range of
€41 million to €65 million at September 30, 2020.

          The impact on the accrual for social costs on outstanding share-based payment awards of a decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price
of 10% would both result in a change of €18 million at September 30, 2020.

Investment Risk

            We are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our long term investments, due primarily to volatility in the share
price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of our long term investments relate to TME. The impact on the fair value of the Group's
long term investment in TME with a decrease or increase of TME's share price used to value the Group's equity interests of 10% results in a range of €1,604
million to €1,961 million at September 30, 2020.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
            We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Preparing these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

            We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue, share-based payments, content, warrants, business combinations, determining
the incremental borrowing rate, and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we
consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.

            There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates
described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

             See Note 2 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this document for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, if material, as of the dates of the statement of financial position included in this document.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

             We are from time to time subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings
involve highly complex issues, and often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, our potential liability with respect to a large portion of
such claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty. Management, with the assistance of legal counsel, periodically reviews the
status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when it determines that an
unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or
actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. If management's estimates prove incorrect, current reserves could be inadequate and we could incur a
charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, net worth, and cash flows.

            For a discussion of legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 20 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

            Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F includes a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates,
and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 20-F. Except as presented below, there have been
no material changes to our risk factors since those reported in Annual Report on Form 20-F.

            The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

              The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic
will continue to impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately
predict and that will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, and actions taken by
governments, businesses, and individuals in response. The economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to
adversely affect, the levels of advertising spending and consumer spending on discretionary items, which in turn adversely affect our ad sales and Subscriber
acquisition and retention. Limitations on travel, "stay at home" orders, social distancing requirements, and other governmental actions implemented in response to
COVID-19 led to changes as to how our users consume music and podcasts, and, although we have started to see some return to pre-COVID-19 levels in our users’
engagement with our Service, any failure to predict or address such changes in our users' engagement with our Service arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,
could adversely affect our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, podcasters and other creators or users may experience delays or interruptions in their
ability to create and provide content on our platform, and a decrease in the amount or quality of content available on our Service could adversely affect user
engagement and harm our business. An extended period of remote working by our employees could introduce or heighten operational challenges, including our
ability to launch new products and services or expand our Service to additional geographic markets. Any such effect could cause or contribute to the risks and
uncertainties enumerated in our Annual Report on Form 20-F and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

          Interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our own systems or from third parties could impair the delivery of our Service and
harm our business.

             We rely on systems housed in our own facilities and upon third parties, including bandwidth providers and third-party "cloud" data storage services, to
enable our users to receive our content in a dependable, timely, and efficient manner. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, periodic service
interruptions and delays involving our own systems and those of third parties that we work with. Both our own facilities and those of third parties are vulnerable to
damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage,
intentional acts of vandalism, the failure of physical, administrative, technical, and cyber security measures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, human error, the
financial insolvency of third parties that we work with, global pandemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other unanticipated
problems or events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our Service and unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and
data contained in our systems that these third parties store and deliver on our behalf.




                                                                                 - 38 -
Table of Contents



            Any disruption in the services provided by these third parties could materially adversely impact our business reputation, customer relations, and
operating results. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third parties, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely
manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one third party to another could subject us to
operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.

(1)   On November 5, 2018, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. Repurchases of up
      to 10,000,000 of the Company's ordinary shares were authorized at the Company's general meeting of shareholders on April 21, 2016. The repurchase program will expire on April 21,
      2021. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment
      opportunities. The repurchase program will be executed consistent with the Company's capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to grow the business over the long term.
(2)   On July 10, 2020, the Company issued 2,026,000 ordinary shares to our Netherlands subsidiary at par value and subsequently repurchased those shares at the same price. These shares are
      held in treasury in order to facilitate the fulfillment of option exercises and RSU releases under the Company's stock option and RSU plans.
(3)   Price paid per share is equal to the USD equivalent of par value, or $0.000706 per share, as of the date of purchase.
