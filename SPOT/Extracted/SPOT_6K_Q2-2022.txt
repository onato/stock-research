Financial Summary
Revenue                                  Revenue of €2,864 million grew 23% Y/Y in Q2 (or 15% Y/Y constant currency), reflecting:

                                              ●        Premium Revenue growth of 22% Y/Y (or 14% Y/Y constant currency), led by subscriber gains; and
                                              ●        Ad-Supported Revenue growth of 31% Y/Y (or 17% Y/Y constant currency), led by music and podcasting gains


Profitability                            Gross Margin was 24.6% in Q2, down 386 bps Y/Y and below guidance due to the decision to stop manufacturing Car
                                         Thing. Excluding the €31 million charge associated with this action and the benefits arising from changes in prior period
                                         estimates for rightsholder liabilities in both the Q2’21 and Q2’22 periods, Adjusted Gross Margin¹ was 25.3%, down 123
                                         bps Y/Y, reflecting:

                                             ●        Continued growth in Marketplace activity and favorable revenue mix shift to podcasting; offset by
                                             ●        Non-music content and product enhancement spend, as well as increased publishing rates

                                         Operating Loss of (€194) million reflected the above and Operating Expense growth of 38% Y/Y (or 28% Y/Y constant
                                         currency), reflecting:

                                             ●        Higher personnel costs primarily due to headcount growth (global ad sales team expansion + acquisitions) and
                                                      higher advertising costs for growth initiatives (Emerging Markets, Gen Z), partially offset by lower Social Charges
                                             ●        Given the geographic mix of employees, currency movements had a negative 968 bps impact on expense growth


                                         Free Cash Flow2 was €37 million in Q2, a slight increase Y/Y as lower Net Income adjusted for non-cash items was offset
Free Cash Flow                           by favorability in net working capital. Liquidity remained strong, with €3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted
& Liquidity                              cash and short term investments. At the end of Q2, our workforce consisted of 9,058 FTEs globally.

Revenue
Consistent Premium growth, led by subscribers
Premium Revenue grew 22% Y/Y to €2,504 million, reflecting subscriber
growth of 14% Y/Y and Premium ARPU¹ growth of 6% Y/Y to €4.54 (or
flat constant currency). Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance
benefited from price increases implemented in the prior year period and
was offset by growth in multi-user accounts.




Ad-Supported % of Total Revenue at new Q2 high
Advertising revenue grew 31% Y/Y to reach 13% of Total Revenue,
reflecting growth across all regions and sales channels. Our music
business saw healthy double-digit growth Y/Y, led by double-digit growth
in CPMs and a mid-single digit increase in impressions sold. Podcast
revenue grew in the strong double-digit range Y/Y, led by the Spotify
Audience Network (where sold impressions grew triple-digits and CPMs
grew healthy double-digits).

Operating Expenses
Growth largely driven by headcount expansion and unfavorable FX impact

Operating Expenses grew 38% Y/Y (or 28% constant
currency), largely reflecting the various growth initiatives that
were greenlit toward the end of 2021 and, to a lesser extent,
the impact of recent acquisitions such as Podsights, Chartable
and Whooshkaa.

As stated at our 2022 Investor Day, much of the expense
growth we are seeing in Q2 is the result of decisions we made
toward the end of 2021 to invest in expanding our global sales
team to drive new international ads monetization potential,
increased marketing for user growth in many of our newer
markets and platform innovation. In June, we announced plans
to slow headcount growth by 25% beginning in Q3, while also
taking a closer look at marketing activity.




                                                                         11
Free Cash Flow
The 9th quarter in a row of positive FCF

Free Cash Flow was €37 million in Q2, a slight increase
Y/Y as lower Net Income adjusted for non-cash items
was offset by favorability in net working capital.

This was the 9th quarter in a row of positive Free
Cash Flow. While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can
fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on seasonality
and timing, we have averaged over €200 million of
positive Free Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis
for the past three years.

       & SUBSCRIBERS   13
Monthly Active
Users (MAUs)
Total MAUs grew 19% Y/Y to 433 million, up from 422 million
last quarter and above our guidance by 5 million. Quarterly
performance versus our guidance was impacted by:

  ●    Outperformance in India, Indonesia and The
       Philippines as a result of marketing campaigns and
       elevated OEM intake

  ●    Strength in Europe largely due to higher reactivations

  ●    Y/Y growth in Gen Z audience in Latin America
       alongside new music releases

Excluding the impact from our Russia exit and the service
outage benefit we experienced in March (representing a
collective 8 million Q1 MAU), we added 19 million MAUs in
the quarter, our largest Q2 in history.




                                                                14
Premium
Subscribers
Our Premium Subscribers grew 14% Y/Y to 188
million, up from 182 million last quarter. Quarterly
performance versus our guidance was impacted by:


  ●     Outperformance across all regions led by
        Europe and Latin America

  ●     Q2 promotional campaign extended one week
        (5 weeks total vs. 4 weeks prior year)
        contributing to subscriber upside

  ●     Multi-user plans continued to exhibit strength

Two-Sided Marketplace & Podcasting
Two-Sided Marketplace
During the quarter, we continued to see triple digit Y/Y
growth in total campaign volume for Sponsored
Recommendations. We also announced new targeting
features for Sponsored Recommendations created in
Spotify for Artists. United States based teams can now
promote eligible new releases to listeners outside of
the United States in 13 new markets — including 7 of
the 10 largest streaming markets in the world.


Podcasting
At the end of Q2, we had 4.4 million podcasts on the
platform. The number of MAUs that engaged with
podcasts grew in the substantial double-digits Y/Y and
per user podcast consumption rates continued to rise.
We released 100 new Original and Exclusive podcasts
globally in Q2 with Batman Unburied hitting #1 in
several key markets. Additionally, video podcasts are
now available to creators via Anchor in 11 markets.




                                                           17
Acquisitions
During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition
of Findaway. Findaway works across the entire
audiobook ecosystem with a platform and offerings
that serve authors, publishers and consumers. Their
technology will help Spotify accelerate its entrance into
the audiobooks market. Additionally, we announced the
acquisition of Sonantic, a dynamic AI voice platform
that creates voices from text. This acquisition, which
closed on July 11, 2022, will allow us to provide new
unique experiences for our users and engage users in
new and more personalized ways.

Spotify Live
Spotify Live, formerly known as Spotify Greenroom,
allows for fans and creators to connect on a deeper and
more scaled level through live listening in the Spotify
ecosystem. Spotify Live can now be found both as the
stand-alone app and as a livestream function in the
Spotify app alongside music and podcasts. Listeners will
be able to tune in to live programming on Spotify via the
creator’s podcast or artist page, and if they want to
participate in the chat or join the host onstage, they
participate via the Spotify Live app to do so.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Adjusted gross margin, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Research
and development expense excluding foreign exchange effect, General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Adjusted gross margin, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Research and development expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors
because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue,
Ad-Supported revenue, Gross margin, Operating expense, Sales and marketing expense, Research and development expense, and General and administrative expense, or other financial measures prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make
investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash
flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS
Results” section below.

services; competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers; risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth; our emphasis on innovation and long-term user engagement
over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to be profitable or generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis; our ability to convince advertisers of the
benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid emerging industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to generate revenues from podcasts and other non-music content;
potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the “Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances; the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health crises; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are concentrated
and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes; the
limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions and ownership thereof embodied in sound recordings in order to
obtain licenses or comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the
dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain user data security; undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities
in our products; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us; risks relating to privacy and data security; our ability to
maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; our ability to achieve our net zero emissions target or make progress in other environmental, social, and governance initiatives; payment-related risks; our dependence on key
personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees; our ability to access to capital to support growth; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange controls; the
impact of economic, social, or political conditions, such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to manage and remediate attempts
to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our
founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from our estimates and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 3, 2022, as updated by subsequently filed reports for our interim results on Form 6-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder update.
