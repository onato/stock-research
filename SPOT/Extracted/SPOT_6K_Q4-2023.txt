                                        optimization charges, €139 million of which were included in Operating Expenses. Excluding these charges,
                                        Adjusted Operating Income* was €68 million and reflected:

                                            ●       Higher Social Charges, which were more than offset by

Revenue
Premium growth led by subscribers and pricing
Premium Revenue grew 17% Y/Y to €3,170 million (or 21% Y/Y constant
currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 15% Y/Y and a Premium
ARPU increase of 1% Y/Y to €4.60 (or up 5% Y/Y constant currency).
Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance was driven by price
increase benefits, partially offset by product and market mix.


Ad-Supported Revenue hits all-time high
Ad-Supported revenue grew 12% Y/Y (or 17% Y/Y constant currency*),
reflecting Y/Y growth across all regions. Music advertising revenue grew
double-digits driven by growth in impressions sold and stable pricing.
Podcast advertising revenue grew in the healthy double-digit range,
driven by significant growth in sold impressions across Original and
Licensed podcasts and the Spotify Audience Network, partially offset by
softer pricing. The Spotify Audience Network saw double digit Q/Q
growth in participating publishers, shows and advertisers.

 Gross Margin finished at 26.7% in Q4, up 140     Premium Gross Margin was 29.1% in Q4, up       Ad-Supported Gross Margin was 11.6%
 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend reflects improvement in   45 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend reflects             in Q4, up 645 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend reflects

Operating Expenses
Y/Y increase driven by efficiency related charges

Operating Expenses grew 2% Y/Y (or 6% constant
currency*) due primarily to €139 million in charges related to
efficiency efforts, which contributed ~1,300 bps to Y/Y growth.
Additionally, Y/Y changes in Social Charge movements of €32
million impacted Y/Y expense growth by ~300 bps. The Y/Y
decline in all other Operating Expenses reflected lower
marketing expenses and a decrease in personnel and related
costs in the quarter.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based
compensation of €33 million in the current period vs. €1 million
in the prior year period.

Free Cash Flow
Building and sustaining a strong balance sheet

Free Cash Flow was €396 million in Q4, an increase Y/Y
as a result of increased favorability in net working capital
and higher Net Income adjusted for non-cash items.
Additionally, capital expenditures declined €4 million Y/Y
to €1 million as a result of the completion of office
build-outs.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged approximately €230 million of positive
Free Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past
three years. On a cumulative basis, we have generated
nearly €2.0 billion of Free Cash Flow since the
beginning of 2016, supporting our strong balance sheet
and €4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash and short term investments balance.

We use investors.spotify.com and newsroom.spotify.com websites as well as other social media listed in the “Resources – Social Media” tab of our Investors website to disclose material company information.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, adjusted operating income/(loss), and Free Cash
Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign
exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and adjusted operating income/(loss) are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance.
However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, gross profit, Operating expense, operating income/(loss), or other financial
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay
debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for
or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of
IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important

ability to generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively,
the “Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and divestitures; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are
concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes;
the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order

attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of
our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and risks
related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from our estimates
and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 2, 2023, as updated by
