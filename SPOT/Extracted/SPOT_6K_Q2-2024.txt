Revenue
Improved Premium growth led by ARPU acceleration
Premium Revenue grew 21% Y/Y to €3,351 million (or 22% Y/Y
constant currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 12% Y/Y and a
Premium ARPU increase of 8% Y/Y to €4.62 (or up 10% Y/Y constant
currency vs. 7% Y/Y in Q1’24). Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU
performance was driven by price increase benefits, partially offset by
product/market mix.

Double-digit advertising growth
Ad-Supported revenue grew 13% Y/Y (or 12% Y/Y constant currency*),
reflecting double digit Y/Y growth across all regions. Music advertising
growth was driven by gains in impressions sold and increased pricing.
Podcast advertising revenue growth was driven by growth in
impressions sold across Original and Licensed podcasts and the
Spotify Audience Network, partially offset by softer pricing. The Spotify
Audience Network saw Q/Q growth in participating publishers and
advertisers.

 Gross Margin finished at 29.2% in Q2, up 510    Premium Gross Margin was 31.4% in Q2, up     Ad-Supported Gross Margin was 13.4%

Operating Expenses
Y/Y declines driven by increased focus on efficiency

Operating Expenses declined 16% Y/Y in Q2. Y/Y changes in
Social Charge movements elevated Y/Y expense growth by
~400 bps while the lapping of the prior year charges related to
efficiency initiatives lowered expense growth by ~700 bps. The
remaining 14% Y/Y decline in Operating Expenses reflected a
decrease in personnel and related costs and lower marketing
spend. Currency movements had a <1% impact on reported
Operating Expense growth.

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based
compensation of €59 million in the current period, €58 million of
which were in Operating Expenses. Prior year period Operating
Expenses included €25 million in Social Charges.

Free Cash Flow
Record performance aids balance sheet strength

Free Cash Flow was €490 million in Q2, a record high
as a result of higher Net Income adjusted for non-cash
items and favorability in net working capital. Capital
expenditures were flat Y/Y at €2 million.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged over €360 million of positive Free
Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past three
years. In Q2, trailing 12 month Free Cash Flow
expanded to €1.3 billion. On a cumulative basis, we
have generated over €2.6 billion of Free Cash Flow
since the beginning of 2016, supporting our strong
balance sheet and €5.4 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments
balance.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, and Operating
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, gross profit, Operating expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow
is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain
infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important
factors may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and

with our new products or services and our emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to generate profit or positive
cash flow on a sustained basis; our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid evolving industry trends in digital advertising; our
ability to generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively,
the “Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and divestitures; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are
concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes;
the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order
to obtain licenses or comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the
dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or
the security of confidential information; undetected errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or vulnerabilities in our products; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of third parties;
changes in laws or regulations affecting us; risks relating to privacy and data security, content moderation, and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks associated with
increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment acceptance-related risks; our dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees; our ability to
access additional capital to support strategic objectives; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions, including inflation,
changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to manage and remediate
attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of
our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and risks
related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from our estimates
and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, as updated by

Social Charges Sensitivity
Meaningful movements in our stock price can lead to Social Charge variance


Our guidance incorporates the impact of Social Charges, the vast majority of which appear in Operating Expenses. The amount of
Social Charges we accrue for and ultimately pay can be volatile, as they are tied to the value of our share price. Since we do not
forecast stock price changes in our guidance, meaningful movements in our stock price over the course of a quarter can lead to
meaningful changes in Social Charges. As an example, at the Q2 close, our stock price was $313.79. In Q3, a 10% increase or
decrease in our stock price compared to the quarter-end price would have an approximate +/- €30M impact on Social Charges.
