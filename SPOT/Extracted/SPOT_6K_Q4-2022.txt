Financial Summary
Revenue                                 Revenue of €3,166 million grew 18% Y/Y in Q4 (or 12% Y/Y constant currency), reflecting:

                                             ●       Premium Revenue growth of 18% Y/Y (or 13% Y/Y constant currency), led by subscriber gains;
                                             ●       Ad-Supported Revenue growth of 14% Y/Y (or 4% Y/Y constant currency), led by podcasting; and
                                             ●       Currency translation benefits of approximately 600 bps (200 bps less than forecast).


Profitability                           Gross Margin was 25.3% in Q4, down 118 bps Y/Y reflecting:

                                            ●        Continued growth in Marketplace activity; offset by
                                            ●        New podcast content and product investments

                                        Operating Loss of (€231) million reflected the above and Operating Expense growth of 44% Y/Y (or 36% Y/Y
                                        constant currency), reflecting:

                                            ●        Higher personnel costs primarily due to headcount growth and higher advertising costs
                                            ●        Currency movements had a negative 751 bps impact on expense growth, or €54 million, given the
                                                     unfavorable geographic mix of employee costs relative to revenue.



Free Cash Flow                          Free Cash Flow was (€73) million in Q4. Capital expenditures decreased €11 million Y/Y to €5 million in the
& Liquidity                             quarter. Liquidity remained strong, with €3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short

                                        denominated investments. At the end of Q4, our workforce consisted of 10,151 FTEs globally.

Revenue
Resilient Premium growth, led by subscribers
Premium Revenue grew 18% Y/Y to €2,717 million, reflecting subscriber
growth of 14% Y/Y and Premium ARPU¹ growth of 3% Y/Y to €4.55 (or
down 1% constant currency). Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU
performance was slightly impacted by product and market mix.



Ad-Supported growth driven by podcasting
Ad-Supported revenue grew 14% Y/Y and accounted for 14% of Total
Revenue. On a global basis, our music advertising revenue grew mid
single digits Y/Y, reflecting double digit Y/Y growth in impressions sold,
partially offset by softer pricing due to the current macroeconomic
environment. Podcast revenue grew in the mid 30% range Y/Y, reflecting
healthy double digit Y/Y growth in impressions sold and pricing. The
Spotify Audience Network saw healthy double digit Q/Q growth in
participating publishers, shows and advertisers.

Operating Expenses
Growth largely driven by headcount expansion and unfavorable FX impact

Operating Expenses grew 44% Y/Y (or 36% constant
currency), driven primarily by higher personnel costs related to
headcount growth (global ad sales team, platform investment
and acquisitions) and higher advertising expenses (Emerging
Markets, Gen Z). These investments largely reflect various
growth initiatives that were greenlit toward the end of 2021 and
the impact of recent acquisitions such as Podsights, Findaway,
Sonantic, Chartable, Whooshkaa and Heardle.

As we stated throughout the last year, 2022 was an investment
year for the company with our Operating Expenses growing
faster than Total Revenue. Moving forward, we expect to see
more company wide efficiencies with our expectation that Total
Revenue will begin to grow faster than Operating Expenses. As
a result, we anticipate a meaningful improvement in our
Operating Expense ratios and Operating Income/(Loss) in 2023
and beyond.




                                                                         11
Free Cash Flow
Building and sustaining a strong balance sheet

Free Cash Flow was (€73) million in Q4, a decrease Y/Y
as a result of lower Net Income adjusted for non-cash
items and reduced favorability in net working capital.
Capital expenditures decreased €11 million Y/Y to €5
million as a result of the completion of office build-outs.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged over €200 million of positive Free
Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past three
years. On a cumulative basis, we have generated over
€1.3 billion of Free Cash Flow since Q1’16, supporting
our strong balance sheet and €3.4 billion in cash and
cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term
investments balance.

MAUS




       & SUBSCRIBERS   13
Monthly Active
Users (MAUs)
Total MAUs grew 20% Y/Y to 489 million, up from 456 million
last quarter and above our guidance by 10 million. Quarterly
performance versus our guidance was impacted by:

  ●     Outperformance in Rest of World led by India and
        Indonesia as a result of successful marketing
        campaigns and OEM strength

  ●     Broad-based MAU strength across nearly all regions,
        aided by 8th annual Wrapped campaign and
        generally stronger performance around the holiday
        season

  ●     Strong growth amongst Gen Z listeners

Q4 MAU net additions of 33 million marked an all-time high
for the company, bringing full year 2022 net adds to a record
high of 83 million (or 88 million excluding the impact of our
Russia exit).



                                                                14
Premium
Subscribers
Our Premium Subscribers grew 14% Y/Y to 205
million, up from 195 million last quarter. Quarterly
performance versus our guidance was impacted by:


  ●     Outperformance across all regions, led by
        Latin America

  ●     Better than expected Q4 promotional
        campaign results across all regions

  ●     Continued strength in multi-user plans

Full year 2022 Subscriber net additions were 25
million (or 27 million excluding the impact of our
Russia exit).

8th Annual Wrapped Campaign




      On November 30, 2022, we launched the 8th annual year-end Spotify Wrapped campaign to users
      in 111 markets. Collectively, 156 million MAUs engaged with Wrapped content in Q4 (up 30% Y/Y)
      and there was strong Y/Y growth in engagement across all regions and demographics. This year
      we included artist merch in the app to help fans get closer to their favorite artists. During the
      Wrapped campaign, we hit the highest-grossing merch sales week for artists in Spotify history. The
      Wrapped campaign also debuted concerts for the first time and serviced concerts engaging
      millions of users, resulting in a 2.7x increase in visitors to artist tour pages.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Research and development
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium
revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing expense excluding foreign exchange
effect, Research and development expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors because they present measures that
facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Operating expense, Sales
and marketing expense, Research and development expense, and General and administrative expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful
to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain infrequently
occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial measures prepared
in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important
factors may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and
services; competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers; risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth; risks associated with our new products or services and our
emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to be profitable or generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis; our
ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid emerging industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to generate revenues from
podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the “Service”); risks relating to
acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are concentrated and can
unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes; the limitations on our
operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order to obtain licenses or
comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the dependence of streaming on
operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology structure and systems or the security of confidential
information; undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities in our products; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us;
risks relating to privacy and data security; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment-related risks; our
dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees; our ability to access to additional capital to support growth; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and interest rates, the continued conflict between Russia and Ukraine,
and supply chain disruptions; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to manage and remediate attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to
certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the
concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A
detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from our estimates and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 3, 2022, as updated by subsequently reports filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder update.
