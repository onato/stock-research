Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)

1.       Corporate information

            Spotify Technology S.A. (the "Company" or "parent") is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company's
registered office is 5, Place de la Gare, L-1616 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
            The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group," "we," "us," or "our") is audio streaming. The Group's
premium service ("Premium Service") provides users with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts. The
Premium Service offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks. The Group's ad-supported service ("Ad-Supported Service" and together with
the Premium Service, the "Service") has no subscription fees and provides users with limited on-demand online access to the catalog of music and unlimited
online access to the catalog of podcasts. The Group depends on securing content licenses from a number of major and minor content owners and other rights
holders in order to provide its service.

2.       Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies

            The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Spotify Technology S.A. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
2022 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The interim financial information is unaudited. The interim financial
information reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2022, as they do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Euros.

New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group

Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12
            On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted the amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes ("IAS 12 Amendment") which requires recognition of deferred
taxes on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. This amendment applies to
differences associated with right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and decommissioning obligations. This amendment is applied to transactions that occurred on or
after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
           We adopted the IAS 12 Amendment effective January 1, 2022 utilizing the modified retrospective method and applied it to our lease transactions.
The adoption of the IAS 12 Amendment did not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12
            The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") published Pillar Two Model Rules to implement the Global Anti-Base
Erosion Rules ("GloBE") introducing a global minimum tax. EU Member States adopted a directive to implement these rules into EU law and are required to
transpose that directive into domestic law by December 31, 2023. The rules are scheduled to apply to the Group beginning January 1, 2024. The rules will
impose a minimum 15% effective tax rate applicable in each jurisdiction in which the Group operates.
            In May 2023, the IASB amended IAS 12 Income Taxes to include a mandatory temporary exception from recognizing deferred taxes relating to
Pillar Two. The Group has applied this mandatory exception and did not have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
            There are no other new International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") or IFRS Interpretation Committee ("IFRIC") interpretations effective
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

New standards and interpretations issued not yet effective

Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1



                                                                              -7-
Table of Contents



            In January 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of
Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. In November 2022, the IASB issued further amendments
delaying the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments are required to be applied on a retrospective
basis. The amendments will require the Group to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes (as defined below) as a current liability if the exchange conditions are met,
even if no noteholder actually requires us to exchange their notes. Adoption of this amendment would not have resulted in the reclassification of the
Exchangeable Notes as a current liability at any reporting date, from the inception of the Exchangeable Notes to September 30, 2023, as the exchange
conditions had not been met.
           There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material impact to the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

3.       Critical accounting estimates and judgments

            Except as noted below, in preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Impairment of real estate assets
            In the second fiscal quarter of 2023, as a result of our Work From Anywhere program and a comprehensive review of our real estate footprint and
space utilization trends (collectively, the "Office Space Optimization Initiative"), we made the strategic decision to reduce our real estate footprint in certain
locations and initiate subleases of these leased office spaces.
            In accordance with IAS 36, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of €90 million, which
represents the write-down of these real estate assets, including lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment, to their recoverable amounts. These
charges are included in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
            To determine the recoverable amounts of these assets, we utilized discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value less cost of disposal. The
development of discounted cash flow models required the application of level 3 inputs and significant judgment in determining market participant assumptions,
including the projected sublease income over the remaining lease terms, expected vacancy periods prior to the commencement of future subleases, expected
lease incentives offered to future tenants, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with these future cash flows.
             The key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amounts as of June 30, 2023 were the sublease rental rates, vacancy periods and pre-tax
discount rates which were determined based on the nature and geographic locations of each office space that we planned to sublease. A change in the sublease
rental rate, vacancy period, or discount rate assumptions may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets that is above or below the current
carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in a future period. We review these key assumptions for possible impairment
reversals and additional impairment charges for each reporting period. See Note 7 and Note 8 for additional information.
            Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events.

5.       Income tax

            The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were 10.9% and (15.1)%, respectively. The effective tax rates for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were (23.4)% and (102.3)%, respectively. The Group operates in a global environment with significant
operations in various jurisdictions outside Luxembourg. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the Group's earnings and
the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions where the Group operates.
             For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the income tax expense of €8 million was due primarily to tax expense resulting from the
utilization of historical share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity to offset current taxable income. For the three months ended September 30,
2022, the income tax expense of €22 million was due primarily to the derecognition of deferred tax assets as a result of decreases in unrealized gains on
investments of €8 million and tax expense of €7 million related to subsidiaries that generate taxable income.
             For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the income tax expense of €88 million was due primarily to €38 million deferred tax expense
related to the derecognition of deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the fair value of the Group’s long term investment in TME, €31 million of tax
expense resulting from the utilization of historical share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity to offset current taxable income, as well as tax
expense of €23 million related to subsidiaries that generate taxable income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax expense of €81
million was due primarily to the impact of utilizing historical share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity of €49 million and tax expense of €21
million related to subsidiaries that generate taxable income.
            Transactions recorded through other comprehensive loss have been shown net of their tax impact, as applicable.
            We are subject to ongoing tax audits in several jurisdictions, and most of these audits involve transfer pricing matters. Tax authorities in certain
jurisdictions have challenged our tax positions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits, taking into account any new information available, in
order to determine the appropriateness of the tax reserves. If management concludes that it is not probable that a tax position will be accepted, the effect of that
uncertainty is reflected at either the most likely amount or the expected value, taking into account a range of possible outcomes.



                                                                                -9-

concluded are not probable to be accepted were €10 million as of September 30, 2023 and €9 million as of December 31, 2022. None of the provisions related
to uncertain tax positions are reasonably expected to be resolved within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties included in income tax expense were not
material in any of the periods presented. Due to the uncertainty associated with our tax positions, any future agreement with the tax authorities could have a
significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
            Net deferred tax assets of €17 million and €3 million have been recorded in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. In evaluating the probability of realizing deferred tax assets, the Group considered all available
positive and negative evidence of future taxable income, primarily past operating results. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, deferred tax assets
of €803 million and €598 million have not been recognized.

6.       Earnings/(loss) per share

            Basic earnings/(loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares during the period. Diluted
earnings/(loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary shares and potential outstanding ordinary shares during the
period. Potential ordinary shares, which are based on the weighted-average ordinary shares underlying outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, other
contingently issuable shares, warrants, and Exchangeable Notes and computed using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are
included when calculating diluted earnings/(loss) per share when their effect is dilutive. The computation of earnings/(loss) per share for the respective periods
is as follows:

           Excluded from the lease commitments above are short term leases. Expenses relating to short term leases were approximately €1 million for both
the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and €3 million and €4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Additionally, the Group has entered into certain lease agreements with approximately €40 million of commitments, which had not commenced as of
September 30, 2023 and, as such, have not been recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position.
            The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of
financial position as of September 30, 2023 was 6.4%.

15.      Exchangeable Notes

           On March 2, 2021, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Spotify USA Inc. (the “Issuer”), issued US$1,500 million aggregate principal amount
of 0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”), which included the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an
additional US$200 million principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased,
redeemed or exchanged. The Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis by the Company.
           The net proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting transaction costs of €18 million. The transaction
costs were immediately expensed and included in finance costs in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2021.
             The Exchangeable Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with the Issuer's future senior, unsecured
indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Exchangeable Notes and effectively
subordinated to the Issuer’s future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Exchangeable Notes will be
structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Issuer is not a holder thereof) preferred
equity, if any, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.
            The noteholders may exchange their Exchangeable Notes at their option into consideration that consists, at the Issuer’s election, of cash, ordinary
shares of the Company, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, but only under certain circumstances as set forth in the indenture governing the
Exchangeable Notes (the "Indenture"). The circumstances required to allow the noteholders to exchange their Exchangeable Notes were not met during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023.
           The Exchangeable Notes will not be redeemable prior to March 20, 2024, except in the event of certain tax law changes as set forth in the Indenture.
The Exchangeable Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Issuer’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2024 and on or
before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable
Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of
the exchange price on:
         (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day
         immediately before the date the Issuer sends the related redemption notice; and
         (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends such notice.
           In addition, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Exchangeable Notes if certain changes in tax law as set forth in
the Indenture occur. In addition, calling any Exchangeable Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that
Exchangeable Note, in which case the exchange rate applicable to the exchange of that Exchangeable Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is
exchanged after it is called for redemption.
             Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” as set forth in the Indenture, noteholders may require the Issuer to repurchase their Exchangeable
Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date as set forth in the Indenture.
           The Group accounted for the Exchangeable Notes at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS 9,
Financial Instruments. The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes as of September 30, 2023 was €1,209 million. See Note 19 for information regarding the key
inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes.

         On January 23, 2023, the Company announced a reorganization to streamline our organizational structure and reduce our operating costs. As part of
such reorganization, we reduced our employee base by approximately 6% across the Company. Additionally, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, the
Company executed a strategic realignment and reorganization plan focusing on podcast operations and rationalizing our content portfolio.
       In connection with these reorganizations, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized charges of €69 million consisting of
employee severance of €60 million and contract terminations and other related costs of €9 million.
         These charges are included within the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations as follows:
                                                                                                                                                Nine months ended

            Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. The results of such legal proceedings
are difficult to predict and the extent of the Group's financial exposure is difficult to estimate. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is
both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
             As of April 2019, the Group's settlement of the Ferrick et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 1:16-cv-8412-AJN (S.D.N.Y.), putative class action lawsuit,
which alleged that the Group unlawfully reproduced and distributed musical compositions without obtaining licenses, was final and effective. Even with the
effectiveness of the settlement, we may still be subject to claims of copyright infringement by rights holders who have purported to opt out of the settlement or
who may not otherwise be covered by its terms. The Music Modernization Act of 2018 contains a limitation of liability with respect to such lawsuits filed on or
after January 1, 2018. Rights holders may, nevertheless, file lawsuits, and may argue that they should not be bound by this limitation of liability. For example,
in August 2019, the Eight Mile Style, LLC et al v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 3:19-cv-00736-AAT, lawsuit was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Tennessee, alleging both that the Group does not qualify for the limitation of liability in the Music Modernization Act and that the limitation
of liability is unconstitutional and, thus, not valid law. The Group intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit, including plaintiffs' challenges to the limitation of
liability in the Music Modernization Act.

19.      Financial instruments

Foreign exchange forward contracts
Cash flow hedges
             The Group's currency pairs used for cash flow hedges are Euro / U.S. dollar, Euro / Australian dollar, Euro / British pound, Euro / Swedish krona,
Euro / Canadian dollar, and Euro / Norwegian krone. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts hedging the revenue and cost of revenue line items
in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations was approximately €1,385 million and €964 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023, and
approximately €1,214 million and €859 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.

Fair values
           The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, restricted cash, trade and

Recurring fair value measurements
Long term investment - Tencent Music Entertainment Group
            The Group's approximate 8% investment in TME is carried at fair value through other comprehensive loss. The fair value of ordinary shares of
TME is based on the ending New York Stock Exchange American depository share price. The fair value of the investment in TME may vary over time and is
subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macro-economic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate and systemic risks of the equity
markets overall.

           A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from
€768 million to €939 million at September 30, 2023.

Long term investments - other
            The Group has interests in certain long term investments, the most significant of which is our equity investment in DistroKid, an independent
digital music distribution service. These long term investments primarily represent unlisted equity securities carried at fair value through other comprehensive
loss. The fair values of these equity investments are generally determined using business enterprise values based on market transactions or by (i) applying
market multiples to the projected financial performance and (ii) discounting the future value to its present value equivalent. The key assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of these equity investments include market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
for benchmark companies used to estimate business enterprise value and discount rate.
            The fair value of the long term investments may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macroeconomic,
regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate, and systemic risks of the overall equity markets.

Contingent consideration
            On April 1, 2019, the Group acquired Cutler Media, LLC ("Parcast"), a premier storytelling podcast studio. Included in the purchase price was €13
million related to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration is valued by the Group using a simulation of user
engagement outcomes. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized within general and administrative expenses in the interim
condensed consolidated statement of operations.

            The change in estimated fair value is recognized within finance income/(costs) in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations,
excluding changes in fair value due to changes in the Group’s own credit risk, which are recognized in other comprehensive loss and will not be reclassified to
the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations.
           The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was estimated using a combination of a binomial option pricing model and prices observed for the
Exchangeable Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period. A weight of 75% was applied to the binomial option pricing
model and a weight of 25% was applied to the price of the Exchangeable Notes in the over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period.
The key assumptions used in the binomial option pricing model for the Exchangeable Notes were as follows:
                                                                                                                                               September 30, 2023

            A decrease or increase of 10 percentage points in volatility would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,200
million to €1,221 million at September 30, 2023. A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the
Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,205 million to €1,213 million at September 30, 2023. A decrease or increase of 100 basis points in credit spread would
have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,229 million to €1,188 million at September 30, 2023.

20.      Segment information

            The Group has two reportable segments: Premium and Ad-Supported. Revenue for the Premium segment is generated primarily through
subscription fees. Revenue for the Ad-Supported segment is primarily generated through the sale of advertising across the Group's music and podcast content.
Royalty costs are primarily recorded in each segment based on specific rates for each segment agreed to with rights holders. All podcast content costs are
recorded in the Ad-Supported segment. The remaining costs that are not specifically associated to either of the segments are allocated based on user activity or
the revenue recognized in each segment. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.

where the advertising campaign is delivered. There are no countries that individually make up greater than 10% of total revenue included in "Other countries."

                                                                                                                         September 30, 2023          December 31, 2022

Contingencies
            Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. These may include, but are not limited
to, matters relating to intellectual property, data protection, consumer protection, employment, and contractual rights. As a general matter, the music and other
content made available on the Group's Service are licensed to the Group by various third parties. Many of these licenses allow rights holders to audit the
Group's royalty payments, and any such audit could result in disputes over whether the Group has paid the proper royalties. If such a dispute were to occur, the
Group could be required to pay additional royalties, and the amounts involved could be material. The Group expenses legal fees as incurred. The Group records
a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An
unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Group's operations or its financial position, liquidity, or results of
operations.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

            This discussion and analysis reflects our historical results of operations and financial position and contains estimates and forward-looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The words "may," "might," "will," "could," "would,"
"should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "intend," "seek," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "contemplate," "possible," and similar words
are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.
             Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect
or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions,
they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important factors may adversely affect
our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to:

         •          our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and services;
         •          competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers;
         •          risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth;
         •          risks associated with our new products or services and our emphasis on long term user engagement over short term results;
         •          our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy;
         •          our ability to be profitable or generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis;
         •          our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings;
         •          our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid emerging industry trends in digital advertising;
         •          our ability to generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content;
         •          potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our Service (as defined above);
         •          risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances;
         •          our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream;
         •          our lack of control over third-party content providers who are concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content;
         •          our ability to comply with complex license agreements;
         •          our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes;
         •          the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements;
         •          our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order to obtain licenses or comply with
                    existing license agreements;
         •          assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights;
         •          our ability to protect our intellectual property;
         •          the dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control;
         •          our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology structure and systems or the security of confidential information;
         •          undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in our products;
         •          interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of third parties;
         •          changes in laws or regulations affecting us;
         •          risks relating to privacy and data security;
         •          our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand;
         •          risks associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters;
         •          payment-related risks;
         •          our dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees;
         •          our ability to access additional capital to support growth;
         •          risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange controls;
         •          the impact of economic, social, or political conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the
                    Middle East, and related market uncertainty;
         •          our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates;
         •          our ability to manage and remediate attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of
                    our Service;
         •          risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes;



                                                                                - 27 -

         •          fluctuation of our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares;
         •          tax-related risks;
         •          the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and business; and
         •          risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company.

             We operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to
predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor are we able to assess the impact of all of these risk factors on our business or the extent to which any risk factor, or
combination of risk factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
             We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed
under Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 ("Annual Report on Form 20-F") and in our
other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
           You should read this discussion and analysis completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from
our expectations.
            Investors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our Investors website
(investors.spotify.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and webcasts. We use these channels, as well as social media, to communicate with
our users and the public about our company, our Service, and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on these channels could be deemed to be
material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our Company to review the information we post on the channels
listed on our Investors website.

Overview

           Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans
the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.
           We are the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service. With a presence in 184 countries and territories, our platform includes 574
million monthly active users ("MAUs"), including 226 million Premium Subscribers (as defined below) as of September 30, 2023.
          We currently monetize our Service through both subscriptions and advertising. Our Premium Subscribers have grown 16% year-over-year, as of
September 30, 2023, to 226 million. Our 574 million MAUs have grown 26% year-over-year, as of September 30, 2023.

           Our results reflect the effects of our trial programs, both discounted and free trials, in addition to seasonal trends in user behavior and, with respect
to our Ad-Supported segment, advertising behavior. Historically, Premium Subscriber growth accelerates when we run such trial programs.
            For our Ad-Supported segment, typically we experience higher advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater
advertising demand during the holiday season. However, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we typically experience a seasonal decline in advertising
revenue due to reduced advertiser demand.

Audiobooks in Premium
            On October 3, 2023, the Company announced the launch of audiobooks on our Premium Service, offering up to 15 hours of access a month to more
than 150,000 audiobooks as part of a subscription to the Premium Service. Currently, audiobooks are available for eligible Premium Subscribers in the U.K.
and Australia.
Reorganization
            In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company announced a reorganization to streamline our organizational structure and reduce our operating
costs. As part of such reorganization, we reduced our employee base by approximately 6% across the Company. See Note 17 to our interim condensed
consolidated financial statements for further details.
             In the second fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company executed a strategic realignment and reorganization plan focusing on podcast operations and to
rationalize our content portfolio. See Note 12 and Note 17 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further details.



                                                                                 - 28 -

Impairment of real estate assets
            In the second fiscal quarter of 2023, as a result of our Work From Anywhere program and a comprehensive review of our real estate footprint and
space utilization trends (collectively, the "Office Space Optimization Initiative"), we made the strategic decision to reduce our real estate footprint in certain
locations and initiate subleases of these leased office spaces. As a result of this initiative, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized a non-
cash impairment charge of €90 million, which represents the write-down of these real estate assets, including lease right-of-use assets and property and
equipment. See Note 3 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further details.
Current macroeconomic environment
             The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, reflecting the impacts of inflation, changes in interest rates, geopolitical
conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty.
            The continued impact of the macroeconomic environment on our business, financial condition, and results of operations is uncertain and will vary
by region or market. We will continue to actively monitor and respond accordingly to the macroeconomic environment.
            For additional information refer to Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Key Performance Indicators

           We use certain key performance indicators to monitor and manage our business. We use these indicators to evaluate our business, measure our
performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe these indicators provide useful
information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner we do.
MAUs
            We track MAUs as an indicator of the size of the audience engaged with our Service. We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users
and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated. Reported MAUs
may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Service within a thirty-day period as one individual may register for, and use, multiple
accounts. Additionally, though we strive to detect and minimize non-bona fide accounts that may typically be created in an attempt to artificially stream
content, they may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement in our reported MAUs. Our MAUs in the tables below are inclusive of Ad-Supported
Users who may have employed methods to limit or otherwise avoid being served advertisements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed
under Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, and in our other filings with the SEC.

Premium ARPU
            Premium average revenue per user ("ARPU") is a monthly measure defined as Premium subscription revenue recognized in the quarter indicated
divided by the average daily Premium Subscribers in such quarter, which is then divided by three months. Fiscal year-to-date figures are calculated by
averaging Premium ARPU for the quarters in such period.
           The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.
                                     Three months ended September                                        Nine months ended September

           For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Premium ARPU was €4.34 and €4.63, respectively, which represented a decrease of 6%.
This decrease of €0.29 is primarily attributable to unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, reducing Premium ARPU by €0.23.
           For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Premium ARPU was €4.31 and €4.52, respectively, which represented a decrease of 5%.
The decrease of €0.21 is primarily attributable to unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, reducing Premium ARPU by €0.12, and changes in
product and market mix, reducing ARPU by €0.09 .

How We Generate Revenue

           We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments - Premium and Ad-Supported. We identify our reportable segments based on the
organizational units used by the chief operating decision maker to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 20 to our interim condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments.




                                                                            - 30 -
Table of Contents




Premium
            We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of the Premium Service. The Premium Service is sold directly to end users and
through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone
subscriptions from their end customers. Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. We also
bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.
Ad-Supported
             We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising
impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on behalf of their
clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-thousand basis
and are evidenced by an insertion order that specifies the terms of the arrangement such as the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number
of impressions or downloads in a stated period. Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal
self-serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis. These advertising arrangements
typically specify the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions in a stated period.
Components of our Operating Results
             Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming. We incur royalty costs,
which we pay to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders, for the right to stream music to our users. Royalties are typically calculated
monthly based on the combination of a number of different variables. Generally, Premium Service royalties are based on the greater of a percentage of revenue
and a per user amount. Royalties for the Ad-Supported Service are typically a percentage of relevant revenue, although certain agreements are based on the
greater of a percentage of relevant revenue and an amount for each time a sound recording and musical composition are streamed. We have negotiated lower
per user amounts for our lower priced subscription plans such as our Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan. In our agreements with certain record labels, the
percentage of revenue used in the calculation of royalties is generally dependent upon certain targets being met. The targets can include such measures as the
number of Premium Subscribers, the ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, and/or the rates of Premium Subscriber churn. In addition, royalty
rates vary by country. Some of our royalty agreements require that royalty costs be paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. For the
majority of royalty agreements, incremental costs incurred due to unrecouped advances and minimum guarantees have not been significant to date. We also
have certain so-called most favored nation royalty agreements, which require us to record additional costs if certain material contract terms are not as favorable
as the terms we have agreed to with similar licensors. Cost of revenue also reflects discounts provided by certain rights holders in return for promotional
activities in connection with marketplace programs. Additionally, it includes the costs of discounted trials.
            Cost of revenue also includes the cost of podcast content assets (both produced and licensed). Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded
over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period (if relevant) and begins at the release of each episode. We make payments to podcast
publishers, whose content we monetize through advertising sales, which are also included in cost of revenue.
            Cost of revenue also includes credit card and payment processing fees for subscription revenue, customer service, certain employee compensation
and benefits, cloud computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs.
             Research and Development. We invest heavily in research and development in order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction on our
platform, which we believe helps drive organic growth in MAUs, which, in turn, drives additional growth in, and better retention of, Premium Subscribers, as
well as increased advertising opportunities to our users. We aim to design products and features that create and enhance user experiences, and new technologies
are at the core of many of these opportunities. Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for the development of products related to our platform and Service,
as well as new advertising products and improvements to our mobile application and desktop application and streaming services. The costs incurred include
related facility costs, consulting costs, and employee compensation and benefits costs. We expect engineers to represent a significant portion of our employees
over the foreseeable future.
           Many of our new products and improvements to our platform require large investments and involve substantial time and risks to develop and
launch. Some of these products may not be well received or may take a long time for users to adopt. As a result, the benefits of our research and development
investments are difficult to forecast.
           Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, public relations, branding, consulting
expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, marketing events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with
music record labels, publishers, songwriters, and artists to



                                                                              - 31 -

promote the availability of new releases on our platform, and the costs of providing free trials. Expenses included in the cost of providing free trials are derived
primarily from per user royalty fees determined in accordance with the rights holder agreements.
            General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits for functions such as
finance, accounting, analytics, legal, human resources, consulting fees, and other costs including facility and equipment costs, directors' and officers’ liability
insurance, director fees, and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration.

Premium revenue
            For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Premium revenue comprised 87% of our total revenue. For the three months ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, Premium revenue increased €259 million, or 10%. The increase was due
primarily to an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in Premium ARPU of 6%, primarily attributable to unfavorable
movements in foreign exchange rates, as noted above.

            For both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Premium revenue comprised 88% of our total revenue. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Premium revenue increased €862 million, or 11%. The increase was due
primarily to an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in Premium ARPU of 5%, primarily attributable to unfavorable
movements in foreign exchange rates and changes in product and market mix, as noted above.

Ad-Supported revenue
            For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 13% of our total revenue. For the three months
ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, Ad-Supported revenue increased €62 million, or 16%. This increase
was due primarily to growth in music impressions sold through our direct and programmatic channels and growth in ad sales from podcasts, collectively
increasing revenue by €63 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

            For both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 12% of our total revenue. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Ad-Supported revenue increased €153 million, or 15%. The increase
was due primarily to growth in music impressions sold, which increased revenue in our direct and programmatic channels by €92 million. Ad sales from
podcasts, partially offset by our self-serve platform, also increased revenue by €42 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Foreign exchange impact on total revenue
           The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, had an unfavorable net impact on our revenue. We estimate that total revenue for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been approximately €188 million and €256 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates had
remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable period in 2022.

Premium cost of revenue
            For the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, Premium cost of revenue increased
€154 million, or 8%, and Premium cost of revenue as a percentage of Premium revenue decreased from 72% to 71%. The increase in Premium cost of revenue
was driven primarily by increases in new Premium Subscribers and music licensing costs, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs. These
collectively resulted in higher royalty costs of €160 million. This increase was offset by a decrease in streaming delivery fees of €7 million. The three months
ended September 30, 2022 also included a net €11 million increase in costs related to changes in prior period estimates for rights holder liabilities.

            For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Premium cost of revenue increased
€567 million, or 10%, and Premium cost of revenue as a percentage of Premium revenue decreased from 72% to 71%. The increase in Premium cost of revenue
was driven primarily by increases in new Premium Subscribers and music licensing costs, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs. These
collectively resulted in higher royalty costs of €534 million. Additionally, there was an increase in payment processing fees of €16 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a charge of €24 million related to excess and obsolete inventory and adverse
purchase commitment with no comparable charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Ad-Supported cost of revenue
             For the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, Ad-Supported cost of revenue
increased €32 million, or 8%, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue decreased from 98% to 92%. The increase in Ad-
Supported cost of revenue was driven primarily by higher royalty costs of €33 million due to growth in both advertising revenue and streams, partially offset by
benefits from certain marketplace programs for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023
also benefited from a decrease of €9 million primarily related to reduction in personnel costs and to a lesser extent reduction in streaming delivery costs.
             For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Ad-Supported cost of revenue
increased €156 million, or 15%, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue increased from 99% to 100%. The increase in Ad-
Supported cost of revenue was driven primarily by a €30 million charge for the write-off of content assets, a €9 million charge for contract terminations and
other related costs, and a €9 million charge for employee severance. There was also an increase in podcast costs of €24 million partially offset by decreases in
costs to deliver enhanced product features of €9 million. Additionally, there was an increase in royalty costs of €61 million due to growth in both advertising
revenue and streams, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Foreign exchange impact on total cost of revenue
            The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, had a favorable net impact on our cost of revenue. We estimate that total cost of revenue for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been approximately €143 million and €194 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates
had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable period in 2022.

Premium gross profit and gross margin
             For the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, Premium gross profit increased by
€105 million, and Premium gross margin increased from 28% to 29%. Premium gross margin increased due primarily to benefits from certain marketplace
programs partially offset by increases in music licensing costs. Also contributing to the increase in margin were changes in prior period estimates for rights
holder liabilities recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2022. Gross margin also benefited from a decrease in streaming delivery costs during
the three months ended September 30, 2023.

            For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Premium gross profit increased by
€295 million, and Premium gross margin increased from 28% to 29%. Premium gross margin increased due primarily to benefits from certain marketplace
programs partially offset by increases in music licensing costs. Also contributing to the increase in margin was a €24 million charge related to excess and
obsolete inventory and adverse purchase commitment recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with no comparable charges in nine months
ended September 30, 2023.

Ad-Supported gross profit and gross margin
           For the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, Ad-Supported gross profit increased
by €30 million, and gross margin increased from 2% to 8%. The increase in Ad-Supported gross margin was due primarily to revenue growth outpacing the
growth in content costs. Additionally, the increase in gross margin during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was supported by a reduction in
personnel costs and streaming delivery costs.

             For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Ad-Supported gross profit decreased
by €3 million, and gross margin decreased from 1% to 0%. The decrease in Ad-Supported gross margin was due primarily to charges for the write-off of
content assets, employee severance, and contract terminations and other related costs during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Additionally, there was an
increase in royalty costs due to growth in both advertising revenue and streams, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs and a decrease
in costs incurred to deliver enhanced product features during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

           For the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, research and development costs
decreased by €17 million, or 4%. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in share-based compensation of €12 million, a decrease in costs for consultants
and external contractors of €11 million, and a decrease in employee travel of €9 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries of €20
million.

            For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, research and development costs
increased €285 million, or 29%. The increase was due primarily to an increase in personnel-related costs of €239 million that included increased salaries, share-
based compensation, and other employee benefits as a result of increased headcount, and an increase in social costs due primarily to changes in share price
movements. There was also an increase in information technology costs of €18 million due to increase in our usage of cloud computing services and additional
software license fees. In addition, there were impairment charges on real estate assets of €44 million and employee severance costs of €26 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs for consultants and external contractors of €20 million and a

            For the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, finance income decreased €47 million
due primarily to a decrease of €43 million in foreign exchange gains on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in a transaction currency other
than the functional currency. There was also a decrease in the benefits recognized from the decline in the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes of €28 million.
These decreases were partially offset by a €19 million increase in interest income.

              For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, finance income decreased €280 million.

             For the three months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense was €8 million. The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023
was due primarily to tax expense resulting from the utilization of historical share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity to offset current taxable
income. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, income tax expense of €22 million was due primarily to the derecognition of deferred tax assets as a
result of decreases in unrealized gains on investments of €8 million and tax expense of €7 million related to subsidiaries that generate taxable income.

ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to €38 million deferred tax expense related to the derecognition of deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease
in the fair value of the Group’s long term investment in TME, €31 million of tax expense resulting from the utilization of historical share-based compensation
deductions recognized in equity to offset current taxable income, as well as tax expense of €23 million related to subsidiaries that generate taxable income. The
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was due primarily to the impact of utilizing historical share-based compensation deductions recognized
in equity of €49 million and tax expense of €21 million related to subsidiaries that generate taxable income.

Non-IFRS financial measure
           We have reported our financial results in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB. In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-IFRS
measure of Free Cash Flow as discussed below.
            We define "Free Cash Flow" as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in restricted cash. We believe Free
Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Free Cash
Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities.
            Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance. Because Free Cash
Flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. You should not consider Free Cash Flow in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported on our
interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document.

           Set forth below is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.
                                                                                                                             Nine months ended September 30,

Liquidity and Capital Resources

           Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operating activities. Cash and
cash equivalents and short term investments consist mostly of time deposits, investments in money market funds, and investments in government securities,
corporate notes, and fixed income funds. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by €365 million from €3,350 million as of
December 31, 2022 to €3,715 million as of September 30, 2023.
             We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and the cash flow we generate from our operations will be sufficient to
meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital
requirements may be materially different than those currently planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our
rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on content and research and development, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the
timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, our continued international expansion, the acquisition of other companies, competitive
factors, and global economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business
activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to
our shareholders, while the incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce covenants that
might restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. For additional information, refer to
Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.
            We continue to evaluate our real estate footprint to optimize our global office space while making necessary investments in offices and information
technology infrastructure to grow our business. We fund these investments using current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow we generate from
operations. Given the impact of our Work From Anywhere



                                                                              - 37 -

program and in conjunction with a strategic review of our real estate footprint and space utilization trends, our focus has shifted more towards optimizing our
current portfolio and reviewing our real estate needs around the world as opposed to significant expansion of our presence in current markets. This has resulted
in a reduction of our real estate footprint as we have decided to sublease certain leased office space. See Note 3 to our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for further details.
Share repurchase program
            On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s
ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares were authorized at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders on
April 21, 2021. The repurchase program will expire on April 21, 2026. Since the commencement of this repurchase program and through September 30, 2023,
469,274 ordinary shares were repurchased for €91 million under this program.
             The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and
alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program is executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to
grow the business over the long term. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares, and the
repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company uses current cash and cash equivalents and the
cash flow it generates from operations to fund the share repurchase program.
Exchangeable notes
         On March 2, 2021, Spotify USA Inc. issued US$1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. Net proceeds from the
issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting the transaction costs. See Note 15 to our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for further information regarding our Exchangeable Notes.

         "Non-IFRS Financial Measure" above.


Operating activities
            Net cash flows from operating activities increased by €167 million to €283 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in operating loss adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation,
amortization, impairment charges on real estate assets, write-off of content assets, and share-based compensation expense, resulting in an increase in cash flows
from operating activities of €173 million in aggregate. There was also an increase in interest received on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
of €60 million. These increases were partially offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital movements of €61 million, principally due to unfavorable
movements in trade and other liabilities and trade receivables and other assets partially offset by favorable changes in deferred revenue.


Investing activities
            Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by €110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was due primarily to cash consideration used in business combinations, net of cash acquired, of €295 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, whereas no such activity occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was also a
decrease in purchases of property and equipment of €15 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows from purchases and
sales and maturities of short term investments of €212 million.

Financing activities
            Net cash flows from financing activities increased by €59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to an increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of €99 million, partially offset by
an increase in payments for lease liabilities of €24 million.


Free Cash Flow
           Free Cash Flow increased by €188 million to €282 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, due primarily to an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of €167 million, as described above, and a decrease in capital
expenditures of €15 million.

Restrictions on subsidiaries to transfer funds
             The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Company by the Company's direct subsidiaries and by its
indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are subject to various restrictions. Future indebtedness of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of
dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Company. In addition, the ability of any of the Company's direct or indirect subsidiaries to
make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial
assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, liquidity requirements, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution, and other
legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. Spotify AB, which, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries,
conducts much of the Group's business, may only make dividends to the Company if there would continue to be full coverage of its restricted equity following
such dividend, and only if doing so would be considered prudent under Swedish law given the needs of Spotify AB and its subsidiaries. Loans and other
advances from Spotify AB to the Company may be subject to essentially the same restrictions as dividends. Since the Company is expected to rely primarily on
dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries to fund its financial and other obligations, restrictions on its ability to receive such funds may adversely
impact the Company's ability to fund its financial and other obligations.
Indebtedness
             As of September 30, 2023, our outstanding indebtedness, other than lease liabilities, consisted primarily of the Exchangeable Notes that mature on
March 15, 2026 and bear no interest. See Note 15 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our
Exchangeable Notes. We may from time to time seek to incur additional indebtedness. Such indebtedness, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions,
our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

             As of September 30, 2023, we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or
special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that
expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

            Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks. Our primary market risk exposures relate to currency, interest rate, share price, and investment
risks. To manage these risks and our exposure to the unpredictability of financial markets, we seek to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial
performance and capital.
             Volatile market conditions caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, inflation, changes in interest
rates, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty, may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates, interest
rates, and share prices, both our own and those of third parties we use to value certain of our long term investments. Refer to Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in
our Annual Report on Form 20-F for further discussion on the impact of worldwide economic conditions on our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Currency risk
            Currency risk manifests itself in transaction exposure, which relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by
operations (purchasing and selling) and/or financing (interest and amortization). The volatility in foreign exchange rates, in particular a weakening of foreign
currencies relative to the Euro, may negatively affect our revenue. Our general policy is to hedge transaction exposure on a case-by-case basis. Translation
exposure relates to net investments in foreign operations. We do not conduct translation risk hedging.
Transaction exposure sensitivity
             In most cases, our customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental fees are
settled in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily settled in Euros and U.S. dollars. Hence, the operational need to net purchase foreign currency is
due primarily to a deficit from such settlements.
             The table below shows the immediate impact on Income/(loss) before tax of a 10% strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro in the
closing exchange rate of significant currencies to which we have transaction exposure, at September 30, 2023. The sensitivity associated with a 10% weakening
of a particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.

Translation Exposure Sensitivity
           The impact on our equity would be approximately €113 million if the Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on
the exposure at September 30, 2023.
Interest rate risk
             Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on earnings and cash flow. Our exposure to interest rate risk is
related to our interest-bearing assets, primarily our short term debt securities. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield of the investment. The sensitivity
analysis considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and we determined that it was reasonably possible that a change of 100 basis points could
be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have impacted interest income by €13 million and €29 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
Share price risk
           Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the
Company's ordinary share price. Our exposure to this risk relates primarily to the Exchangeable Notes, outstanding warrants, and accrual for social costs on
outstanding share-based compensation awards.
           A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from
€1,205 million to €1,213 million at September 30, 2023.
            A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the warrants ranging from €2 million to €5
million at September 30, 2023.
           A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a decrease or increase in the accrual for social costs on
outstanding share-based compensation awards of €12 million and €16 million, respectively at September 30, 2023.
Investment risk
            We are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our long term investments, due primarily to volatility in the share
price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of our long term investments relate to TME. A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share
price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from €768 million to €939 million at September 30, 2023.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
            We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Preparing these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related
disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
           We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue, share-based compensation, content, warrants, Exchangeable Notes,
business combinations, the incremental borrowing rate, impairment of non-financial assets, and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our interim
condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.
            Except for the impairment related to real estate assets presented below, there have been no material changes or additions to our critical accounting
policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.
Impairment of real estate assets
            In the second fiscal quarter of 2023, as a result of our Office Space Optimization Initiative, we made the strategic decision to reduce our real estate
footprint in certain locations and initiate subleases of these leased office spaces.
            In accordance with IAS 36, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of €90 million, which
represents the write-down of these real estate assets, including lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment, to their recoverable amounts. These
charges are included in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
          To determine the recoverable amounts of these assets, we utilized discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value less cost of disposal. The
development of discounted cash flow models required the application of level 3 inputs and



                                                                                - 41 -

significant judgment in determining market participant assumptions, including the projected sublease income over the remaining lease terms, expected vacancy
periods prior to the commencement of future subleases, expected lease incentives offered to future tenants, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk
associated with these future cash flows.
             The key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amounts as of June 30, 2023 were the sublease rental rates, vacancy periods and pre-tax
discount rates which were determined based on the nature and geographic locations of each office space that we planned to sublease. A change in the sublease
rental rate, vacancy period, or discount rate assumptions may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets that is above or below the current
carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in a future period. We review these key assumptions for possible impairment
reversals and additional impairment charges for each reporting period. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this report for additional information.
Recent accounting pronouncements

Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12
            On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted the amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes ("IAS 12 Amendment") which requires recognition of deferred
taxes on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. This amendment applies to
differences associated with right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and decommissioning obligations. This amendment is applied to transactions that occurred on or
after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
           We adopted the IAS 12 Amendment effective January 1, 2022 utilizing the modified retrospective method and applied it to our lease transactions.
The adoption of the IAS 12 Amendment did not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12
            The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") published Pillar Two Model Rules to implement the Global Anti-Base
Erosion Rules ("GloBE") introducing a global minimum tax. EU Member States adopted a directive to implement these rules into EU law and are required to
transpose that directive into domestic law by December 31, 2023. The rules are scheduled to apply to the Group beginning January 1, 2024. The rules will
impose a minimum 15% effective tax rate applicable in each jurisdiction in which the Group operates.
            In May 2023, the IASB amended IAS 12 Income Taxes to include a mandatory temporary exception from recognizing deferred taxes relating to
Pillar Two. The Group has applied this mandatory exception and did not have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
            There are no other new International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") or IFRS Interpretation Committee ("IFRIC") interpretations effective
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to our
interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.

                                                              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

              We are from time to time subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other legal
proceedings involve highly complex issues, and often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, our potential liability with respect to a
large portion of such claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty. Management, with the assistance of legal counsel,
periodically reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation
when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of
litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. If management's estimates prove incorrect, current reserves
could be inadequate and we could incur a charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and
cash flows.

            For a discussion of legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 18 and Note 21 to our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report.
