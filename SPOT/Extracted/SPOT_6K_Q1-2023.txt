Financial Summary
Revenue                                 Revenue of €3,042 million grew 14% Y/Y in Q1 (or 13% Y/Y constant currency), reflecting:

                                             ●       Premium Revenue growth of 14% Y/Y (or 13% Y/Y constant currency), led by subscriber gains; and
                                             ●       Ad-Supported Revenue growth of 17% Y/Y (or 13% Y/Y constant currency)

Profitability                           Gross Margin was 25.2% in Q1, flat Y/Y reflecting:

                                            ●        Continued growth in Marketplace activity and improvement in podcast profitability; offset by
                                            ●        Higher Other Cost of Revenue

                                        Operating Loss of (€156) million reflected the above and Operating Expense growth of 36% Y/Y (or 34% Y/Y
                                        constant currency), reflecting:

                                            ●        Higher personnel costs due primarily to Y/Y headcount growth; partially offset by
                                            ●        Lower marketing and legal costs

                                        Additionally, Operating Expense growth was impacted by:

                                            ●        Y/Y changes in Social Charges, which accounted for roughly one third of Operating Expense growth; and
                                            ●        Severance-related charges associated with our Q1 workforce reduction, which had an unfavorable ~600

Free Cash Flow                          Free Cash Flow was €57 million in Q1. Capital expenditures decreased €8 million Y/Y to €2 million in the
& Liquidity                             quarter. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong, with €3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents,
                                        restricted cash and short term investments. At the end of Q1, our workforce consisted of 9,646 FTEs globally.

Revenue
Consistent Premium growth, led by subscribers
Premium Revenue grew 14% Y/Y to €2,713 million (or 13% Y/Y constant
currency, comparable to Q4’22 performance), reflecting subscriber
growth of 15% Y/Y and Premium ARPU¹ decline of 1% Y/Y to €4.32 (or
down 2% constant currency). Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU
performance was slightly impacted by product and market mix.


Broad based Ad-Supported growth
Ad-Supported revenue grew 17% Y/Y with double-digit Y/Y growth
across nearly all regions. Music advertising revenue grew low
double-digits Y/Y, reflecting double-digit Y/Y growth in impressions sold,
partially offset by softer pricing due to the current macroeconomic
environment. Podcast revenue grew nearly 20% Y/Y, driven by Original
and Exclusive podcasts where sold impressions grew strong
double-digits and CPMs increased high single-digits. The Spotify
Audience Network saw double digit Q/Q growth in participating
publishers and shows.

Operating Expenses
Primarily driven by residual headcount growth
Operating Expenses grew 36% Y/Y (or 34% constant
currency), driven primarily by higher personnel costs related to
the headcount expansion we undertook over the course of
2022. This was partially offset by lower marketing and legal
costs in the quarter, as well as the beginnings of select
efficiency initiatives. Operating Expense growth was also
impacted by severance charges of €41 million (~600 bps Y/Y)
and Y/Y changes in Social Charge movements of €68 million
(1,200 bps Y/Y).

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based
compensation of €12 million in the current period vs. (€56)
million in the prior year period.

Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate a meaningful
improvement in our Operating Expense ratios and Operating
Income/(Loss) in 2023 and beyond.


                                                                      11
Free Cash Flow
Building and sustaining a strong balance sheet

Free Cash Flow was €57 million in Q1, an increase Y/Y
as higher Operating Loss was more than offset by
favorable movements in net working capital and higher
interest income. Additionally, capital expenditures
declined €8 million Y/Y to €2 million as a result of the
completion of office build-outs.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing,
we have averaged over €200 million of positive Free
Cash Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past three
years. On a cumulative basis, we have generated €1.4
billion of Free Cash Flow since Q1’16, supporting our
strong balance sheet and €3.5 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments
balance.

Monthly Active
Users (MAUs)
Total MAUs grew 22% Y/Y to 515 million, up from 489 million
last quarter and above our guidance by 15 million. Quarterly
performance versus our guidance was impacted by:

  ●     Outperformance across all regions driven by
        reactivations and a Q/Q decrease in Ad-Supported
        MAU churn

  ●     Record Q1 net additions in nearly all age
        demographics across both developed and developing

  ●     Outperformance across all regions, led by
        Europe and Latin America

  ●     Higher top-of-funnel growth driving increased
        subscribers

  ●     Regional campaign outperformance and

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect,
Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, Sales and marketing expense excluding foreign
exchange effect, Research and development expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and General and administrative expense excluding foreign exchange effect are useful to investors because they present measures
that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Operating expense,
Sales and marketing expense, Research and development expense, and General and administrative expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is
useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude certain
infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important

emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to be profitable or generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis; our
ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid emerging industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to generate revenues from
podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the “Service”); risks relating to
acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are concentrated and can
unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes; the limitations on our
operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order to obtain licenses or
comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the dependence of streaming on
operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology structure and systems or the security of confidential
information; undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities in our products; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us;
risks relating to privacy and data security; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment-related risks; our
dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees; our ability to access to additional capital to support growth; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and interest rates, financial market volatility resulting from recent bank
failures, the continued conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to manage and remediate attempts to manipulate
streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; fluctuation of our operating results and
