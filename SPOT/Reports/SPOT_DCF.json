      "Profitability inflection in 2024 is real (€2.3B FCF, 8.7% operating margin) but sustainability depends on music label negotiations and competitive dynamics",
      "Entry price analysis shows $192 would provide 15% CAGR to base case terminal value - current price embeds significant optimism",
      "Bull case requires gross margins expanding to 35%+ and FCF margins reaching 20% - achievable but dependent on execution",
      "Bear case risk is labels demanding higher royalties or Apple/Amazon intensifying competition, returning Spotify to low/no profitability",
      "Net cash position of €3.7B provides downside protection and enables capital returns (already $410M buyback in 2025)",
