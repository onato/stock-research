  "analyst_notes": {
    "valuation_approach": "Infratil is an infrastructure investment holding company, not an operating business. Traditional DCF is challenging due to: (1) Volatile net income from portfolio revaluations, (2) No traditional revenue/operating margins, (3) Value primarily from portfolio NAV appreciation and distributions. This DCF uses normalized FCF based on proportionate EBITDAF trends and historical distribution capacity.",

    "key_considerations": [
      "CDC concentration (41% of portfolio) drives much of the growth outlook - bull/bear cases heavily dependent on data centre demand trajectory",
      "Current price NZ$11.03 is below analyst consensus NZ$13.58, suggesting market pricing in execution risks or CDC valuation concerns",
      "Historical 10-year TSR of 17% p.a. vs 11-15% target demonstrates value creation track record, supporting higher probability weight to base/bull cases",
      "NZ$1bn divestment program (58% complete) should improve portfolio quality and provide dry powder for opportunistic investments",
      "Interest rate sensitivity is high - WACC assumptions critical. Using 10.5% base (infrastructure typical 9-11% range, but Infratil has execution risk premium)"
    ],

    "growth_rate_justification": "Base case 18-10% declining growth over 5 years reflects: (1) CDC targeting to double FY25 EBITDAF by FY27 (implies ~40% CAGR near-term), (2) Longroad scaling from 3.5GW to 10GW by 2028, (3) Contact-Manawa merger synergies, (4) Offset by One NZ maturity and NZ economic headwinds, (5) Deceleration toward terminal as high-growth projects mature.",

    "wacc_calculation": "Base WACC 10.5% = Risk-free rate 4.5% (NZ 10-year govt bond) + Beta 1.2 (infrastructure with growth premium) × Equity risk premium 5% + Small cap premium 0.5%. Bull case 9.5% assumes de-risking as CDC/Longroad deliver. Bear case 12% reflects elevated interest rates and execution risk premium.",

    "terminal_growth_justification": "3% terminal growth aligns with long-term GDP growth for diversified NZ/Australia/US portfolio. Infrastructure assets should grow with nominal GDP. Below historical given mature portfolio mix in terminal year.",

    "recommendation": "Fair Value NZ$10.33 (base case) implies limited upside from current NZ$11.03, but probability-weighted IV of NZ$11.10 suggests Hold. Stock is fairly valued for balanced bull/bear risk. Entry price NZ$7.81 would provide attractive 15% CAGR to terminal. Monitor: (1) CDC contract announcements, (2) Divestment execution, (3) NZ economic recovery, (4) Interest rate trajectory."
