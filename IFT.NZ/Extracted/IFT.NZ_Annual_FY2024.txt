Transparent and reliable
Management Team

Infratil’s management team is comprised of individuals employed by Morrison
(including the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer), as well as
personnel from Infratil’s portfolio companies.
The day-to-day management of the Company has been entrusted to Morrison
through a management agreement, which sets out Morrison’s duties, powers,
and the management fee payable for its services.
The Board determines and agrees with Morrison specific goals and objectives,
with a view to achieving the strategic goals of Infratil. Morrison is held
accountable to the Board for achieving these strategic objectives.
Morrison, a specialised infrastructure investment manager with a global
presence, also oversees investments on behalf of other clients, such as the
New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Commonwealth Superannuation
Corporation, and the Australian Future Fund, some of which are partners with
Infratil in various investments.
Infratil benefits from the extensive expertise and broader network that the
Morrison management team brings to the table, surpassing what a company
of Infratil’s size could typically maintain internally. This enables Infratil to
leverage a wealth of experience and global relationships for its advantage.

Infratil's portfolio is dynamic and constantly evolving. As a result, the
composition of an investor's share today may differ significantly from
when it was initially purchased. This fluidity is why maintaining an ongoing
dialogue with shareholders is helpful.
A decade ago, 89% of Infratil's portfolio was invested in New Zealand;
today, 41% is invested domestically. Similarly, our investments in Digital
Infrastructure have seen dramatic growth – from just 0.1% of the portfolio
ten years ago to 62% today. These changes reflect our ongoing strategy to
expand our investment footprint and diversify geographically. Our consistent
stakeholder engagement plays a key role in keeping our shareholders
informed and engaged as our business continues to evolve.

Investment thesis
The rapid increase in data consumption, the proliferation of connected
devices, and the widespread adoption of cloud-based services have
made digital infrastructure a fundamental pillar of the global economy.
This infrastructure supports a vast array of applications that are integral
to daily life and business operations, from high-speed communication
networks to complex data analysis systems.
The demand for secure digital infrastructure continues to grow at an
unprecedented pace, driven by technological advancements such as
artificial intelligence and automation. These innovations are fostering
a dynamic digital ecosystem that includes fibre networks, wireless
technology, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, and data centres.
This thriving ecosystem not only supports the growing needs of
businesses and individuals but will also facilitate further technological
advancement.

30 years of growth
Thirty years ago, fewer than 10 million people worldwide had access to
the internet. Fast forward to today, and around 5.4 billion people have
gone online in the last three months, representing approximately 67%          5.4 Billion
of the global population.                                                     People connected to

Although data on the volume of information transferred via the internet
in 1994 is scarce, the growth in data creation is staggering. It's now
estimated that 120 zettabytes of data are produced annually. This
represents a remarkable 60-fold increase from the 2 zettabytes
generated in 2010. Incredibly, experts believe that 90% of all data in
existence was created in the last two years alone.

unprecedented rate. Facilities considered large
12-24 months ago are now overshadowed by the
development of 200MW+ campuses, which are
quickly becoming the new standard.
The rise of artificial intelligence (‘AI’) is driving this change, impacting not
only the data centre landscape, but also influencing daily life and business
operations. As a result, data centres are becoming even more crucial for
providing secure information storage and the high-speed connectivity
needed in our digital age.
During the 2024 financial year, CDC continued to reinforce its position as the
pre-eminent owner, operator and developer of highly secure, sovereign and
connected large-scale data centres across Australia and New Zealand. In
addition to responding to the significant acceleration in demand for data centre
capacity, CDC continued to deliver critical digital infrastructure to meet the
highest needs of its hyperscale, government and enterprise customer base.
Performance highlights include delivering a record 200MW in new contracted
capacity (includes reservations and rights of first refusal), its largest ever
addition in 12 months; a significant acceleration in construction and
development activity across all regions; the integration and expansion of
the CDC Academy, and a strong focus on the Company’s ESG and energy
initiatives. Despite the cost pressures of an inflationary environment, CDC
has also achieved 25%+ earnings growth over the period.

     While the adoption of cloud computing and SaaS
     initially drove structural changes in data centre
     demand, the rapid adoption of AI is emerging as an
     inflection point to supercharge further growth.

One New Zealand serves two million mobile and close
to four hundred thousand broadband connections with
a network of 58 consumer retail stores. In addition to
consumer services, it provides fixed-line and ICT services
to more than 110,000 corporate, government, and
small-to-medium businesses.
These customers are served by a passionate team, achieving international
top-quartile scores for both capability and culture, backed by an experienced
and highly skilled management team.

     In its first year as One NZ and under full Infratil
     ownership, the company underwent significant
     transformation, simplifying products and services,
     enhancing network infrastructure across the country,
     establishing its new brand in the market, and
     achieving substantial labour efficiencies.
This transformation resulted in a leaner and more efficient workforce, poised
to deliver against key market priorities as it enters FY2025. The company's
rationalisation efforts involved streamlining processes, reducing organisational
layers and hierarchy, centralising functions to eliminate duplication, and
outsourcing some back-office operations.
One year after its launch, the One NZ brand has been well received by customers,
with key success metrics surpassing those of the previous 'Vodafone
New Zealand' brand. Metrics such as brand awareness and non-customer
consideration are tracking ahead of expectations, indicating strong public
reception and confidence in the rebranding strategy.

operating portfolio of assets and achieving run-rate
operating company EBITDA of US$600 million by
2027. In the current year this has seen the business
add over 1GW of capacity to its operating and under-
construction fleet.
The thesis for Longroad’s strategic shift towards the accumulation of operating
assets and building scale continues to hold. Benefits include improved
purchasing power and capacity for solar panels, battery cells, and other long
lead time items such as main power transformers; the ability to originate and
maintain a larger development pipeline, which provides valuable optionality;
the ability to execute on attractive acquisition opportunities, strategically
supplementing its portfolio; and an enhanced ability to raise financing on
favourable terms, such as the US$600 million debt facility it raised this year
that will be used to further expand Longroad’s asset base.
Leveraging its strong relationships with tier 1 contractors, Longroad is
executing the largest construction programme in the company’s history, with
2.4GW of assets under construction during the year across nine projects and
five States. Longroad achieved commercial operation on 515MW of projects
and completed restoration works at Prospero 1 and Prospero 2 following the
damage caused by hail events in Texas during 2022.
Longroad also achieved financial close and began construction on two of
its largest projects ever – Sun Streams 4, a 377MW solar and 300MW/
1200MWh storage project located in Maricopa County, Arizona; and Serrano,
a 220MW solar and 214MW/855MWh storage project in Pinal and Pimal
Counties, Arizona. These two projects are estimated to produce enough
energy to power over 180,000 North American homes, with their outputs

Healthcare is a critical service globally, and diagnostic imaging
is playing an increasingly important role in preventative care.
Enabling early diagnosis reduces the dependence on expensive
acute care, leading to a more efficient healthcare system. This
shift towards value-based care benefits both patients and
healthcare providers by improving health outcomes while                                 Ultrasound
simultaneously lowering overall costs.                                                  987,133%
The demand for diagnostic imaging is also being driven by
demographic changes, particularly as the population ages.
This underscores the growing need for early detection and
preventative healthcare, reinforcing the importance of
diagnostic imaging as an idea that matters.

Over the past 30 years, the proportion of Australians aged
65 and older has risen from 11.8% to 16.6%, representing

demand for age-specific services.
During the same period, the annual number of medical imaging
scans has soared from fewer than 10 million in 1994, primarily
x-rays, to over 30 million last year. While traditional forms of
imaging have remained relatively stable, much of this growth
has come from increased use of ultrasound, and more recently,                                                                                   1994

care. This trend underscores the changing landscape of
healthcare, with greater emphasis on early diagnosis and
proactive management of health conditions.

With Covid disruptions, lockdowns, and mandatory
isolation periods now largely behind us, New Zealand’s
healthcare system and referral pathways are showing
clear signs of recovery. Supported by strong industry
fundamentals and new clinic openings, RHCNZ has
delivered a strong financial result for the year with
underlying scan volumes up 3.7% to over 1 million, and
revenue up 10.4% to $340.6 million.
One of the Group’s key strategic priorities is being the first choice for referrers
and patients and enhancing medical imaging access to all New Zealanders.
RHCNZ’s commitment to this strategy was enhanced further during the year
as a result of ongoing geographic expansion - with new clinics opening in
Papamoa, offering both high-tech (MRI and CT) and low-tech modalities
(X-ray and ultrasound); and Whangarei, offering a full suite of modalities; and
with expansions to existing services in Invercargill and Paraparaumu to add
new state-of-the-art high-tech machines and modalities.
The new Whangarei clinic (ARG Te Tai Tokerau Radiology) was officially opened
by Hon. Dr Shane Reti, Minister of Health in March and is notable for
introducing the first provincial PET-CT machine in New Zealand, revolutionising
cancer diagnosis and therapeutics access for Northland communities and
saving patients from having to travel to Auckland to receive this essential
service. In addition to the added convenience for patients, they will also have
the benefit of lower wait-times for scans and faster diagnostic results, which in
turn helps their leading care specialist to provide more timely and accurate
treatment plans.
With the new clinic additions and expansions, RHCNZ now has a presence
across the entire length of the country. Under three well-recognised brands –
Auckland Radiology, Bay Radiology, and Pacific Radiology – the Group
operates with a network of 72 clinics, a specialist team of 163 radiologists,         ARG Te Tai Tokerau Radiology,

by a focus on operational efficiencies and
technological initiatives, and aided by a continued
recovery in radiology market growth. Key strategic
priorities introduced throughout the year have put
Qscan on a stronger operational footing than it was
12 months ago.
Qscan has continued to deliver exceptional services to patients and referrers
across Australia. It’s comprehensive suite of diagnostic imaging and
interventional practices are offered through its expanding network of 77
clinics, 135 radiologists and over 1,357 employees. It has a diversified cohort
of radiologists with a reputation for clinical excellence and deep sub-specialty
expertise and utilises the latest information technology and state of the art
medical imaging equipment.
As well as the appointment of Dr Gary Shepherd as Qscan’s CEO in 2023,
(previously Qscan’s Chief Medical Officer), key initiatives throughout the year
included the introduction of a locally led, centrally supported organisational
structure. Under this structure Qscan regionalises responsibility for driving
operating performance to the local level. This included the appointment of
regional managing radiologists, regional operations managers and the
development of detailed training guides and performance scorecards to
monitor lead indicators of operational performance in each region. Another
initiative included the establishment and initial rollout of a new Practitioner
contract for engaging radiologists, ensuring incentives of doctors,
management and shareholders are closely aligned.

RetireAustralia had a record year in FY2024 with
408 resale settlements generating cash flows of
A$78 million combined with 146 new unit settlements,
with first sale proceeds of A$124 million.
The average resale value per unit increased to $191k compared to $154k in
the prior year. This increase was reflective of a measured approach to price
increases since FY2021, as well as benefiting from a positive location-based
mix of units available to settle. This unit pricing growth is expected to continue
into FY2025.
Strong demand is being experienced across the portfolio with waitlists in
place for 24 of 29 villages and occupancy remaining high at 96.6%, compared
to the industry benchmark of 89%.
Importantly, resident and home care customer satisfaction was extremely
positive with 85% of residents saying they are satisfied or very satisfied with
life in their village and 86% of home care customers saying they are satisfied
or very satisfied with the Home Care Services they receive from
RetireAustralia. Employee satisfaction remained stable and positive with
81% of employees saying they were satisfied or very satisfied with working
at RetireAustralia. The strong satisfaction results are indicative of the
shared vision and purpose, depth of expertise and resilience within the
RetireAustralia team.
As a human services business, RetireAustralia firmly believes that a strong
corporate culture and resident experience go hand in hand with financial
excellence.

     These sustained positive results are borne out
     of a deliberate approach to building culture and
     putting residents at the heart of decision

Investment thesis
Airports play a critical role in global transportation, serving as gateways
for travel, trade, and economic activity. Demand for air travel is driven
by a range of factors such as population growth, rising disposable
incomes, globalisation, and the increasing integration of international
markets.
As economies continue to expand, airports are uniquely positioned to          7 Million

30 years of growth
Over the past 30 years, Wellington Airport's passenger numbers have
steadily risen, largely in step with GDP growth, as economic expansion
has driven increased demand for air travel. However, like many other
industries, the aviation sector faced an unprecedented shock due to
Covid-19, which eclipsed earlier disruptions like the 9/11 terrorist          5 Million
attacks, the 2008 global financial crisis, or the 2002 SARS outbreak in
terms of severity and impact.

Wellington Airport experienced a year of robust
growth and sustained recovery, with passenger
numbers recovering well and earnings surpassing
pre-Covid levels.
Over the year the airport hosted 5.5 million passengers, nearly 200,000
more than the previous year. This rebound reflects a broader trend of
renewed interest in travel and a signal that the aviation industry is steadily
moving beyond the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This
momentum has also translated into a significant increase in earnings, with
EBITDAF reaching $107.1 million, a 19.5% increase from the previous year
($89.6 million) and back above pre-Covid levels (FY2020: $103.2 million).

     One of the key drivers of growth has been the
     resurgence in international travel, with passenger
     numbers increasing by 31% year-on-year.
All pre-Covid route pairs have been restored, with domestic passenger numbers
at 90% of pre-Covid levels and international numbers at 80%. These figures are
particularly encouraging, given the headwinds of high airfares, a slowing
economy, and airline capacity constraints, in particular the Pratt and Whitney
engine maintenance issues affecting Air New Zealand’s A320/A321 fleet.
Qantas has emerged as Wellington's largest international airline, with a
significant expansion in operations. The introduction of the Wellington-Brisbane
route in October 2023 has been a success, prompting Qantas to upgrade to a
larger B738 aircraft for the 2024/25 summer season. By the end of 2024,
Qantas will offer 40% more seats than before the pandemic. Other airlines, such
as Fiji Airways and Jetstar, have also expanded their seat offerings, with 81%
more and 13% more seats flown, respectively, compared to pre-Covid levels.
The 2040 Masterplan continues to be the blueprint for the future development
required to meet the expected increase in travel demand. The Airport's strategic

     (6.4) Longroad Energy
     Longroad Energy Holdings, LLC ('Longroad Energy'), is a Boston, MA, headquartered renewable energy developer focused on the development,
     ownership, and operation of utility-scale wind and solar energy projects throughout North America. Infratil holds a 36.95% (2023: 37.05%)
     shareholding in Longroad Energy, alongside investment partners the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (36.95%), MEAG (11.25%) and Longroad
     Energy management (14.85%).
     In the prior year, Infratil, together with its co-investors the NZ Super Fund and the Longroad Energy management team, announced that MEAG, acting
     as the asset management arm for entities of Munich Re, had agreed to invest US$300 million to acquire a 12.0% stake in Longroad Energy.
     Immediately prior to completion of the transaction both Infratil and the NZ Super Fund each contributed US$85.0 million to Longroad Energy which
     resulted in US$20.2 million being recognised as goodwill. Following the transaction, Infratil and the NZ Super Fund each retained a 37.0% stake in
     Longroad Energy. As part of the transaction both Infratil and the NZ Super Fund also agreed to invest a further US$100 million, which will be used to
     fund Longroad Energy’s near-term development pipeline.
     With MEAG entering as a co-investor (12.0%) but contributing 40% of the US$500 million capital commitment, if this capital commitment was called
     upfront on day one, Infratil would have recognised an upfront gain on sale on the sale of an interest to MEAG of US$72.9 million. However, the gain on
     sale is dependent on the net assets of Longroad at the time the commitment is called. During the year, US$38.3 million was recognised as a gain on
     sale on the transaction (31 March 2023: US$39.5 million). The committment was fully utilised during the year.

     (6.5) Kao Data
     Kao Data is an owner, operator and developer of data centres in the United Kingdom. Infratil holds a 52.9% (31 March 2023: 39.9%) shareholding
     in Kao Data, alongside Legal & General Group 32.1% and Goldacre 14.9%.
     On 22 September 2023, Infratil completed the acquisition of an additional 12.9% of Kao Data from Goldacre for cash consideration of £39.9 million,
     increasing Infratil's shareholding to 52.9%.
     Management have considered if they control Kao Data given the 52.9% shareholding. Based on the operational structure of Kao Data the Group does not
     control Kao Data under under IFRS 10 therefore will continue to equity-account for the investment given the assessment of significant influence is met.

Clearvision Ventures
In February 2016 Infratil made an initial commitment of US$25 million to the California based Clearvision Ventures. Further commitments of
US$25 million and US$50 million were made in May 2020 and May 2022 respectively bringing Infratil's total commitments to US$100 million.
The strategic objective of the investment is to help Infratil's businesses identify and engage with technology changes that will impact their activities.
As at 31 March 2024, Infratil has made total contributions of US$57.9million (31 March 2023: US$46.4 million), with the remaining US$42.1 million
commitment uncalled at that date.

(8) Acquisition of subsidiaries
(8.1) One NZ
On 7 June 2023, Infratil announced that it had reached an agreement with Brookfield Asset Management (‘Brookfield’), to acquire Brookfield’s 49.95%
stake in ICN JV Investments Limited (‘One NZ’) for $1,800.0 million, increasing Infratil’s ownership from 49.95% to 99.90%. The $1,800.0 million was
paid in cash and was allocated as $1,572.1 million consideration for the shares, and $227.9 million for Brookfield’s portion of the shareholder loan
receivable. The transaction completed on 15 June 2023, funded by existing cash reserves, external debt funding, and an equity raise.
Prior to 15 June 2023, Infratil’s investment in One NZ was equity accounted under NZ IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. This was
on the basis that Infratil and Brookfield collectively controlled One NZ. As a result of Infratil's increased ownership, Infratil is required to consolidated
One NZ from the acquisition date. As Infratil's original stake in One NZ was acquired in May 2019, NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the
acquisition of Brookfield's 49.95% stake is recognised as an acquisition achieved in stages ('step acquisition').
In a step acquisition, the fair value of the equity accounted investment in One NZ that Infratil held immediately before obtaining control is used in the
determination of goodwill that will be recognised by Infratil on acquisition of the controlling share in One NZ. This treatment effectively considers that
the 49.95% of the investment in One NZ that was held by Infratil, before obtaining control, is sold, and a 99.90% controlling interest in a subsidiary has
been purchased. The fair value of the initial 49.95% has been calculated as $1,235.3 million by discounting the price paid for the controlling interest
with observed market control premiums. As of 14 June 2023, the carrying value of Infratil’s investment in One NZ was $170.8 million. Comparing the
carrying value of Infratil’s investment immediately before obtaining control to the fair value results in a gain on acquisition of $1,064.5 million.
NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination are measured at fair
value at the date of acquisition, with any deficit between the consideration paid (including the previously held equity investment at fair value) and the
value of the net identifiable assets (or liabilities) acquired and any non-controlling interest, recognised as goodwill, with any gain recognised through
profit & loss. An independent valuer was appointed to perform this exercise. The key inputs and assumptions that are used in measuring the fair value
of material tangible assets include replacement values, historical costs, life assumptions and terminal values for each asset. For material customer
relationships and contract intangible asset, the key inputs and assumptions used for measuring the fair value include projections of future profitability
of customers, expected average customer tenure, contributory asset charges, and application of discount and tax rates. In measuring the fair value of
the One NZ trade name, the key inputs and assumptions include the historical costs incurred and the expected useful life.
For the 10 months ended 31 March 2024, One NZ contributed revenue of $1,681.6 millon and a loss of $83.3 million to the Group's result, which
includes acquisition-related costs of $1.0 million. If the acquisition had occured on 1 April 2023, Management estimates that consolidated revenue
and net loss after tax would have been $2,016.7 million and net loss of $99.9 million, respectively. In determining these amounts, Management has
assumed the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been materially the same if the acquisition had occured on
1 April 2023.
The acquisition accounting required under NZ IFRS 3 has been finalised at 31 March 2024. Goodwill of $2,880.4 million has been recognised based
on the carrying value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets.

     As part of the requirements under NZ IFRS 3 for a step acquisition, Infratil remeasured its previously held equity interest in One NZ to its acquisition-
     date fair value of $1,235.3 million, and the resulting gain of $1,064.5 million has been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within
     "revaluation adjustments of equity-accounted investment to fair value". Amounts previously recognised in OCI of $10.5 million were also reclassified
     to "revaluation adjustments of equity-accounted investment to fair value" as if the initial equity interest had been sold to a third party.
     Infratil's goodwill is mainly attributable to the perceived momentum and remaining upside within One NZ digital services and connectivity, the
     enhancement to Infratil's portfolio and return profile, and the material benefits associated with 99.9% ownership.
     Acquisition costs relating to the transaction of $1.0 million were recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended
     31 March 2024.

(8.2) Console Connect
On 10 July 2023, lnfratil executed a conditional agreement with Hong Kong Telecom (‘HKT’) to establish a strategic partnership to accelerate the
growth of HKT's Console Connect business. Infratil will initially acquire an 80% stake in Console Connect from HKT for US$160 million. Infratil and HKT
will also enter into a strategic partnership, with both jointly investing up to US$295 million over a 2-year period following completion of the acquisition
to accelerate Console Connect’s growth. Following this initial period of growth investment, Infratil will own between 60-80% of Console Connect, with
HKT holding the remainder.
The Group will fund the acquisition through existing bank loan facilities. Drawdown is contingent on completion of the acquisition. Completion of the
acquisition is conditional on certain telecommunication, foreign investment regulatory approvals and merger approvals. Assuming those approvals
are granted, completion is currently expected by Q3 FY2025. As such the acquisition remains incomplete at the date of signing the accounts.

(9) Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
(9.1) Trustpower Retail Business
On 21 June 2021, Trustpower announced the conditional sale of its gas, telecommunication and retail electricity supply business (excluding the supply
of electricity to commercial and industrial customers) to Mercury NZ Limited.
On 2 May 2022, Trustpower announced the conditions of the Trustpower Retail business to Mercury NZ Limited had been met and completion of
the sale occurred (effective as of 1 May 2022). The sale price was $467.4 million including working capital adjustments. A working capital wash-up
process was then completed which resulted in Mercury NZ Limited paying an additional $2.0 million to bring the final sale proceeds to $469.4 million.
After sale costs, the net proceeds from the sale were $467.0 million, resulting in a gain on sale at the group consolidated level of $328.8 million. At
that date the company also confirmed its name change to Manawa Energy Limited.
As the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in the Trustpower Retail business has been recovered through a sale transaction, the Trustpower
Retail business was classified as a discontinued operation at 31 March 2023. A detailed note disclosure is included in the published financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2023.

(9.2) Infratil Infrastructure Property Limited
In June 2022, the Infratil Infrastructure Property Limited ('IIPL') Board approved the marketing of IIPL's investment property at 100 Halsey Street
('Wynyard 100') for a potential sale. The sales process remains ongoing at 31 March 2024. As such, the investment property at 100 Halsey Street is
deemed to be held for sale at 31 March 2024. Included in assets and liabilities held for sale are investment property ($94.0 million), right of use assets
($70.3 million) and lease liabilities ($69.3 million).
At 31 March 2024, the investment property at 100 Halsey Street is not deemed to be a discontinued operation as it does not represent a separate
major line of business or geographic area of operation for the Group.

The Group operates in various jurisdictions some of which have enacted or substantively enacted tax legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model
Rules. However, as the application of the Pillar Two Model Rules in respect of those jurisdictions will not apply to the financial reporting period ended
31 March 2024, there is no current tax impact in the year ended 31 March 2024. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred
tax accounting in respect of the Pillar Two Model Rules and will account for it as a current tax arising under the Pillar Tax Model rules when it is incurred.
Under Pillar Two legislation, the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax if the effective tax rate ('ETR') per jurisdiction is below the 15% minimum rate. Infratil
is in the process of assessing its exposure to the Pillar Two legislation for when it comes into effect. This assessment indicates that, no top-up tax would
have arisen for the Group’s operations during the period.

The Infratil New Zealand Group is forecasting to derive taxable profits in future periods, sufficient to utilise the tax losses carried forward and
deductible temporary differences. As a result deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised where they arise, including deferred tax on
tax losses carried forward.
On 28 March 2024, the New Zealand Government enacted the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Act.
As a result, from the 2024-25 income tax year onwards, the Group can no longer claim any tax depreciation on all of its commercial buildings with
estimated useful lives of 50 years or more in New Zealand. The claim of tax depreciation of building fit-out separate from the related building
structures will not be affected. The Group has assessed the impact and this has resulted in an increase to deferred tax expense and deferred tax
liability of $50.3 million.

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, or at fair value less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.
Fair value is determined by an independent valuer or by management with reference to independent experts, using recognised valuation
techniques. An independent valuer is engaged to provide a valuation if management does not have sufficient expertise to perform the valuation.
These valuations are undertaken on a systematic basis at least every five years. In years where a valuation is not undertaken, a material change
assessment of each asset class is performed to assess whether carrying amounts differ materially from fair value. This assessment is undertaken
with assistance from independent experts and includes reference to projections of future revenues, volumes, operational and capital expenditure
profiles, capacity, terminal values, the application of discount rates and replacement values (as relevant to each class of asset) as an indicator of
a possible material change in fair value. Where a material change in fair value is identified, the carrying value is adjusted to bring carrying value
materially in line with fair value.
There were no independent external valuations of property, plant and equipment performed as at 31 March 2024.
As at 31 March 2024 a material change assessment was performed for each asset class recorded at fair value less accumulated depreciation
where no external valuation was undertaken. A summary of the fair value consideration is provided below.
Manawa Energy's Renewable Generation Assets
Manawa Energy's renewable generation assets are measured at fair value and are revalued by Independent external valuers, every three years or
more frequently if there is a significant change in value.
Manawa Energy's renewable generation assets include land and buildings which are not separately identifiable from other generation assets.
Renewable generation assets were last independently revalued, using a discounted cash flow methodology, as at 31 March 2023, to their estimated
market value as assessed by Deloitte Corporate Finance. Based on the Group’s assessment there was no material change identified in the carrying
value of Manawa Energy’s generation assets at 31 March 2024.
The valuation of Manawa Energy’s renewable generation assets are sensitive to the inputs used in the discounted cash flow valuation model.
A sensitivity analysis of key inputs is given in the table below. The overall valuation has been determined to be between $1,663.9 million to
$1,952.4 million and, while the mid-point has been selected for revaluation purposes, any value within this range would be considered appropriate.
The sensitivities around weighted average cost of capital have been used to create this overall range.
The following table summarises the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuer to arrive at fair value at the date of
the last external valuation.

Wellington International Airport's property, plant and equipment
Wellington Airport's Land, Civil Assets and Buildings are measured at fair value.

Land
The Group's assessment of WIAL’s land indicated a material change in value with reference to New Zealand and Wellington house price indices
published by Real Estate of New Zealand, changes in commercial and industrial property values and consideration of other key inputs. Using the last
independent external valuation performed for the year ended 31 March 2023 as a base, further work was performed to estimate fair value including
an assessment of key inputs into land value. An increase in MVAU rate per hectare to $2.86 million (2023: $2.74 million) was adopted and was based
on increases across residential, commercial and industrial property. There has been no change to other key inputs from the prior year. Airport
developers WACC has been held at 12.2%. Based on this, a fair value increase of $25.5 million (2023: $74.1 million) has been made to the carrying
value of land and recognised in the Asset Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income.					

Civil Assets
At 31 March 2024, a material change assessment was performed for Civil asset class given no independent external valuation was undertaken.
Based on the Group's assessment which includes reference to the Waka Kotahi Construction index and the Producers Price index, and assisted by
WSP Opus International Consultants Limited, a fair value increase of $9.1 million has been made to the carrying value of these assets in the Asset
Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income (2023: $16.9 million).
Buildings
The Buildings asset class is comprised of three main sub-components; (a) Specialised buildings, (b) Vehicle business assets and (c) Hotel
business assets.

      (a) Specialised buildings
      Based on the Group's assessment which includes reference to the capital goods price index and consumer price index, a fair value increase
      of $12.6 million has been made to the carrying value of these assets in the Asset Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income
      (2023: $29.4 million).

      (b) Vehicle business assets
      Based on the Group's assessment which includes reference to passenger forecasts and discounted cash flow modelling, a fair value increase
      of $20.0 million has been made to the carrying value of these assets in the Asset Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income
      (2023: $2.7 million).

      (c) Hotel business assets
      Based on the Group's assessment which includes reference to passenger forecasts and discounted cash flow modelling, a fair value increase
      of $3.6 million has been made to the carrying value of these assets in the Asset Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income
      (2023: $8.1 million).
      The following table summarises the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuers to arrive at fair value at the date
      of the last independent external valuation. Where there have been fair value adjustments in the year ended 31 March 2024, further detail has been
      provided under the respective asset classes below.

      The fair value of investment properties at Wellington International Airport and Infratil Infrastructure Property are estimated each year by an
      independent valuer, Jones Lang LaSalle, which reflects market conditions at balance date. Changes to market conditions or to assumptions made in
      the estimation of fair value will result in changes to the fair value of the investment properties.
      The valuation of Wellington International Airport's investment properties is based on a discounted cash flow and capitalisation rate approach. The fair
      value at 31 March 2024 is $90.5 million (2023: $97.0 million).
      The valuation of Infratil Infrastructure Property's investment properties is based on a capitalisation of net income, forecast EBITDA and discounted
      cashflow approach. The fair value at 31 March 2024 is $94.0 million (2023: $99.2 million). There were no capital works in progress included in
      investment properties at 31 March 2024 (2023: none). Infratil Infrastructure Property investment property's assets and liabilities are classified as held
      for sale at 31 March 2024.
      Where a lease pertains to property held to earn rental income, the right of use asset is included within Investment properties and is measured at fair
      value. Rental income from investment properties of $15.8 million was recognised in profit or loss during the year (2023: $14.2 million). Direct
      operating expenses arising from investment properties of $4.6 million were also recognised in profit or loss during the year (2023: $2.7 million).

      The goodwill arising on Infratil's acquisition of an additional 49.95% stake in One NZ during the current year is outlined in note 8.1.
      The carrying value of Goodwill is allocated across the five subsidiaries and is subject to an annual impairment at the Cash Generating Unit ('CGU')
      level to ensure the carrying value does not exceed the recoverable amount at balance date. This is outlined below for each company.

      Manawa Energy
      Cash Generating Units and Impairment testing
      The CGU is the operating segment of Manawa for impairment testing within the Group. In determining whether an impairment is necessary, the fair
      value of the Company's investment in Manawa is assessed with reference to the market share price quoted on the NZX at each reporting date.

      Qscan Group
      Cash Generating Units
      Qscan goodwill is allocated across six CGUs being, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia ('QTWA'), Northern New South Wales ('NNSW'),
      Australian Capital Territory ('ACT'), Southern New South Wales ('SNSW'), Regional, Western Australia, ('WA').
      Impairment testing
      Goodwill assets were tested for impairment at 31 March 2024. The test involved calculating the recoverable value of the assets to ensure that it
      exceeded their carrying value.
      The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been calculated using the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal ('FVLCOD') approach on a discounted cash flow
      model. The recoverable amount of a CGU is defined as higher of FVLCOD and its value in use (’VIU’). Qscan’s VIU is less than its FVLCOD.
      The future cash flows were discounted using a post-tax weighted cost of capital ('WACC') for the Qscan Group of 10.93% (31 March 2023: 10.38%).
      The cash flow forecasts cover a period of 5 years with a terminal growth rate thereafter. The terminal growth rate, being 3% (31 March 2023: 3%), was
      determined based on management's estimate of the long-term annual EBITDA growth rate for the Qscan Group and assume continuation of stable
      growth in healthcare services in Australia.
      The cashflow forecasts are initially based on the FY2025 Board approved budget, with forecasts beyond year one taking into consideration:
      • Historical revenue growth and EBITDA margins achieved by each CGU as well as the trends within the Australian medical imaging industry, including
        the recovery in demand following the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic;
      • Estimated cashflows related to new clinic growth including capital expenditure to support these activities; and
      • Estimated cash flows related to Information Technology projects to support future growth in revenue and EBITDA margins.
      The recoverable value calculations have been assessed for sensitivity in the earnings margins as a key input to reflect the macroeconomic and
      inflationary conditions in the market. Based on the sensitivity assessment performed, the estimated recoverable amount of three of the six CGUs fell
      below its carrying amount by approximately $61.9 million (31 March 2023: nil). As a result, Qscan recognised a $61.9 million (A$57.4 million)
      impairment expense which is presented in net realisations, revaluations and impairments in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The impairment
      loss was fully allocated to goodwill.




106
The impairment loss is based on the downside scenario that assumes EBITDA margin growth is not fully realised (EBITDA margins sensitised to be
between ~1-2% growth on historically observed margins) and that the anticipated revenue growth is achieved more so through volume (rather than
yield), putting pressure on Qscan’s ability to grow clinic margins.

RHCNZ Medical Imaging
Cash Generating Units
Goodwill is allocated to the operating entities within RHCNZ of Pacific Radiology ('PRG'), Auckland Radiology ('ARG'), and Bay Radiology ('BRL').
Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been calculated based on a value in use model using an internal discounted cash flow valuation model.
The future cash flows were discounted using a post-tax WACC for the RHCNZ Group of 9.8% (31 March 2023: 10.1%), with a CGU risk specific equity
premium applied to ARG and BRL.
The cash flows in the model cover a period of 10 years with a terminal growth rate of 3.5% thereafter. The cash flows are initially based on the FY2025
Board approved budget and Board approved long-term key assumptions, noting cash flows are based on a pure value in use basis and exclude
greenfield growth opportunities that were included in the budget. Forecasts beyond year one taking into the following key inputs and assumptions:
long-term industry growth (aligning with independent market research and global trends), patient volume growth, operating costs (specifically staff),
and machinery and facility utilisation.
During the year, no impairment was deemed necessary across the three CGUs.

One NZ
Cash Generating Units
The CGU is the operating segment of One NZ for impairment testing within the Group.
Impairment testing
The impairment assessment has determined the recoverable amount of the CGU by assessing the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal ('FVLCOD') of the
underlying assets. During the year ending 31 March 2024 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of goodwill. No reasonably possible
changes in assumptions have been identified that would result in impairment.
The model uses cash flow projections based on 20-year management approved forecasts. The forecasts use management estimates to determine
forecast earnings, expenses and capital expenditure for the CGU based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU performance. The
major inputs and assumptions used in the model that require judgement include revenue and operating expense forecasts, customer numbers and
churn, discount rate and growth rate used. This is because cash flows from the fixed and mobile product lines or the consumer/enterprise/wholesale
customers cannot be independently identified. Strategic decision making is made at the ICN JV group level.

      Financing arrangements
      Wholly owned subsidiaries
      Infratil Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank facility arrangements with a negative pledge agreement,
      which, with limited exceptions does not permit the Infratil Guaranteeing Group (‘IGG’) to grant any security over its assets. The IGG comprises entities
      subject to a cross guarantee and comprises Infratil Limited, Infratil Finance Limited and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries. These facilities are
      primarily used to fund the corporate and investment activities of the Company. The IGG does not incorporate the underlying assets of the Company’s
      non-wholly owned subsidiaries and associates. The IGG bank facilities also include restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank
      agreement. Liability under the cross guarantee is limited to the amount of debt drawn under the IGG facilities, plus any unpaid interest and costs of
      recovery.
      At 31 March 2024 there was $811.0 million of drawn debt under the IGG facilities (31 March 2023: nil) and undrawn IGG facilities totalled
      $800.9 million (31 March 2023: $898.4 million).
      Non-wholly owned subsidiaries
      The Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries also enter into bank facility arrangements. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are included
      within loans and borrowings in the table above. Wellington International Airport and Manawa Energy’s facilities are both subject to negative pledge
      arrangements, which with limited exceptions does not permit those entities to grant security over their respective assets. One NZ, Qscan Group and
      RHCNZ Medical Imaging borrow under syndicated bank debt facilities, under which security is granted over their respective assets. All non-wholly
      owned subsidiary facilities are subject to restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement.
      The various bank facilities across the Group require the relevant borrowing group to operate within defined performance and gearing ratios as is typical
      of debt facilities of this nature. Throughout the period the Group has complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by the respective
      lenders.
      Interest rates
      Interest rates payable on bank loan facilities are floating rate determined by reference to prevailing money market rates at the time of draw-down
      plus a margin. Interest rates paid during the year ranged from 6.48% to 9.24% (31 March 2023: 1.40% to 8.44%).

      Manawa Energy's unsecured senior bonds rank equally with their bank loans. Manawa Energy borrows under a negative pledge arrangement, which
      with limited exceptions does not permit Manawa Energy to grant any security interest over its assets. The Trust Deed for these bonds requires Manawa
      Energy to maintain certain levels of shareholders' funds and operate within defined performance and debt gearing ratios. The arrangements under the
      Trust Deed may also create restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets unless the senior bonds are repaid or renegotiated. Throughout the
      year Manawa Energy complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by its bond supervisor.
      At 31 March 2024 Manawa Energy's unsecured senior bonds had a fair value of $373.5 million (31 March 2023: $364.4 million).

(22) Financial instruments
The Group has exposure to the following risks due to its business activities and financial policies:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Market risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring
and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital.

(22.1) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit
risk in the normal course of business including those arising from trade receivables with its customers, financial derivatives and transactions (including
cash balances) with financial institutions. The Group minimises its exposure to credit risk of trade receivables through the adoption of counterparty
credit limits and standard payment terms. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and
organisations in the relevant industry. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of significant counterparties are monitored, and the aggregate value
of exposures are spread across approved counterparties. The carrying amounts of financial assets recognised in the Statement of Financial Position
best represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date. Generally no security is held on these amounts.

(22.2) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that assets held by the Group cannot readily be converted to cash to meet the Group's contracted cash flow obligations.
Liquidity risk is monitored by continuously forecasting cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group's
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stress
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
sufficient cash and committed credit facilities and ensuring an appropriate spread of debt maturities and credit profile to ensure access to capital
markets as required.
The tables below analyses the Group's financial liabilities, excluding gross settled derivative financial liabilities and deferred tax, into relevant maturity
groupings based on the earliest possible contractual maturity date at year end. The amounts in the tables below are contractual undiscounted cash
flows, which include interest through to maturity. Perpetual Infratil Infrastructure Bonds cash flows have been determined by reference to the longest
dated Infratil bond maturity in the year 2030. Contractual cashflows include liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2024.

      (22.3) Market risk
      Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and energy prices will affect the Group’s income or
      the value of its holdings of financial assets and liabilities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures
      within acceptable parameters, while minimising the volatility in the Group's NZD cashflows.

      (22.3.1) Interest rate risk (cash flow and fair value)
      Interest rate risk is the risk of interest rate volatility negatively affecting the Group's interest expense cash flow and earnings. Infratil mitigates this risk
      by managing it's interest rate exposures in accordance with it's Group Treasury Policy, which sets out defined maximum and minimum hedging levels
      that are maintained as a proportion of forecast total drawn debt. Infratil achieves compliance with these thresholds by issuing fixed rate bonds or
      entering into interest rate derivatives to adjust it's fixed rate exposure profile. Borrowings issued at fixed rates does expose the Group to fair value
      interest rate risk.

      Assumptions used in the interest rate sensitivity analysis include:
      Reasonably possible movements in interest rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of 100 basis points
      higher/lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate the sensitivity of the Group to movements in interest rates. The sensitivity was calculated by
      taking interest rate instruments including loans and borrowings, bonds, interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps at balance date and
      adjusting the interest rate upwards and downwards to quantify the resulting impact to profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

(22.3.2) Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk on the value of its net investment in foreign investments, assets and liabilities, future investment
obligations and future income. Foreign currency obligations and income are recognised as soon as the flow of funds is likely to occur. Decisions on
buying forward cover for likely foreign currency investments is subject to the Group’s expectation of the fair value of the relevant exchange rate.
The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk from price fluctuations of foreign currency commitments associated with the
construction of generation assets and to hedge the risk of its net investment in foreign operations. Any resulting differential to be paid or received as a
result of the currency hedging of the asset is reflected in the final cost of the asset. The Group has elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to
these instruments.
The following table shows the impact on post-tax profit and equity if the New Zealand dollar had weakened or strengthened by 10 per cent against the
currencies with which the Group has foreign currency risk with, all other variables held constant.

Assumptions used in the foreign currency exposure sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in foreign exchange rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of plus or minus
10% has been applied to the NZD/AUD, NZD/USD, NZD/EUR and NZD/GBP exchange rates to demonstrate the sensitivity of foreign currency risk of
the company’s investment in foreign operations and associated derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity was calculated by taking each currency
pair's spot rate as at balance date, moving this spot rate by plus and minus 10% and then reconverting the foreign currency balances with the ‘new
spot-rate’.
Unhedged foreign currency exposures
At balance date the Group has the following unhedged exposure to foreign currency risk arising on foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that

      (22.3.3) Energy price risk
      Energy Price Risk is the risk that financial performance will be impacted by fluctuations in spot energy prices. The Group meets its energy sales
      demand by purchasing energy on spot markets, physical deliveries and financial derivative contracts. This exposes the Group to fluctuations in the
      spot and forward price of energy. The Group has entered into a energy hedge contract to reduce the energy price risk from price fluctuations. This
      hedge contract establishes the price at which future specified quantities of energy are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be paid or
      received is recognised as a component of energy costs through the term of the contract. The Group has elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting
      to those instruments it deems material and which qualify as a cash flow hedge.
      The electricity price contract for difference ('CFD') entered with Mercury NZ Limited was transferred at a price of $1 per the mass market retail
      business sale and purchase agreement. When valued against the wholesale electricity price curve, this derivative had a value on day 1 of negative
      $521.7 million. NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments requires that where the fair value differs to the transaction price for a Level 3 instrument, the valuation
      must be calibrated to reflect the transaction price. As a result, no day 1 fair value has been recorded. The day 1 loss of $521.7 million will be recognised
      in profit and loss as contractual cash flows on the swap are settled and fair value gains/losses on the calibrated swap are realised over time.
      During the current period, $129.7 million (cumulative to date: $251.9 million) of the deferred day 1 value has been recognised through wholesale
      electricity revenue as the calibrated CFD cash flows have been realised throughout the period. These CFD cash settlements have reduced the impact
      of changes in wholesale electricity prices on Manawa Energy's revenue. As the absolute value of the actual hedge as at 31 March 2024 is less than the
      absolute of the hypothetical, the hedge is deemed effective and any prior ineffectiveness taken to the profit and loss is reversed. On this basis a
      current period fair value loss of $69.6 million (31 March 2023 $97.3 million gain) has been recognised with $nil (31 March 2023: $27.8 million) taken
      to the cash flow hedge reserve and $69.6 million loss (31 March 2023: $69.6 million gain) taken to net fair value gains/losses on financial
      instruments. The fair value of this electricity price derivative at 31 March 2024 is a $3.7 million liability (31 March 2023: $97.4 million asset).


                                                                                                                                       2024                 2023

      Assumptions used in the energy forward price sensitivity analysis include:
      Reasonably possible movements in energy forward prices were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of 10% higher/
      lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate sensitivity to movements in forward energy prices. The sensitivity was calculated by taking balances
      that incorporate expectations of forward electricity prices at balance date and adjusting the forward electricity price upwards and downwards to
      quantify the resulting impact to profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
      If the discount rate for valuing electricity price increased/decreased by 1% then the fair value of the electricity price derivatives would have
      decreased/increased by $0.8 million (2023: $1.4 million). If the forecast inflation rate has increased/decreased by 1% then the fair value of electricity
      price derivatives would have increased/decreased by $8.3 million (2023: $16.2 million).

Estimation of fair values
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference
  to quoted market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated using market-quoted rates based on discounted cash flow analysis.
• The fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted
  cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve or available forward price data for the duration of the instruments.
Where the fair value of a derivative is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the instrument, the two key types of
variables used by the valuation techniques are:
• forward price curve (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices); and
• discount rates

      The selection of variables requires significant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions in respect of these
      variables that could be used in estimating the fair value of these derivatives. Maximum use is made of observable market data when selecting variables
      and developing assumptions for the valuation techniques.
      Fair value hierarchy
      The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
      • Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
      • Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly
        (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
      • Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3)
      The following tables present the Group's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

(22.5) Risk Management Framework
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of Infratil's risk management framework. Infratil has established an
Audit and Risk Committee's ('ARC') and a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework. The ARC's risk management responsibilities include
reviewing management practices in relation to the ongoing identification, assessment and management of risks which are grouped into principal risk
categories; portfolio, operational, stakeholder and regulatory and compliance. Particular attention is given to strategic risks that have the potential to
materially impact the overall performance of the Infratil portfolio. Infratil Management provide regular reporting to the ARC on the relevant risks and
the controls and treatments for those risks, with escalation to the Board where necessary. Through its material Board representation across each
significant subsidiary and associate, Infratil seeks to ensure that the Board and Management teams of each entity have robust governance and risk
management processes in place to effectively identify, assess and monitor the operational and strategic risks relevant to each individual business.

(22.6) Climate Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Infratil recognises the importance of assessing and mitigating climate-related risks across their portfolio companies. As a responsible investor in
infrastructure assets, Infratil acknowledges the potential impacts of climate change on its portfolio and is committed to taking proactive measures to
address these risks.
Assessment of Climate Risks
Infratil has conducted a thorough assessment of climate-related risks across its portfolio, considering both physical risks and transition risks associated
with climate change.
As of 1 April 2023, the Group is a Climate Reporting Entity for the purpose of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (‘FMCA’). On 21 December
2023, Infratil released its voluntary inaugural Climate Related Disclosures. Further information on the Group’s response to climate-related risks and
disclosures is available here https://infratil.com/for-investors/reports-results-meetings-investor-days/#sustainability-reports-page. Infratil will
release its mandatory Climate Risk Disclosure report by 31 July 2024.
The Group reviews its investments against independent external valuation reports to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. Independent external valuations also form the basis for the International Portfolio Incentive Fees paid to Morrison
annually. The valuers have considered the impact of climate change on the investments but have made no explicit adjustments in respect of climate
change matters. However, the Group and valuers anticipate that climate change could have a greater influence on valuations in the future as
investment markets place a greater emphasis on this topic.

      (22.7) Capital Management
      The Group's capital includes share capital, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests of the Group. From time to time the Group
      purchases its own shares on the market with the timing of these purchases dependent on market prices, an assessment of value for shareholders
      and an available window to trade on the NZX. Primarily the shares are intended to be held as treasury stock and may be reissued under the
      Dividend Reinvestment Plan or cancelled. During the year the Group issued 677,644 shares under the dividend reinvestment plan.
      The Group seeks to manage it's maturity concentration through the regular assessment of it's funding maturity profile and maintaining aggregate
      concentration below an acceptable limit. Discussions on refinancing of debt facilities will normally commence at least six months before maturity.
      Facilities are maintained with highly rated financial institutions, and with a minimum number of bank counterparties to ensure diversification.

      Infratil approved increases to its capital commitments to Galileo (€52.0 million) and Gurīn Energy (US$57.0 million). These will be executed after
      31 March 2024 and are therefore not included in the table above. The uncalled commitment at 31 March 2023 was $679.1 million. Infratil’s
      shareholding allows it to control the timing and quantum of any capital calls.

New Zealand Portfolio Management Fee
The New Zealand base management fee is paid on the 'New Zealand Company Value' at 0.80% per annum on the New Zealand Company Value above
$150 million, 1.00% per annum on the New Zealand Company Value between $50 million and $150 million and 1.125% per annum on New Zealand
Company value up to $50 million. The New Zealand Company Value is defined as:
• the Company's market capitalisation as defined in the Management Agreement (the aggregated market value of the Company's listed securities,
  being ordinary shares, partly paid shares and, Infratil Infrastructure bonds);
• plus the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries' net debt (excluding listed debt securities and the book value of the debt in any non-
  Australasian investments);
• minus the cost price of any non-Australasian investments; and,
• an adjustment for foreign exchange gains or losses related to non-New Zealand investments.
International Portfolio Management Fee
The international fund management fee is paid at the rate of 1.50% per annum on:
• the cost price of any non-Australasian investments; and,
• the book value of the debt in any wholly owned non-Australasian investments.
International Portfolio Incentive Fees
International Investments are eligible for International Portfolio incentive fees (‘Incentive fees’) under the Management Agreement between
Morrison and Infratil. The Agreement allows for incentives to be payable for performance in excess of a minimum hurdle of 12% per annum in three
separate areas:
• Initial Incentive Fees;
• Annual Incentive Fees; and,
• Realised Incentive Fees.
To the extent that there are assets that meet these criterion, independent valuations are performed on the respective International Investments
to determine whether any Incentive Fees are payable.
International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee
The Company's investments in Kao Data and Gurīn Energy are eligible for the International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee assessment as at
31 March 2024 (31 March 2023: Qscan Group). Kao Data and Gurīn Energy have generated a total initial incentive fee of $38.8 million
(Kao Data: $15.6 million, Gurīn Energy: $22.8 million) (31 March 2023: nil).
International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee
Thereafter International Investments are grouped together, and an Annual Incentive Fee is payable at 20% of the outperformance of those assets
against the higher of, a benchmark of 12% per annum after tax, relative to the most recent 31 March valuation, or cost.
The Company’s investments in CDC Data Centres, Galileo, Longroad Energy, RetireAustralia and Qscan Group are eligible for the International
Portfolio Annual Incentive fee assessment as at 31 March 2024 (31 March 2023: CDC Data Centres, Galileo, Longroad Energy, RetireAustralia).
Based on independent valuations obtained as at 31 March 2024, an Annual Incentive Fee of $89.0 million has been accrued as at that date
(31 March 2023: $169.6 million).

 Independent Auditor’s Report
To the shareholders of Infratil Limited

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements




   Opinion

   in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to

   International Financial Reporting Standards issued
   by the New Zealand Accounting Standards Board.




                  Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
We are independent of the group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of
Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (Including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the
New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
Standards) (‘IESBA Code’), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements and the IESBA Code.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (NZ) are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
consolidated financial statements section of our report.
Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to climate related assurance, taxation services,
audit of regulatory disclosures, other assurance engagements and a cultural capability assessment. Subject to
certain restrictions, partners and employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the
ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our
independence as auditor of the group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.




                  Scoping
The scope of our audit is designed to ensure that we perform adequate work to be able to give an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the financial reporting
systems, processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates.

      The context for our audit is set by the group's major activities in the financial year ended 31 March 2024. In
      establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed
      at the component level by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors operating under
      our instruction.

      A full scope audit was performed on the most significant investments for the group using component materialities
      which were lower than group materiality. The component materiality considered the size and the risk profile of each
      component.

      Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have
      in the audit work at those investments to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had
      been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. We kept in regular
      communication with component audit teams throughout the year with phone calls, discussions and written
      instructions and ensured that the component audit teams had the appropriate skills and competencies which are
      needed for the audit. We reviewed the work undertaken by component auditors in order to ensure the quality and
      adequacy of their work.




                 Materiality
      The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Materiality helped us to determine the
      nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and
      on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a
      whole was set at $120 million determined with reference to a benchmark of group total assets. We chose the
      benchmark because, in our view, this is a key measure of the group’s performance.




                 Key audit matters
      Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
      the consolidated financial statements in the current period. We summarise below those matters and our key audit
      procedures to address those matters in order that the shareholders as a body may better understand the process
      by which we arrived at our audit opinion. Our procedures were undertaken in the context of and solely for the
      purpose of our statutory audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole and we do not express
      discrete opinions on separate elements of the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment
As disclosed in note 13 of the financial statements, the group has property, plant and equipment of $4.8 billion
(2023: $3.6 billion), with renewable generation assets, communication and network equipment, land and civil works
and buildings making up the majority of this balance. The group has a policy of recording classes of property, plant
and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, or at valuation. Renewable generation assets, land and civil
works and buildings are recorded at fair value, with valuations undertaken at least every three years and a material
change assessment carried out in the intervening years.

Renewable generation assets ($1.7 billion).

           Other information
The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for the other information included in the entity’s
Annual Report. Other information includes discussion and analysis of the business on pages 1 to 61 and
corporate governance disclosures on pages 133 to 146. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
does not cover any other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears materially misstated. If, based
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

            Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated
      financial statements
      The Directors, on behalf of the company, are responsible for:
      — the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
          accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
          Reporting Standards) and International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the New Zealand Accounting
          Standards Board;
      — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a consolidated set of financial statements
          that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
      — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related
          to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
          cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.




                   Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated
                   financial statements
      Our objective is:
      — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
          misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
      — to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
      Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
      with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
      Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
      could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
      consolidated financial statements.
