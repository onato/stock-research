1. EBITDAF is a non-GAAP measure of net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, financial derivative movements, revaluations, and
   non-operating gains or losses on the sales of investments and assets. EBITDAF does not have a standardised meaning and should not be viewed in isolation,
   nor considered a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as it may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by
   other entities. Proportionate EBITDAF shows Infratil’s operating costs and its share of the EBITDAF of the companies it has invested in. It excludes discontinued
   operations and management incentive fees. A reconciliation of net profit after tax to Proportionate EBITDAF is provided in the 30 September 2021 Interim
   Results Presentation.

Financial Performance
& Position
Infratil provides audited financial statements annually for years to 31 March. The six month interim accounts to 30 September are
reviewed by Infratil’s auditors but not audited. A summary of the interim accounts is provided in this report. The full financial
statements are available by contacting Infratil or on its website.
Infratil consolidates companies when it owns more than 50%, including Trustpower, Wellington Airport, Qscan and Pacific Radiology.

investments, the EBITDAF column shows 100% of their EBITDAF and the "Revaluations and other adjustments" column includes the
adjustment required to reconcile Infratil's share of their net surplus after tax. The contribution of Pacific Radiology is for the period
since its acquisition on 31 May 2021.
