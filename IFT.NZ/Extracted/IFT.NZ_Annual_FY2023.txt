Directors




Infratil’s shareholders elect
directors for three-year terms
to look after their interests.
Directors are expected to:
• Maintain a dialogue with shareholders,
  to understand concerns and priorities.
• Participate in the formation and evolution
  of the Company’s strategy.
• Ensure effective articulation to external
  stakeholders of strategy, goals, risks and
  performance, including with regard to
  environmental, social and governance
  metrics.
• Monitor strategy implementation,
  financial performance, risks and legal
  compliance.
• Maintain awareness of relevant societal
  and market developments and provide
  diversity of perspective and knowledge
  relevant to the Company.
• Monitor the performance of Infratil’s
  manager H.R.L. Morrison & Co.
  Morrison & Co is a specialist manager
  of infrastructure investments and
  performs this role for Infratil under an
  investment management agreement.
  Infratil benefits from having a
  management team with great breadth
  and depth of skills, however the Board
  must be vigilant about potential conflicts
  of interest and satisfied that the cost is
  reasonable relative to the alternative.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been calculated using the FVLCD approach on a discounted cash flow model (classified as a Level 3 fair value
based on the inputs in the valuation).                                                                                                                         2022

The future cash flows were discounted using a post-tax weighted cost of capital (‘WACC’) for the Qscan group of 10.38%.                                        Cost or valuation

Assumptions used in the interest rate sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in interest rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of 100 basis points
higher/lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate the sensitivity of the Group to movements in interest rates. The sensitivity was calculated by
taking interest rate instruments including loans and borrowings, bonds, interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps at balance date
and adjusting the interest rate upwards and downwards to quantify the resulting impact to profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
