RetireAustralia’s functional currency is Australian Dollars (A$) and the summary financial information shown is presented in this currency. The NZD/AUD
exchange rates used to convert the summary financial information to the Group’s functional currency (NZ$) were 0.9287 (Spot rate) and 0.9429
(Average rate) (2021: Spot rate 0.9182, Average rate 0.9338).
RetireAustralia’s net current asset deficiency has primarily arisen due to the requirement under Accounting Standards to classify resident obligations as
current liabilities as RetireAustralia does not have the right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
(residents may give notice of their intention to vacate their unit with immediate effect). In contrast, the corresponding assets are classified as non-current
under Accounting Standards.
On 1 March 2022, Infratil announced that it intended to undertake a Strategic Review of its shareholding in RetireAustralia. The Strategic Review will be
undertaken in conjunction with the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. As at 31 March 2022 RetireAustralia is not deemed to be held for sale as the
requirement of IFRS 5 have not been met.

9 Acquisition of subsidiaries
9.1 Pacific Radiology Group
On 31 May 2021, Infratil acquired 56.0% of Pacific Radiology Group Limited, (‘Pacific Radiology Group’), a comprehensive diagnostic
imaging practice in New Zealand, from existing doctor shareholders. Infratil invested in conjunction with existing doctor shareholders
and management (44.0%). Infratil has determined that Pacific Radiology Group is a subsidiary based on its voting equity interest and has
therefore consolidated Pacific Radiology Group from the acquisition date.
The acquisition of Pacific Radiology is in line with the company’s strategic direction outlined in February 2021, where healthcare was
identified as a sector of considerable opportunity. This builds on the acquisition of Qscan in the prior year with the Group looking to
create a meaningful Australasian healthcare platform with potential synergies and adjacent opportunities in the Group.
The transaction was settled in cash through a combination of equity contributions and external debt funding, inclusive of transaction
costs relating to the acquisition. Infratil’s total cash equity consideration transferred was NZ$313.6 million with the remainder funded
through external debt ($261.2 million). The non-controlling interest is determined by the cash consideration transferred of $246.4 million
from doctor and management shareholders.
RHC Holdco NZ Limited is the holding company which acquired 100% of the shares in Pacific Radiology Group. As a result,
NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations (‘NZ IFRS 3’) was required to be applied by RHC Holdco NZ Limited on acquisition. NZ IFRS 3
requires that the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of the business combination are measured at fair value at the date
of acquisition, with any gain recognised through the profit and loss and any deficit recognised as goodwill. Acquisition related costs are
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred. As Infratil controls RHC Holdco NZ Limited through
its shareholding, this is consolidated in the Group accounts.
Goodwill has been recognised based on the fair value of the carrying value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including
intangible assets. The total consideration transferred, including completion cash adjustments, exceeded the fair values of the net assets
acquired and the incremental amount paid of $753.8 million has been recognised as goodwill. The initial recognition exemption in
NZ IAS 12 has been applied to goodwill and therefore, no deferred tax deduction has been recognised.
The measurement of fair values of intangible assets used the relief-from-royalty method and the with and without method. The relief
from royalty estimates fair value based on the present value of future forgone royalty payments over the life of the asset not required to
be paid by virtue of owning the asset. The with and without methodology estimates fair value based on the difference between two
discounted cash-flow models: one that represents the status quo for the business enterprise with the asset in place, and another
without it.
On 29 October 2021, RHC Holdco NZ Limited acquired 100% of Auckland Radiology Group Services Limited, (‘Auckland Radiology’), a
diagnostic imaging practice based in Auckland, New Zealand. Subsequently, on 17 December 2021, RHC Holdco NZ Limited acquired
100% of Bay Radiology Limited, (‘Bay Radiology’), a diagnostic imaging practice in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. In both transactions
existing Doctor and Management shareholders reinvested part of their proceeds, acquiring shares in RHC Holdco NZ Limited. The
acquisition accounting required under IFRS 3 in relation to the Auckland Radiology and Bay Radiology transactions had not been
finalised as at 31 March 2022, and therefore certain amounts recorded in the financial statements are reported as provisional.
Goodwill has been provisionally recognised in both transactions based on the carrying value of the identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired, including intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets (customer contracts and brands) has been measured
provisionally, pending completion of an independent valuation. The total consideration transferred, including completion cash
adjustments, exceeded the carrying values of the net assets acquired and the incremental amount paid of $325.5 million
(Auckland Radiology: $210.1 million and Bay Radiology: $115.4 million) has been recognised as goodwill. The initial recognition exemption
in NZ IAS 12 has been applied to goodwill in both instances and therefore, no deferred tax deduction has been recognised.
The impact of the reinvestment by Auckland Radiology and Bay Radiology Doctor and Management shareholders was to dilute
Infratil’s shareholding in RHC Holdco NZ Limited to 50.5% at 31 March 2022.
For the 10 months ended 31 March 2022, RHC Holdco contributed revenue of $196.0 million and profit of $12.0 million to the Group’s
results (which includes acquisition-related costs of $24.9 million on legal fees and due diligence costs which are included in ‘radiology
business costs’). If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 April 2021, Management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been
$936.5 million and consolidated profit for the year would have been $1,250.8 million. In determining these amounts, management has
assumed the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the
acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2021.

9.2 Gurīn Energy
On 21 July, Infratil acquired 95% of a newly-formed entity, Gurīn Energy Pte Limited, a renewable energy development platform
headquartered in Singapore which will focus on greenfield renewable projects across Asia. Infratil has committed US$223 million
through equity of US$133 million (NZ$189 million) and US$100m (NZ $142 million) in the form of support for letters of credit provided
by 3rd party banks. The balance of equity is reserved for Management, financed by a loan from Infratil.
Infratil has determined that Gurīn is a subsidiary based on its voting equity interest and has therefore consolidated Gurīn from the
acquisition date.
As the newly formed entity has no material assets on establishment, no fair value exercise has been performed.		

9.3 Qscan prior year acquisition
During the year end 31 March 2022, the Group finalised its measurement of the fair value of consideration given and the net assets and
liabilities acquired in respect of the acquisition of Qscan in December 2021. Balances at 31 March 2021 have been restated to decrease
goodwill by $18.0 million, increase intangible assets by $33.4 million and deferred tax liability by $15.4 million.

10.1 Tilt Renewables
On 3 August 2021, the Group completed the sale of its 65.15% stake in Tilt Renewables for gross proceeds of $1,984.1 million to a
consortium comprising Powering Australian Renewables and Mercury NZ Limited. After sales costs, the net proceeds from the sale of
Infratil’s 65.15% interest were $1,837.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of the 65.15% interest of $1,136.8 million.
As the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in Tilt Renewables has been recovered through the sale transaction, the investment in
Tilt Renewables has been classified as a discontinued operation at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021. The comparative consolidated
statement of comprehensive income and respective notes have been presented to show the discontinued operation separately from
continuing operations. The results from discontinued operations are presented separately below.

10.2 Trustpower Retail Business
On 21 June 2021, Trustpower announced the conditional sale of its gas, telecommunications and retail electricity supply business
(excluding the supply of electricity to commercial and industrial customers) to Mercury NZ Limited for $441.0 million. Trustpower’s retail
business has been classified as an asset held for sale and a discontinued operation at 31 March 2022. The comparative consolidated
statement of comprehensive income and respective notes have been re-presented to show the discontinued operation separately
from continuing operations. As at 31 March 2022 the expected sales proceeds less costs to sell are higher than the carrying amount and
as a result no adjustment has been made to the carrying value of Infratil’s investment.

Included in operating expenses are $3.0 million of disposal costs (2021: nil).
The indicative gain on sale calculated above reflects the working capital that would be included as part of the sale if settlement
was 31 March 2022. Trustpower is retaining the accounts payable, other than employee entitlements, relating to the mass market retail
business on settlement. This working capital adjustment will differ based on the working capital transferred on the actual completion
date. Due to the proximity of the sale date to the issue of these financial statements, final working capital and asset values and the
resultant gain on sale have not yet been determined.
Mercury NZ Limited and Trustpower signed a pre-agreed electricity price contract for difference on 2 May 2022 which approximates
the volume used by the mass market retail business until 2025 before reducing each year until in matures in 2031. This contract for
difference was transferred at $1 in the sale and purchase agreement. Immediately following the completion of the sale, the fair value of
this contract for difference resulted in a loss of $530.0 million. The key assumptions used in determining this value are consistent with
those described for electricity price derivatives in note 23.3.3. The only difference being the discount rate reflects the 10 year tenor of
this instrument.

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, or at fair value less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Fair value is determined by an independent valuer or by management with reference to independent experts, using recognised
valuation techniques. An independent valuer is engaged to provide a valuation if management does not have sufficient expertise to
perform the valuation. These valuations are undertaken on a systematic basis at least every five years. In years where a valuation is not
undertaken, a material change assessment of each asset class is performed to assess whether carrying amounts differ materially from
fair value. This assessment is undertaken with assistance from independent experts and includes reference to projections of future
revenues, volumes, operational and capital expenditure profiles, capacity, terminal values, the application of discount rates and
replacement values (as relevant to each class of asset) as an indicator of a possible material change in fair value. Where a material
change in fair value is identified, the carrying value is adjusted to bring carrying value materially in line with fair value.
There were no independent external valuations of property, plant and equipment performed as at 31 March 2022.
As at 31 March 2022 a material change assessment was performed for each asset class recorded at fair value less accumulated
depreciation. A summary of the fair value consideration is provided below.

Trustpower Renewable Generation Assets
Trustpower’s renewable generation assets are measured at fair value and are revalued by Independent external valuers, every three
years or more frequently if there is a significant change in value.
Trustpower’s renewable generation assets include land and buildings which are not separately identifiable from other generation assets.
Renewable generation assets were last independently revalued, using a discounted cash flow methodology, as at 31 March 2020, to
their estimated market value as assessed by Deloitte Corporate Finance. Based on the Group’s assessment there was no material
change identified in the carrying value of Trustpower’s generation assets at 31 March 2022.
The valuation of Trustpower’s renewable generation assets are sensitive to the inputs used in the discounted cash flow valuation model.
A sensitivity analysis of key inputs is given in the table below. The overall valuation has been determined to be between $1,569 million to
$2,001 million and, while the mid-point selected for revaluation purposes, any value within this range would be considered appropriate.
The sensitivities around weighted average cost of capital and avoided cost of transmission have been used to create this overall range.
The range is wider than in the prior year where only weighted average cost of capital has been used to determine the overall range.
The following table summarises the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuer to arrive at fair value at the
date of the last external valuation.

Wellington International Airport’s property, plant and equipment

Land
WIAL’s Land, Civil Assets and Buildings are measured at fair value.
The Group’s assessment of WIAL’s land indicated a material change in value with reference to New Zealand and Wellington house price
indices published by Real Estate of New Zealand, changes in commercial and industrial property values and consideration of other key
inputs. Savills (NZ) Limited assisted in the estimation of key inputs. Using the last independent external valuation performed for the year
ended 31 March 2018 as a base, further work was performed to estimate fair value including an assessment of key inputs into land value.
An increase in MVAU rate per hectare to $2.64 million (2021: $2.58 million) was adopted and was based on increases across residential,
commercial and industrial property. There has been no change to other key inputs from the prior year. Airport developers WACC has
been held at 9%. Based on this, a fair value increase of $11.3 million (2021: $76.8 million) has been made to the carrying value of land and
recognised in the Asset Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income.

Civil Assets
Based on the Group’s assessment which includes reference to the Waka Kotahi Construction index and the Producers Price index, and
assisted by WSP Opus International Consultants Limited, a fair value increase of $20.5 million has been made to the carrying value of
these assets in the Asset Revaluation Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income (2021: no change).
Buildings
The Buildings asset class is comprised of three main sub-components; (a) Specialised buildings, (b) Vehicle business assets and (c)
Hotel business assets.

(a) Specialised buildings
Based on the Group’s assessment which includes reference to the capital goods price index and consumer price index and assisted by
Savills (NZ) Limited, a fair value increase of $23.7 million has been made to the carrying value of these assets in the Asset Revaluation
Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income (2021: no material change).

(b) Vehicle business assets
Based on the Group’s assessment which includes reference to passenger forecasts and discounted cash flow modelling and assisted
by Savills (NZ) Limited, a fair value increase of $27.1 million has been made to the carrying value of these assets in the Asset Revaluation
Reserve and Other Comprehensive Income (2021: no material change).

(c) Hotel business assets
Based on the Group’s assessment which includes reference to passenger forecasts and discounted cash flow modelling and assisted
by Jones Lang LaSalle, a fair value increase of $0.9 million has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (2021: increase in
carrying value of $4.4 million was recognised in profit or loss and $1.1 million in Other Comprehensive Income).
The following tables summarise the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuers to arrive at fair value at
the date of the last external valuation.

During the year RHC Holdco Limited completed the acquisitions of Pacific Radiology, Auckland Radiology and Bay Radiology.
As outlined in note 9.1 these acquisitions gave rise to Goodwill of $1,079.2 million, noting the Goodwill in Auckland Radiology and
Bay Radiology remain provisional at 31 March 2022. Qscan also completed the measurement of the fair value of Goodwill and as
a result goodwill was restated to $673.3 million in the prior year.
The Goodwill arising from the acquisitions for RHC Holdco and for Qscan in the prior year is attributable mainly to the specialist nature
of the diagnostic imaging workforce and the synergies expected from integrating the companies into a meaningful Australasian
diagnostic imaging platform.
The carrying value of Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test to ensure the carrying value does not exceed the recoverable
amount at balance date.
In determining whether there are any indicators of impairment in relation to the Goodwill recognised in relation to the Company’s
investments in Qscan Group and RHC Holdco, their fair value has been assessed by evaluating the conditions and events specific
to those entities that may be indicate there is evidence of impairment.
In determining whether there are any indicators of impairment in relation to the Goodwill recognised in relation to the Company’s
investment in Trustpower, the fair value of the Company’s investment in Trustpower is assessed with reference to the market share
price quoted on the NZX at each reporting date.
As at 31 March 2022 there were no indicators of impairment (31 March 2021: there were no indicators of impairment).
Following the classification of Trustpower’s Retail business as held for sale, Goodwill of $13.3 million at the Group level has been
allocated to the Retail business on a Relative Value basis. This calculation was performed based on the sale price of the Retail
business when assessed against the total market capitalisation of Trustpower, on the date of the announcement of the retail sale.

Financing arrangements
Wholly owned subsidiaries
Infratil Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank facility arrangements with a negative pledge
agreement, which, with limited exceptions does not permit the Infratil Guaranteeing Group (‘IGG’) to grant any security over its assets.
The IGG comprises entities subject to a cross guarantee and comprises Infratil Limited, Infratil Finance Limited and certain other wholly
owned subsidiaries. These facilities are primarily used to fund the corporate and investment activities of the Company. The IGG does not
incorporate the underlying assets of the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and associates. The IGG bank facilities also include
restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement. Liability under the cross guarantee is limited to the
amount of debt drawn under the IGG facilities, plus any unpaid interest and costs of recovery.
In October 2021, Infratil Finance refinanced all of its IGG bank facilities, extending the maturity of facilities and negotiating improved
terms to better reflect the nature of Infratil’s business, having evolved significantly over the term of the previous facilities. This included
bringing Infratil Energy New Zealand Limited (‘IENZ’) into the Infratil Guaranteeing Group. IENZ had previously maintained a standalone
bank facility and related security arrangements, under which $125.0 million was fully drawn as at 31 March 2021.
At 31 March 2022 there was no drawn debt or accrued interest payable under the IGG facilities (31 March 2021: $217.3 million) and
undrawn IGG facilities totalled $1,169.0 million (31 March 2021: $353.0 million).
Non-wholly owned subsidiaries
The Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries also enter into bank facility arrangements. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are
included within loans and borrowings in the table above. These facilities are primarily used to fund the activities of those non-wholly
owned subsidiaries. Wellington International Airport and Trustpower’s facilities are both subject to negative pledge arrangements, which
with limited exceptions does not permit those entities to grant security over their respective assets. Qscan Group and Pacific Radiology
borrow under syndicated bank debt facilities, under which security is granted over their respective assets. All non-wholly owned
subsidiary facilities are subject to restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement.
The various bank facilities across the Group require the relevant borrowing group to maintain certain levels of shareholder funds and
operate within defined performance and gearing ratios. Throughout the period the Group has complied with all debt covenant
requirements as imposed by the respective lenders (refer to note 22 for information in respect of waivers of certain financial covenants
obtained by Wellington International Airport Limited).
Interest rates
Interest rates payable on bank loan facilities are floating rate determined by reference to prevailing money market rates at the time of
draw-down plus a margin. Interest rates paid during the year ranged from 0.75% to 4.32% (31 March 2021: 0.57% to 4.32%).

Trustpower’s unsecured senior bonds rank equally with their bank loans. Trustpower borrows under a negative pledge arrangement,
which with limited exceptions does not permit Trustpower to grant any security interest over its assets. The Trust Deed for these bonds
requires Trustpower to maintain certain levels of shareholders’ funds and operate within defined performance and debt gearing ratios.
The arrangements under the Trust Deed may also create restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets unless the senior bonds
are repaid or renegotiated. Throughout the year Trustpower complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by its bond
supervisor.
At 31 March 2022 Trustpower’s unsecured senior bonds had a fair value of $350.8 million (31 March 2021: $455.9 million).

The Trust Deed for the retail bonds requires Wellington International Airport (‘WIAL’) to operate within defined performance and debt
gearing ratios. The arrangements under the Trust Deed creates restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets. Throughout the
year WIAL complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by the retail bond supervisor.
On 27 July 2017 WIAL completed a United States Private Placement (‘USPP’) Note issuance, securing US$72 million of long term debt.
The USPP comprised two equal tranches, a US$36 million 10 year Note with a coupon of 3.47% and a US$36 million 12 year Note with
a coupon of 3.59%. In conjunction with the USPP issuance, WIAL entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to formally hedge the
exposure to foreign currency risk over the term of the notes.
At 31 March 2022 WIAL’s bonds had a fair value of $522.9 million (2021: $481.9 million), and WIAL’s USPP Notes had a fair value of
$110.9 million (2021: $108.4 million).
The USPP notes are measured at amortised cost, translated to New Zealand dollars using the spot rate at balance date.

Financial Covenants and Other Restrictions
As at 31 March 2022 WIAL has bank facilities amounting to $100 million (31 March 2021: $170 million), which remain undrawn at
31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: $70 million). These facilities and the US$72 million USPP Notes have certain financial covenants.
Due to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19, WIAL has worked with its banking group and USPP lenders to secure relief in respect of the
interest cover ratio for the 31 March 2022 test date. Notwithstanding this relief, WIAL has met all its covenants at 31 March 2022.

23 Financial instruments
The Group has exposure to the following risks due to its business activities and financial policies:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Market risk

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes
for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital.

23.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group is
exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business including those arising from trade receivables with its customers, financial
derivatives and transactions (including cash balances) with financial institutions. The Group minimises its exposure to credit risk of
trade receivables through the adoption of counterparty credit limits and standard payment terms. Derivative counterparties and cash
transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and organisations in the relevant industry. The Group’s exposure and
the credit ratings of significant counterparties are monitored, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded are spread amongst
approved counterparties. The carrying amounts of financial assets recognised in the Statement of Financial Position best represent the
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date. Generally no security is held on these amounts.

23.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that assets held by the Group cannot readily be converted to cash to meet the Group’s contracted cash flow
obligations. Liquidity risk is monitored by continuously forecasting cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and
liabilities. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due
and make value investments, under both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the
Group’s reputation. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities, the spreading of debt maturities, and its credit standing in capital markets.
The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities, excluding gross settled derivative financial liabilities, into relevant maturity
groupings based on the earliest possible contractual maturity date at year end. The amounts in the tables below are contractual
undiscounted cash flows, which include interest through to maturity. Perpetual Infratil Infrastructure Bonds cash flows have been
determined by reference to the longest dated Infratil bond maturity in the year 2029.

23.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and energy prices will affect the
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial assets and liabilities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
23.3.1 Interest rate risk (cash flow and fair value)
Interest rate risk is the risk of interest rate volatility negatively affecting the Group’s interest expense cash flow and earnings. Infratil mitigates
this risk by managing it’s interest rate exposures in accordance with it’s Group Treasury Policy, which sets out defined maximum and
minimum thresholds for exposures to floating interest rates across different tenors. Infratil achieves compliance with these thresholds by
issuing term borrowings at fixed interest rates and entering into Interest Rate Swaps to convert a portion of floating rate exposures to fixed
rate exposures. Borrowings issued at fixed rates does expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.

Assumptions used in the interest rate sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in interest rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of 100 basis
points higher/lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate the sensitivity of the Group to movements in interest rates. The sensitivity
was calculated by taking interest rate instruments including loans and borrowings, bonds, interest rate swaps and cross currency interest
rate swaps at balance date and adjusting the interest rate upwards and downwards to quantify the resulting impact to profit or loss and
other comprehensive income.
23.3.2 Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk on the value of its net investment in foreign investments, assets and liabilities, future
investment obligations and future income. Foreign currency obligations and income are recognised as soon as the flow of funds is likely to
occur. Decisions on buying forward cover for likely foreign currency investments is subject to the Group’s expectation of the fair value of the
relevant exchange rate.
The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk from price fluctuations of foreign currency commitments
associated with the construction of generation assets and to hedge the risk of its net investment in foreign operations. Any resulting
differential to be paid or received as a result of the currency hedging of the asset is reflected in the final cost of the asset. The Group has
elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to these instruments.
The following table shows the impact on post-tax profit and equity if the New Zealand dollar had weakened or strengthened by
10 per cent against the currencies with which the Group has foreign currency risk with, all other variables held constant.

Assumptions used in the foreign currency exposure sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in foreign exchange rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement
of plus or minus 10% has been applied to the AUD/NZD, USD/NZD, EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD exchange rates to demonstrate the
sensitivity of foreign currency risk of the company’s investment in foreign operations and associated derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity was calculated by taking the AUD and USD spot rate as at balance date, moving this spot rate by plus and minus 10% and
then reconverting the AUD and USD balances with the ‘new spot-rate’.

Unhedged foreign currency exposures
At balance date the Group has the following unhedged exposure to foreign currency risk arising on foreign currency monetary assets
and liabilities that fall due within the next twelve months:

23.3.3 Energy price risk
Energy Price Risk is the risk that financial performance will be impacted by fluctuations in spot energy prices. The Group meets its energy sales
demand by purchasing energy on spot markets, physical deliveries and financial derivative contracts. This exposes the Group to fluctuations
in the spot and forward price of energy. The Group has entered into a number of energy hedge contracts to reduce the energy price risk
from price fluctuations. These hedge contracts establish the price at which future specified quantities of energy are purchased and settled. Any
resulting differential to be paid or received is recognised as a component of energy costs through the term of the contract. The Group has
elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to those instruments it deems material and which qualify as cash flow hedges.
The hedged anticipated electricity purchase transactions are expected to occur continuously throughout the next three years from the end of
the reporting period consistent with Trustpower’s forecast electricity generation and retail electricity sales. Gains and losses recognised in the
cash flow hedge reserve on electricity derivatives as of 31 March 2022 will be continuously released to the income statement in each period in
which the underlying purchase transactions are recognised in the income statement.

                                                                                                                            2022             2021

At balance date the aggregate notional volume of outstanding energy derivatives were:

As at 31 March 2022, the Group had energy contracts outstanding with various maturities expected to occur continuously throughout the
next five years. The hedged anticipated energy purchase transactions are expected to occur continuously throughout the contract period
from balance sheet date consistent with the Group’s forecast energy generation and retail energy sales. Gains and losses recognised in
the cash flow hedge reserve on energy derivatives as of 31 March 2022 will be continuously released to the income statement in each
period in which the underlying purchase transactions are recognised in the profit or loss.

Assumptions used in the energy forward price sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in energy forward prices were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement
of 10% higher/lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate sensitivity to movements in forward energy prices. The sensitivity was
calculated by taking balances that incorporate expectations of forward electricity prices at balance date and adjusting the forward
electricity price upwards and downwards to quantify the resulting impact to profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

23.4 Fair values
With the exception of bond debt and senior notes which are measured at amortised cost, financial assets and financial liabilities are
measured at fair value, and have a fair value at 31 March 2022 of $2,307.3 million (31 March 2021: $2,382.7 million) compared to an
amortised cost value of $2,360.9 million (31 March 2021: $2,397.6 million).

Estimation of fair values
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined
  with reference to quoted market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated using market-quoted rates based on discounted cash flow analysis.
• The fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made
  of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve or available forward price data for the duration of the instruments.

Where the fair value of a derivative is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the instrument, the two key
types of variables used by the valuation techniques are:
• forward price curve (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices); and
• discount rates.

The selection of variables requires significant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions in respect
of these variables that could be used in estimating the fair value of these derivatives. Maximum use is made of observable market data
when selecting variables and developing assumptions for the valuation techniques.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or
  indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3)

The following tables present the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

23.5 Risk Management Framework
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group
has established an Audit and Risk Committee for Infratil and each of its significant subsidiaries and associates with responsibilities which
include reviewing management practices in relation to identification and management of significant business risk areas and regulatory
compliance. The Group has developed a comprehensive, enterprise wide risk management framework. Management and Boards
throughout the Group participate in the identification, assessment and monitoring of new and existing risks. Particular attention is given to
strategic risks that could affect the Group. Management report to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board on the relevant risks and
the controls and treatments for those risks.

23.6 Capital Management
The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests of the Group. From time to time the
Group purchases its own shares on the market with the timing of these purchases dependent on market prices, an assessment of value
for shareholders and an available window to trade on the NZX. Primarily the shares are intended to be held as treasury stock and may be
reissued under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan or cancelled. During the year the Group issued 1,031,049 shares (2021: none). The
Company and the Group’s borrowings are subject to certain compliance ratios in accordance with the facility agreements or the trust
deed applicable to the borrowings. During the year there have been no breaches in the compliance ratios (2021: nil).
The Group seeks to ensure that no more than 20% of its non-bank debt is maturing in any one year period, and to spread the maturities
of its bank debt facilities between one and five years. Discussions on refinancing of facilities will normally commence at least six months
before maturity. Facilities are maintained with A (2021: A) or above rated financial institutions, and with a minimum number of bank
counterparties to ensure diversification. The Group manages its interest rate profile so as to minimise value volatility. This means having
interest costs fixed for extended terms. At times when long rates appear to be sustainably high, the profile may be shortened, and when
rates are low the profile may be lengthened.

New Zealand Portfolio Management Fee
The New Zealand base management fee is paid on the ‘New Zealand Company Value’ at 0.80% p.a. on the New Zealand Company
Value above $150 million, 1.00% p.a. on the New Zealand Company Value between $50 million and $150 million and 1.125% p.a. on
New Zealand Company value up to $50 million. The New Zealand Company Value is defined as:
• the Company’s market capitalisation as defined in the Management Agreement (the aggregated market value of the Company’s
  listed securities, being ordinary shares, partly paid shares and, Infratil Infrastructure bonds);
• plus the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries’ net debt (excluding listed debt securities and the book value of the debt in any
  non-Australasian investments);
• minus the cost price of any non-Australasian investments; and,
• an adjustment for foreign exchange gains or losses related to non-New Zealand investments.
International Portfolio Management Fee
The international fund management fee is paid at the rate of 1.50% per annum on:
• the cost price of any non-Australasian investments; and,
• the book value of the debt in any wholly owned non-Australasian investments.
International Portfolio Incentive Fees
International Investments are eligible for International Portfolio incentive fees (‘Incentive fees’) under the Management Agreement
between MCIM and Infratil. The Agreement allows for incentives to be payable for performance in excess of a minimum hurdle of
12% per annum in three separate areas:
• Initial Incentive Fees;
• Annual Incentive Fees; and,
• Realised Incentive Fees.
To the extent that there are assets that meet these criterion, independent valuations are performed on the respective International
Investments to determine whether any Incentive Fees are payable.
International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee
International Investments become eligible for the Initial Incentive Fee assessment on the third balance date (31 March) that they have
been held continuously by the Company. All International Investments that are acquired in any one financial year are grouped together
for the purposes of the Initial Incentive Fee, and an Initial Incentive Fee is payable at 20% of the outperformance of those assets against
a benchmark of 12% p.a. after tax, compounding.
The Company’s investment in Galileo Green Energy was eligible for the International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee as at 31 March 2022.
(31 March 2021: None). Based on an independent valuation obtained as at that date, no International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee has
been accrued as at 31 March 2022.
International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee
Thereafter International Investments are grouped together, and an Annual Incentive Fee is payable at 20% of the outperformance of
those assets against the higher of, a benchmark of 12% p.a. after tax, relative to the most recent 31 March valuation, or cost.
The Company’s investments in CDC Data Centres, Longroad Energy and RetireAustralia are eligible for the International Portfolio
Annual Incentive fee assessment as at 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: ASIP, RetireAustralia, CDC Data Centres, Longroad Energy and
Tilt Renewables).
Based on independent valuations obtained as at 31 March 2022, an Annual Incentive Fee of $99.7 million has been accrued as at that
date (31 March 2021: $223.1 million).

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements


   Opinion
   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements                                   We have audited the accompanying consolidated
   of Infratil Limited (the ’company’) and its subsidiaries                                financial statements which comprise:
   (the 'group') on pages 82 to 140:
                                                                                           — the consolidated statement of financial position

      Reporting Standards.                                                                       accounting policies.




                 Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
We are independent of the group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of
Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (Including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the
New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
Standards) (‘IESBA Code’), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements and the IESBA Code.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (NZ) are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
consolidated financial statements section of our report.
Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to taxation services, audit of regulatory
disclosures, other assurance engagements and other consultancy services. Subject to certain restrictions, partners
and employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading
activities of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as auditor of the group.
The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.



                 Scoping
The scope of our audit is designed to ensure that we perform adequate work to be able to give an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the significance and
risk profile of each investment it owns, the group’s accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which
the investments operates.

                                                                                                                                                                                  141
      In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be
      performed at the component level by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors operating under
      our instruction.
      A full scope audit was performed on the most significant investments for the group using component materialities
      which were lower than group materiality. The component materiality took into account the size and the risk profile
      of each component.
      Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to
      have in the audit work at those investments to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence
      had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. We kept in regular
      communication with component audit teams throughout the year with phone calls, discussions and written
      instructions and ensured that the component audit teams had the appropriate skills and competencies which are
      needed for the audit. We reviewed the work undertaken by component auditors in order to ensure the quality and
      adequacy of their work.




                 Materiality
      The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Materiality helped us to determine the
      nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
      and on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The materiality for the consolidated financial statements
      as a whole was set at $45 million determined with reference to a benchmark of group total assets. We chose total
      assets given the asset intensive nature of the group’s underlying investments and that this is a more stable and
      relevant measure than a profit measure. Materiality represents 0.5% of the selected benchmark.



                 Key audit matters
      Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
      the consolidated financial statements in the current period. We summarise below those matters and our key audit
      procedures to address those matters in order that the shareholders as a body may better understand the process
      by which we arrived at our audit opinion. Our procedures were undertaken in the context of and solely for the
      purpose of our statutory audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole and we do not express
      discrete opinions on separate elements of the consolidated financial statements

million (2021: $3,239 million), with renewable generation assets, land and civil works and buildings making up
the majority of this balance. The group has a policy of recording classes of property, plant and equipment at
cost less accumulated depreciation, or at valuation, with valuations undertaken at least every 5 years with a
material change assessment carried out in the intervening years.

           Other information
The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for the other information included in the entity’s Annual
Report. Other information includes the reports of the Chief Executive and the Chair, Infratil’s summary financial
information, and disclosures relating to strategy, corporate governance, Infratil’s businesses and statutory
information (on pages 1 to 81 and page 141 to 163). Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does
not cover any other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.



           Use of this independent auditor’s report
This independent auditor’s report is made solely to the shareholders as a body. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in the
independent auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the shareholders as a body for our audit work, this independent
auditor’s report, or any of the opinions we have formed.



       Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial
statements
The Directors, on behalf of the company, are responsible for:
— the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
    Reporting Standards)
— implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a consolidated set of financial statements
    that is fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error ; and




                                                                                                                  5

      — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
          going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
          cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.



                   Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
                   statements
      Our objective is:
      — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
          material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
      — to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
      Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
      with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
      Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
      could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
      consolidated financial statements.
      A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of these consolidated financial statements is located at

  documented under NZX’s transition arrangements for the                     and/or the third instalment of the Financial Year 2020
  current NZX Listing Rules). The effect of the waiver is to waive           international portfolio annual incentive fee in 2021.

  management or advisory services. The waiver is provided on               it, and where it has adopted alternative arrangements which the
  the conditions specified in paragraph 2 of the waiver decision.          Board considers are more appropriate.
  Infratil has not relied on this waiver during Financial Year 2022.
