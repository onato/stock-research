Valuation differences between the
New Zealand and Australian assets are          New Zealand
likely to reflect expected net earnings
from existing wind farms (due to
different offtake prices and required
rates of return) and more materially,
differences in expected new-build
prospects. Australia needs a very large
investment in renewable generation to
allow the phase out of the use of coal.
Tilt’s Australian options are well
positioned to benefit as they are
located on quality buildable sites on the
strongest parts of the transmission grid.        Hydro

converting the nominal costs into real

wind farm economics have improved.

1. EBITDAF is a non-GAAP measure of net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, financial derivative movements, revaluations, and
   non-operating gains or losses on the sales of investments and assets. EBITDAF does not have a standardised meaning and should not be viewed in isolation,
   nor considered a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as it may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by
   other entities. Proportionate EBITDAF shows Infratil’s operating costs and its share of the EBITDAF of the companies it has invested in. It excludes discontinued
   operations and management incentive fees. A reconciliation of net profit after tax to Proportionate EBITDAF is provided in the 31 March 2021 Annual Results
   Presentation.

Borrowings are recorded initially at fair value, net of transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are measured
at amortised cost with any difference between the initial
recognised amount and the redemption value being recognised
in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using the effective
interest rate. Bond and bank debt issue expenses, fees and other
costs incurred in arranging finance are capitalised and amortised
over the term of the relevant debt instrument or debt facility.

RetireAustralia’s net current asset deficiency has primarily arisen due to the requirement under Accounting Standards to classify resident obligations as
current liabilities as RetireAustralia does not have the right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
(residents may give notice of their intention to vacate their unit with immediate effect). In contrast, the corresponding assets are classified as non-current
under Accounting Standards.

9 Acquisition of subsidiary
On 22 December 2020, Infratil acquired 56.25% of Qscan Group Holdings Pty Limited (subsequently renamed Qscan Intermediary 1 Pty
Limited) (‘Qscan Group’), a comprehensive diagnostic imaging practice located in Australia. Infratil invested in conjunction with the
Morrison & Co Growth Infrastructure Fund (‘MGIF’) (14.06%) and existing doctor and management shareholders (29.69%). Infratil has
determined that Qscan Group is a subsidiary based on its voting equity interest and has therefore consolidated Qscan Group from the
acquisition date.
The transaction was settled in cash through a combination of equity contributions and external debt funding, inclusive of transaction
costs relating to the acquisition. Infratil’s cash consideration transferred was A$289.6 million. The non-controlling interest is determined
by the cash consideration transferred of A$72.6 million from MGIF and A$152.9 million from doctor and management shareholders.
The nature of the holding structure under which Infratil and its investment partners acquired Qscan Group meant that Qscan
Intermediary 1 Pty Limited ultimately acquired 100% of the shares in Qscan Group. As a result, NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations ('NZ IFRS
3') is required to be applied on acquisition. NZ IFRS 3 requires that the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of the business
combination are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition, with any gain recognised through the profit and loss and any deficit
recognised as goodwill. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
The fair value of intangible assets acquired (including hospital contracts and brands) has been measured on a provisional basis. The
valuation of the brands and hospital contracts will be conducted post finalisation of the 31 March 2021 financial statements and
therefore amounts in the financial statements will be reported as provisional. If new information obtained within one year of the date of
acquisition about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any
additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition, then the accounting for the acquisition will be revised.
Goodwill has been provisionally recognised at fair value on the carrying value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired,
including intangible assets. The total consideration transferred, including completion cash adjustments, exceeded the fair values of the
net assets acquired and the incremental amount paid of $691.3 million has been recognised as goodwill. The initial recognition
exemption in NZ IAS 12 has been applied to goodwill and therefore, no deferred tax deduction has been recognised.

10.1 Tilt Renewables
On 15 March 2021, Infratil confirmed its support for the acquisition of Tilt Renewables under a Scheme of Arrangement by a consortium
comprising Powering Australian Renewables (‘PowAR’) and Mercury NZ Limited (‘Mercury’). Under the Scheme Implementation
Agreement (‘SIA’), it is proposed that PowAR will acquire Tilt's Australian business, and Mercury will acquire Tilt's New Zealand business.
Under the original proposal, Tilt shareholders were to receive NZ$7.80 per share in cash on completion. Subsequent to balance date, Tilt
Renewables announced that it had amended the SIA to increase the scheme consideration to NZ$8.10 per share. As a result of that
increase, Infratil’s gross proceeds are expected to be approximately $2,000.2 million. As the carrying amount of the Group’s investment
in Tilt is expected to be recovered through a sale transaction, the investment in Tilt has been classified as held for sale and a
discontinued operation at 31 March 2021. The comparative consolidated statement of comprehensive income and respective notes
have been re-presented to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. As at 31 March 2021 the expected
sales proceeds less costs to sell are higher than the carrying amount and as a result no adjustment has been made to the carrying
value of Infratil's investment.

There was $129.4 million of cumulative income/(loss) recognised in other comprehensive income relating to Tilt Renewables at
31 March 2021 (31 March 2020: $31.3 million).

of the individual assets and liabilities that relate to Tilt Renewables to assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2021.

As at 31 March 2021 the carrying amount of the Group's investment in ASIP is expected to be recovered through a sale transaction

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, or at fair value less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Fair value is determined by an independent valuer or by management with reference to independent experts, using recognised
valuation techniques. An independent valuer is engaged to provide a valuation if management does not have sufficient expertise to
perform the valuation. These valuations are undertaken on a systematic basis at least every five years. In years where a valuation is not
undertaken, a material change assessment of each asset class is performed to assess whether carrying amounts differ materially from
fair value. This assessment may be undertaken with assistance from independent experts and includes reference to projections of future
revenues, volumes, operational and capital expenditure profiles, capacity, terminal values, the application of discount rates and
replacement values (as relevant to each class of asset) as an indicator of a possible material change in fair value. Where a material
change in fair value is identified, the carrying value is adjusted to bring carrying value materially in line with fair value.
There were no independent external valuations of property, plant and equipment performed as at 31 March 2021.
As at 31 March 2021 a material change assessment was performed for each asset class held at fair value. A summary is provided below.

Trustpower generation property, plant and equipment
Trustpower's generation assets include land and buildings which are not separately identifiable from other generation assets.
Generation assets were independently revalued, using a discounted cash flow methodology, as at 31 March 2020, to their estimated
market value as assessed by Deloitte Corporate Finance. Based on the Group’s assessment there was no material change identified in
the carrying value of Trustpower’s generation assets at 31 March 2021.
The valuation of Trustpower’s generation assets is sensitive to the inputs used in the discounted cash flow valuation model.
A sensitivity analysis of key inputs is given in the table below. The overall valuation has been determined to be between $1,569 million to
$2,001 million and, while the mid-point selected for revaluation purposes, any value within this range would be considered appropriate.
The sensitivities around weighted average cost of capital and avoided cost of transmission have been used to create this overall range.
The following table summarises the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuer to arrive at fair value at
the date of the last external valuation.

Tilt Renewables' generation property, plant and equipment
Tilt Renewables’ generation assets were independently revalued, using a discounted cash flow methodology, as at 31 March 2020, to
their estimated market value as assessed by Deloitte Corporate Finance. Based on the Group’s assessment there was no material
change identified in the carrying value of Tilt Renewables’ generation assets at 31 March 2021.
The valuation of Tilt Renewables' generation assets is sensitive to the inputs used in the discounted cash flow valuation model. A
sensitivity analysis around some key inputs is given in the table below. The valuation is based on a combination of values that are
generally at the midpoint of the range. The valuation impact is calculated as the movement in the fair value as a result of the change in
the assumption and keeping all other valuation inputs constant. In addition to the tests below, a separate sensitivity analysis has been
conducted to assess the impact of varying future cash flows for increases or decreases of up to 10% in market prices (including
New Zealand market prices beyond the fixed price period to March 2025). None of these tests resulted in an impairment of the fair value
of generation, property, plant and equipment.
The following table summarises the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuer to arrive at fair value at
the date of the last external valuation.

Wellington International Airport's property, plant and equipment
Land and civil works

The Group's assessment of WIAL’s land indicated a material change in value with reference to New Zealand and Wellington property
price indices. Using the last full independent valuation performed at 31 March 2018 as a base, further work was performed to estimate
fair value including assessing key inputs into WIAL’s Market Value for Existing Use (‘MVEU’) valuation. Savills (NZ) Limited assisted with this
process. An increase in the average rate per hectare from $1.86 million to $2.58 million was considered appropriate and based on
respective increases across residential, commercial and industrial property. A reduction in the developer’s WACC rate from 10.4% to
9.0% has been made primarily due to a reduction in the risk-free rate as published by the Commerce Commission. Based on this, a fair
value adjustment of $76.8 million (2020: $12.0 million) has been made to the carrying value of Land and recognised in the revaluation
reserve and other comprehensive income.

Based on the Group’s assessment there was no material change identified in the carrying value of Civil Works assets at 31 March 2021.

Buildings

The Buildings asset class is comprised of three main sub-components; (a) Specialised buildings, (b) Vehicle business assets and
(c) Hotel business assets.

(a) Specialised buildings
Based on the Group's assessment which includes reference to the capital goods price index and construction index and assisted by
Savills (NZ) Limited, there was no material change identified in the carrying value of these assets at 31 March 2021 (2020: $22.3 million
increase was recognised in revaluation reserve and other comprehensive income).



                                                                                                                                           101
(b) Vehicle business assets
Based on the Group's assessment which includes reference to passenger forecasts and discounted cash flow modelling assisted by
Savills (NZ) Limited, there was no material change in the carrying value of these assets at 31 March 2021 (2020: $7.7 million reduction
was recognised in revaluation reserve and other comprehensive income).

(c) Hotel business assets
Based on the Group's material change assessment which includes reference to passenger forecasts and discounted cash flow
modelling, a fair value adjustment of $5.5 million has been recognised, of which $4.4 million is recognised in profit and loss (reversing
a previous impairment recognised) and $1.1 million recognised in other comprehensive income (2020: $4.4 million reduction was
recognised in profit and loss).

The following tables summarise the valuation approach and key assumptions used by the independent valuers to arrive at fair value
at the date of the last external valuation.

The acquisition of Qscan Group was completed on 22 December 2020, increasing the carrying value of goodwill to $770.7 million
(31 March 2020: $113.1 million). Further detail on the acquisition is outlined at Note 9.
The carrying value of goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test to ensure the carrying value does not exceed the recoverable
amount at balance date. In determining whether there are any indicators of impairment the fair value of the Company's investments in
Trustpower and Tilt Renewables are assessed with reference to the market share price quoted on the NZX at each reporting date. The
determination of any indicators of impairment in the fair value of Qscan Group's goodwill has been assessed at 31 March 2021 by
evaluating the conditions and events specific to the Group that may be indicative of impairment triggers. This being the first period of
operations and having acquired the business on 22 December 2020, recoverable amounts have been assessed by comparing the
actual earnings since acquisition with the forecasted earnings used to determine the fair value of the business at acquisition. The
acquired business is performing in line with these forecasts.
As at 31 March 2021 there were no indicators of impairment (31 March 2020: there were no indicators of impairment).

Financing arrangements
Infratil Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank facility arrangements with a negative pledge
agreement, which, with limited exceptions does not permit the Infratil Guaranteeing Group (‘IGG’) to grant any security over its assets.
The IGG comprises entities subject to a cross guarantee and comprises Infratil Limited, Infratil Finance Limited and certain other wholly
owned subsidiaries. The IGG does not incorporate the underlying assets of the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and
associates. The IGG bank facilities also include restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement. Liability
under the cross guarantee is limited to the amount of debt drawn under the IGG facilities, plus any unpaid interest and costs of
recovery. At 31 March 2021 drawn debt and accrued interest under the IGG facilities was $217.3 million (31 March 2020: $355.3 million)
and undrawn IGG facilities totalled $353.0 million (2020: $268.0 million).
Infratil Energy New Zealand Limited (‘IENZ’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is not a member of the IGG and has
granted a security interest over assets with a carrying amount of $342.3 million (31 March 2020: $310.2 million) as part of its bank
facility arrangements. IENZ has total facilities of $125.0 million, of which $125.0 million was drawn as at 31 March 2021
(31 March 2020: $125.0 million).
The Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries also enter into bank facility arrangements. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are
included within loans and borrowings in the table above. Wellington International Airport and Trustpower facilities are both subject to
negative pledge arrangements, which with limited exceptions does not permit those entities to grant security over their respective
assets. Tilt Renewables borrows under syndicated bank debt facilities (both general and project specific) and has granted security over
its assets. Qscan Group borrows under syndicated bank debt facilities and has granted security over its assets. All non-wholly owned
subsidiary facilities are subject to restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement. The various bank
facilities across the Group require the relevant borrowing group to maintain certain levels of shareholder funds and operate within
defined performance and gearing ratios. Throughout the period the Group has complied with all debt covenant requirements as
imposed by the respective lenders (refer to note 21 for information in respect of waivers of certain financial covenants obtained by
Wellington International Airport Limited).
Interest rates payable on bank loan facilities are floating rate determined by reference to prevailing money market rates at the time of
drawdown plus a margin. Interest rates paid during the year ranged from 0.57% to 4.32% (31 March 2020: 1.45% to 4.10%).

Trustpower's unsecured senior bonds rank equally with their bank loans. Trustpower borrows under a negative pledge arrangement,
which with limited exceptions does not permit Trustpower to grant any security interest over its assets. The Trust Deed for these bonds
requires Trustpower to maintain certain levels of shareholders' funds and operate within defined performance and debt gearing ratios.
The arrangements under the Trust Deed may also create restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets unless the senior
bonds are repaid or renegotiated. Throughout the year Trustpower complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by its
bond supervisor.
At 31 March 2021 Trustpower's unsecured senior bonds had a fair value of $455.9 million (31 March 2020: $443.0 million).

The Trust Deed for the retail bonds requires Wellington International Airport ('WIAL') to operate within defined performance and debt
gearing ratios. The arrangements under the Trust Deed creates restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets. Throughout the
year WIAL complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by the retail bond supervisor.
On 27 July 2017 WIAL completed a United States Private Placement ('USPP') Note issuance, securing US$72 million of long term debt.
The USPP comprised two equal tranches, a US$36 million 10 year Note with a coupon of 3.47% and a US$36 million 12 year Note with
a coupon of 3.59%. In conjunction with the USPP issuance, WIAL entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to formally hedge the
exposure to foreign currency risk over the term of the notes.
At 31 March 2021 WIAL's bonds had a fair value of $481.9 million (2020: $415.7 million), and WIAL's USPP Notes had a fair value
of $108.4 million (2020: $122.3 million).
The USPP notes are measured at amortised cost, translated to New Zealand dollars using the spot rate at balance date.

Financial Covenants and Other Restrictions
The impacts of covid have resulted in a significant reduction in WIAL's actual and forecast passenger numbers and income.
In response, during the year ended 31 March 2021 WIAL secured a temporary waiver of certain at-risk covenants with its banking group
and USPP lender until the first compliance date, which is no later than 31 March 2022. In addition, WIAL increased its bank facilities from
$100 million to $170 million and extended its bank facility maturity dates.

22 Financial instruments
The Group has exposure to the following risks due to its business activities and financial policies:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Market risk

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for
measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital.

22.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group
is exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business including those arising from trade receivables with its customers, financial
derivatives and transactions (including cash balances) with financial institutions. The Group minimises its exposure to credit risk of trade
receivables through the adoption of counterparty credit limits and standard payment terms. Derivative counterparties and cash
transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and organisations in the relevant industry. The Group’s exposure
and the credit ratings of significant counterparties are monitored, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded are spread
amongst approved counterparties. The carrying amounts of financial assets recognised in the Statement of Financial Position best
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date. Generally no security is held on these amounts.

Group’s large customer base in a diverse range of industries throughout New Zealand and Australia.

22.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that assets held by the Group cannot readily be converted to cash to meet the Group's contracted cash flow
obligations. Liquidity risk is monitored by continuously forecasting cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and
liabilities. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when
due and make value investments, under both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage
to the Group's reputation. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability
of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities, the spreading of debt maturities, and its credit standing in
capital markets.
The tables below analyse the Group's financial liabilities, excluding gross settled derivative financial liabilities, into relevant maturity
groupings based on the earliest possible contractual maturity date at year end. The amounts in the tables below are contractual
undiscounted cash flows, which include interest through to maturity. Perpetual Infratil Infrastructure Bonds cash flows have been
determined by reference to the longest dated Infratil bond maturity in the year 2029.

22.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and energy prices will affect the
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial assets and liabilities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
22.3.1 Interest rate risk (cash flow and fair value)
Interest rate risk is the risk of interest rate volatility negatively affecting the Group's interest expense cash flow and earnings. Infratil
mitigates this risk by issuing term borrowings at fixed interest rates and entering into Interest Rate Swaps to convert floating rate exposures
to fixed rate exposures. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk which is managed by the interest
rate repricing profile and hedging.
                                                                                                                         2021             2020

Assumptions used in the interest rate sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in interest rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of 100 basis
points higher/lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate the sensitivity of the Group to movements in interest rates. The sensitivity
was calculated by taking interest rate instruments including loans and borrowings, bonds, interest rate swaps and cross currency interest

22.3.2 Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk on the value of its net investment in foreign investments, assets and liabilities, future
investment obligations and future income. Foreign currency obligations and income are recognised as soon as the flow of funds is likely to
occur. Decisions on buying forward cover for likely foreign currency investments is subject to the Group’s expectation of the fair value of
the relevant exchange rate.
The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk from price fluctuations of foreign currency commitments
associated with the construction of generation assets and to hedge the risk of its net investment in foreign operations. Any resulting
differential to be paid or received as a result of the currency hedging of the asset is reflected in the final cost of the asset. The Group has
elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to these instruments.
The following table shows the impact on post-tax profit and equity if the New Zealand dollar had weakened or strengthened by
10 per cent against the currencies with which the Group has foreign currency risk with, all other variables held constant.

Assumptions used in the foreign currency exposure sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in foreign exchange rates were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of
plus or minus 10% has been applied to the AUD/NZD and USD/NZD exchange rates to demonstrate the sensitivity of foreign currency
risk of the company’s investment in foreign operations and associated derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity was calculated by
taking the AUD and USD spot rate as at balance date, moving this spot rate by plus and minus 10% and then reconverting the AUD
and USD balances with the ‘new spot-rate’.

Unhedged foreign currency exposures
At balance date the Group has the following unhedged exposure to foreign currency risk arising on foreign currency monetary assets
and liabilities that fall due within the next twelve months:
                                                                                                                           2021              2020

22.3.3 Energy price risk
Energy Price Risk is the risk that financial performance will be impacted by fluctuations in spot energy prices. The Group meets its energy sales
demand by purchasing energy on spot markets, physical deliveries and financial derivative contracts. This exposes the Group to fluctuations in
the spot and forward price of energy. The Group has entered into a number of energy hedge contracts to reduce the energy price risk from
price fluctuations. These hedge contracts establish the price at which future specified quantities of energy are purchased and settled. Any
resulting differential to be paid or received is recognised as a component of energy costs through the term of the contract. The Group has
elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to those instruments it deems material and which qualify as cash flow hedges.

Disclosures at 31 March 2021 exclude amounts relating to Tilt Renewables within assets held for sale.

                                                                                                                           2021              2020

At balance date the aggregate notional volume of outstanding energy derivatives were:
Electricity (GWh)                                                                                                      2,401.0           5,006.6

As at 31 March 2021, the Group had energy contracts outstanding with various maturities expected to occur continuously throughout the
next five years. The hedged anticipated energy purchase transactions are expected to occur continuously throughout the contract
period from balance sheet date consistent with the Group's forecast energy generation and retail energy sales. Gains and losses
recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve on energy derivatives as of 31 March 2021 will be continuously released to the income
statement in each period in which the underlying purchase transactions are recognised in the profit or loss.

Assumptions used in the energy forward price sensitivity analysis include:
Reasonably possible movements in energy forward prices were determined based on a review of historical movements. A movement of
10% higher/lower is considered appropriate to demonstrate sensitivity to movements in forward energy prices. The sensitivity was
calculated by taking balances that incorporate expectations of forward electricity prices at balance date and adjusting the forward
electricity price upwards and downwards to quantify the resulting impact to profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

22.4 Fair values

Estimation of fair values
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are
  determined with reference to quoted market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated using market-quoted rates based on discounted cash flow analysis.
• The fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made
  of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve or available forward price data for the duration of the instruments.

Where the fair value of a derivative is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the instrument, the two key
types of variables used by the valuation techniques are:
• forward price curve (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices); and
• discount rates.

The selection of variables requires significant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions in respect
of these variables that could be used in estimating the fair value of these derivatives. Maximum use is made of observable market data
when selecting variables and developing assumptions for the valuation techniques.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)

22.5 Risk Management Framework
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The
Group has established an Audit and Risk Committee for Infratil and each of its significant subsidiaries and associates with responsibilities
which include reviewing management practices in relation to identification and management of significant business risk areas and
regulatory compliance. The Group has developed a comprehensive, enterprise wide risk management framework. Management and
Boards throughout the Group participate in the identification, assessment and monitoring of new and existing risks. Particular attention is
given to strategic risks that could affect the Group. Management reports to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board on the relevant
risks and the controls and treatments for those risks.

22.6 Capital Management
The Group's capital includes share capital, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests of the Group. From time to time the
Group purchases its own shares on the market with the timing of these purchases dependent on market prices, an assessment of value
for shareholders and an available window to trade on the NZX. Primarily the shares are intended to be held as treasury stock and may
be reissued under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan or cancelled. During the year the Group did not buy back any shares (2020: 887,617
shares). The Company and the Group's borrowings are subject to certain compliance ratios in accordance with the facility agreements
or the trust deed applicable to the borrowings. During the year there have been no breaches in the compliance ratios (2020: nil).
The Group seeks to ensure that no more than 20% of its non-bank debt is maturing in any one year period, and to spread the maturities
of its bank debt facilities between one and five years. Discussions on refinancing of facilities will normally commence at least six months
before maturity. Facilities are maintained with A (2020: A) or above rated financial institutions, and with a minimum number of bank
counterparties to ensure diversification. The Group manages its interest rate profile so as to minimise value volatility. This means having
interest costs fixed for extended terms. At times when long rates appear to be unsustainably high, the profile may be shortened, and
when rates are low the profile may be lengthened.

27 Management fee to Morrison & Co Infrastructure Management Limited
The management fee to MCIM comprises a number of different components:
A New Zealand base management fee is paid on the 'New Zealand Company Value' at the rates of 1.125% p.a on New Zealand
Company value up to $50 million, 1.0% p.a on the New Zealand Company Value between $50 million and $150 million, and 0.80% p.a on
the New Zealand Company Value above $150 million. The New Zealand Company Value is:
• the Company's market capitalisation as defined in the management agreement (i.e. the aggregated market value of the Company's
  listed securities, being ordinary shares, partly paid shares and, Infratil Infrastructure bonds);
• plus the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries' net debt (excluding listed debt securities and the book value of the debt in any
  non-Australasian investments);
• minus the cost price of any non-Australasian investments; and,
• plus/minus an adjustment for foreign exchange gains or losses related to non-New Zealand investments.
An international fund management fee is paid at the rate of 1.50% p.a on:
• the cost price of any non-Australasian investments; and,
• the book value of the debt in any wholly owned non-Australasian investments.

28 International Portfolio Incentive fee
International Investments are eligible for International Portfolio incentive fees (‘Incentive fees’) under the Management Agreement
between MCIM and Infratil. The Agreement allows for incentives to be payable for performance in excess of a minimum hurdle of
12% p.a in three separate areas:
• Initial Incentive Fees;
• Annual Incentive Fees; and,
• Realised Incentive Fees.
To the extent that there are assets that meet these criterion, independent valuations are performed on the respective International
Investments to determine whether any Incentive Fees are payable.

International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee
International Investments become eligible for the Initial Incentive Fee assessment on the third balance date (31 March) that they have
been held continuously by the Company. All International Investments that are acquired in any one financial year are grouped together
for the purposes of the Initial Incentive Fee, and an Initial Incentive Fee is payable at 20% of the outperformance of those assets
against a benchmark of 12% p.a. after tax, compounding.
There were no International Investments eligible for the International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee as at 31 March 2021.
(31 March 2020: None).


122
International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee
Thereafter International Investments are grouped together, and an Annual Incentive Fee is payable at 20% of the outperformance of
those assets against the higher of, a benchmark of 12% p.a. after tax, relative to the most recent 31 March valuation, or cost.
The Company’s investments in CDC Data Centres, Longroad Energy, RetireAustralia, Tilt Renewables and ASIP are eligible for the
International Portfolio Annual Incentive fee assessment as at 31 March 2021 (31 March 2020: ASIP, RetireAustralia, CDC Data Centres,
Longroad Energy and Tilt Renewables).
Based on independent valuations obtained as at 31 March 2021, an Annual Incentive Fee of $223.1 million is payable to MCIM
(31 March 2020: $125.0 million).

International Portfolio Realised Incentive Fee
Realised Incentive Fees are payable on the realised gains from the sale or other realisation of International Investments at 20% of the
outperformance (since the last valuation date) against the higher of, a benchmark of 12% p.a. after tax, relative to the most recent
31 March valuation, or cost. No Realised Incentive Fees were payable as at 31 March 2020 or 31 March 2021.

All Incentive fees accrued in 2021 relate to the Annual Incentive Fee assessment. (2020: All incentive fees relate to the Annual incentive
fee assessment.)

Payment of Annual Incentive Fees
Any Annual Incentive Fee calculated in respect of a Financial Year is earned and paid in three annual instalments, with the second and
third instalments only being earned and payable if, at each relevant assessment date, the fair value of the relevant asset (including
distributions, if any) exceeds the greater of fair value or cost as at the 31 March for which the Incentive Fee was first calculated.

Acquisition of Pacific Radiology Group
On 29 April 2021 Infratil announced that it had executed a conditional agreement to acquire between 50.1% and 60% of Pacific
Radiology Group Limited ('Pacific Radiology'), a comprehensive Diagnostic Imaging business in New Zealand, from existing Doctor
shareholders. Infratil confirmed on 13 May 2021 that the acquisition is now unconditional and that completion of the acquisition is

as Infratil’s ownership interest will be between 53.5% and 58.5%, with voting governance rights consistent with its interest. Business
combination accounting for the acquisition will be applied based on the assets and liabilities of Pacific Radiology at the completion
date and is expected to give rise to goodwill.

             International Financial Reporting Standards.                                     information.




                      Basis for opinion
      We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (‘ISAs (NZ)’). We
      believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
      We are independent of the group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of
      Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (Including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the
      New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for
      Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
      Standards) (‘IESBA Code’), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
      requirements and the IESBA Code.
      Our responsibilities under ISAs (NZ) are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
      consolidated financial statements section of our report.
      Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to taxation services, audit of regulatory
      disclosures, other assurance engagements and other consultancy services. Subject to certain restrictions, partners
      and employees of our firm may also deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading
      activities of the business of the group. These matters have not impaired our independence as auditor of the group.
      The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the group.



                      Scoping
      The scope of our audit is designed to ensure that we perform adequate work to be able to give an opinion on the
      consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the significance and
      risk profile of each investment it owns, the group’s accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which
      the investments operates.

In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be
performed at the component level by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors operating under
our instruction.
A full scope audit was performed on the most significant investments for the group using component materialities
which were lower than group materiality. The component materiality took into account the size and the risk profile
of each component.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to
have in the audit work at those investments to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. We kept in regular
communication with component audit teams throughout the year with phone calls, discussions and written
instructions and ensured that the component audit teams had the appropriate skills and competencies which are
needed for the audit. We reviewed the work undertaken by component auditors in order to ensure the quality and
adequacy of their work.



           Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Materiality helped us to determine the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
and on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The materiality for the consolidated financial statements
as a whole was set at $40 million determined with reference to a benchmark of group total assets. We chose total
assets given the asset intensive nature of the group’s underlying investments and that this is a more stable and
relevant measure than a profit measure. Materiality represents 0.5% of the selected benchmark.



           Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
the consolidated financial statements in the current period. We summarise below those matters and our key audit
procedures to address those matters in order that the shareholders as a body may better understand the process
by which we arrived at our audit opinion. Our procedures were undertaken in the context of and solely for the
purpose of our statutory audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole and we do not express
discrete opinions on separate elements of the consolidated financial statements.

The key audit matter                                         How the matter was addressed in our audit

Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment
 As disclosed in note 14 of the financial statements, the group has property, plant and equipment of $3,239
 million (2020: $3,958 million), with renewable generation assets, land and civil works and buildings making up
 the majority of this balance. The group has a policy of recording classes of property, plant and equipment at
 cost less accumulated depreciation, or at valuation, with valuations undertaken at least every 5 years with a
 material change assessment carried out in the intervening years.

           Other information
The Directors, on behalf of the group, are responsible for the other information included in the entity’s Annual
Report. Other information includes the reports of the Chief Executive and the Chair, Infratil’s summary financial
information, and disclosures relating to strategy, corporate governance, Infratil’s businesses and statutory
information (on pages 1 to 69 and page 129 to 144). Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does
not cover any other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

                 Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial
      statements
      The Directors, on behalf of the company, are responsible for:

      — the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
          accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (being New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
          Reporting Standards);

      — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a consolidated set of financial statements
          that is fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and

      — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
          going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
          cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.



                 Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
                 statements
      Our objective is:

      — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
          material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and

      — to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
      Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
      with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
      Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
      could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
      consolidated financial statements.
