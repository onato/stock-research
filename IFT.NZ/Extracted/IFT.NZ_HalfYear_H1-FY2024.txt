Notes to the
Financial Statements
For the 6 months ended 30 September 2023




1 Accounting policies
Reporting Entity
Infratil Limited (‘the Company’) is a company domiciled in New Zealand and registered under the Companies Act 1993. The Company is listed on the
NZX Main Board (‘NZX’) and Australian Securities Exchange (‘ASX’), and is an FMC Reporting Entity in terms of Part 7 of the Financial Markets Conduct
Act 2013.

Basis of preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated half year financial statements (‘half year statements’) of Infratil Limited together with its subsidiaries and
associates (‘the Group’) have been prepared in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and comply with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting. These half year statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies stated in the published financial statements for
the year ended 31 March 2023 and should be read in conjunction with the previous annual report. No changes have been made from the accounting
policies used in the 31 March 2023 annual report, other than noted below, which can be obtained from Infratil’s registered office or www.infratil.com.
The presentation currency used in the preparation of these financial statements is New Zealand dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency.
Comparative figures have been restated where appropriate to ensure consistency with the current period.

International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2023.
The Group has adopted International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12 that were approved by the New Zealand Accounting
Standards in July 2023 and became effective 10 August 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax
accounting and require new disclosures in the annual financial statements relating to the Pillar Two Model Rules. The Group has applied the exception
with immediate effect. As no legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules had been enacted or substantively enacted at 31 March 2023 in any
jurisdiction in which the Group operates and, as such, no related deferred taxes were recognised at that date, the application of the exception has no
impact on the Group’s interim financial statements.


2 Nature of business
The Group owns and operates infrastructure businesses and investments in New Zealand, Australia, the United States, Asia, United Kingdom and Europe.
The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand. The address of its registered office is 5 Market Lane, Wellington,
New Zealand.
More information on the individual businesses that make up the Group is contained in Note 4 (Operating segments) and Note 5 (Investments in
associates) including the relative contributions to total revenue and expenses of the Group.

6 Acquisition of subsidiaries
6.1 One NZ
On 7 June 2023, Infratil announced that it had reached an agreement with Brookfield Asset Management (‘Brookfield’), to acquire Brookfield’s 49.95%
stake in ICN JV Investments Limited (‘One NZ’) for $1,800.0 million, increasing Infratil’s ownership from 49.95% to 99.90%. The completion of the
acquisition occurred on 15 June 2023. The $1,800.0 million was paid in cash and was allocated as $1,572.1 million consideration for the shares, and
$227.9 million for Brookfield’s portion of the shareholder loan receivable. The transaction completed on 15 June 2023, funded by existing cash reserves,
external debt funding, and an equity raise.
Prior to 15 June 2023, Infratil’s investment in One NZ was equity accounted under NZ IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. This was on
the basis that Infratil and Brookfield collectively controlled One NZ. As a result of Infratil’s increased ownership, Infratil is required to consolidated One NZ
from the acquisition date. As Infratil’s original stake in One NZ was acquired in May 2019, NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the acquisition
of Brookfield’s 49.95% stake is recognised as an acquisition achieved in stages (‘step acquisition’).
In a step acquisition, the fair value of the equity accounted investment in One NZ that Infratil held immediately before obtaining control is used in the
determination of goodwill that will be recognised by Infratil on acquisition of the controlling share in One NZ. This treatment effectively considers that the
49.95% of the investment in One NZ that was held by Infratil, before obtaining control, is sold, and a 99.90% controlling interest in a subsidiary has been
purchased. The fair value of the initial 49.95% has been calculated as $1,235.3 million by discounting the price paid for the controlling interest with
observed market control premiums. As of 14 June 2023, the carrying value of Infratil’s investment in One NZ was $170.8 million. Comparing the carrying
value of Infratil’s investment immediately before obtaining control to the fair value results in a gain on acquisition of $1,064.5 million.
NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination are measured at fair value
at the date of acquisition, with any deficit between the consideration paid (including the previously held equity investment at fair value) and the value of
the net identifiable assets (or liabilities) acquired and any non-controlling interest, recognised as goodwill, with any gain recognised through profit & loss.
The acquisition accounting required under NZ IFRS 3 has not been finalised as at 30 September 2023, and therefore the amounts recorded in the
financial statements are reported as provisional. This primarily relates to the requirement that the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a
business combination are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition, as well as any other identified intangible assets. An independent valuer has
been appointed to perform this exercise. If this exercise identifies any adjustments to the provisional amounts, or if new information obtained within one
year of the date of acquisition (about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition) identifies adjustments to the provisional amounts,
or any additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition are discovered, then the acquisition accounting will be revised. The identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired as part of the business combination are summarised on the next page.

For the four months ended 30 September 2023, One NZ contributed revenue of $664.2 million and net profit after tax of $16.2 million. If the acquisition
had occurred on 1 April 2023, management estimates that consolidated revenue and net profit after tax would have been $976.6 million and a profit of
$6.4 million, respectively. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the measurement adjustments, determined provisionally, that
arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2023.
Acquisition costs relating to the transaction of $1.0 million were recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 6 months to
30 September 2023.

6.2 Console Connect
On 10 July 2023, Infratil executed a conditional agreement to acquire 80% of Console Connect from Hong Kong Telecommunications (‘HKT’) for
US$160.0 million. Console Connect is leading telecommunications company in Hong Kong. The initial acquisition by Infratil of 80% of Console Connect
is step-one of a two-step process, with HKT subsidiary PCCW Global retaining a put option to sell its enterprise and wholesale business to Console
Connect as step-two of the process. Step two of the process would involve the issue of shares in Console Connect to HKT in consideration for the
acquisition of PCCW’s enterprise and wholesale business. At the culmination of this transaction, Infratil would own no less than 60% of the equity of
Console Connect.
The Group will fund the acquisition through existing bank loan facilities. Drawdown is contingent on completion of the acquisition. Completion of the
acquisition is conditional on telecommunication, foreign investment regulatory approvals and merger approvals in Australia, France, Germany, Greece,
Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, and the USA. Assuming those approvals are granted, completion is
currently expected by Q3 2024. As such the acquisition remains incomplete at the date of signing the accounts.

The Group operates in various jurisdictions some of which have enacted or substantively enacted tax legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules.
However, as the application of the Pillar Two Model Rules in respect of those judications will not apply to the financial reporting period ended 31 March
2024, there is no current tax impact in the period ended 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: nil, 31 March 2023: nil). The Group has applied a
temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting in respect of the Pillar Two Model Rules and will account for it as a current tax arising under the
Pillar Tax Model rules when it is incurred (see Note 1).

Financing arrangements
Wholly owned subsidiaries
Infratil Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank facility arrangements with a negative pledge agreement,
which, with limited exceptions does not permit the Infratil Guaranteeing Group (‘IGG’) to grant any security over its assets. The IGG comprises entities
subject to a cross guarantee and comprises Infratil Limited, Infratil Finance Limited and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries. These facilities are
primarily used to fund the corporate and investment activities of the Company. The IGG does not incorporate the underlying assets of the Company’s
non-wholly owned subsidiaries and associates. The IGG bank facilities also include restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank
agreement. Liability under the cross guarantee is limited to the amount of debt drawn under the IGG facilities, plus any unpaid interest and costs of
recovery.
At 30 September 2023 there was $635.0 million of drawn debt or accrued interest payable under the IGG facilities (30 September 2022: nil,
31 March 2023: nil) and undrawn IGG facilities totalled $1,010.0 million (30 September 2022: $910.8 million, 31 March 2023: $898.4 million).
Non-wholly owned subsidiaries
The Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries also enter into bank facility arrangements. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are included within
loans and borrowings in the table above. Wellington International Airport and Manawa Energy’s facilities are both subject to negative pledge
arrangements, which with limited exceptions does not permit those entities to grant security over their respective assets. One NZ, Qscan Group and
RHCNZ Medical Imaging borrow under syndicated bank debt facilities, under which security is granted over their respective assets. All non-wholly owned
subsidiary facilities are subject to restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement.
The various bank facilities across the Group require the relevant borrowing group to operate within defined performance and gearing ratios as is typical of
debt facilities of this nature. Throughout the period the Group has complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by the respective lenders.
Interest rates
Interest rates payable on bank loan facilities are floating rate determined by reference to prevailing money market rates at the time of draw-down plus a
margin. Interest rates paid during the period ranged from 4.96% to 9.24% (30 September 2022: 0.56% to 7.04%, 31 March 2023: 1.40% to 8.44%).

11 Financial instruments
11.1 Fair values
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at their fair value, with the exception of bond debt and senior notes which are measured at
amortised cost. The bond debt and senior notes have a fair value at 30 September 2023 of $2,331.4 million (30 September 2022: $2,386.4 million,
31 March 2023: $2,264.1 million) compared to an amortised cost value of $2,463.1 million (30 September 2022: $2,493.4 million, 31 March 2023:
$2,383.7 million).

11.2 Estimation of fair values
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference
  to quoted market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated using market-quoted rates based on discounted cash flow analysis.
• The fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted
  cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve or available forward price data for the duration of the instruments.
Where the fair value of a derivative is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the instrument, the two key types of variables
used in the valuation techniques are:
• forward price curve (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices); and
• discount rates.

The selection of variables requires significant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions in respect of these variables
that could be used in estimating the fair value of these derivatives. Maximum use is made of observable market data when selecting variables and
developing assumptions for the valuation techniques.

11.3 Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly
  (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3)
The following tables present the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

11.4 Energy derivatives
Energy Price Risk is the risk that financial performance will be impacted by fluctuations in spot energy prices. The Group meets its energy sales demand
by purchasing energy on spot markets, physical deliveries and financial derivative contracts. This exposes the Group to fluctuations in the spot and
forward price of energy. The Group has entered into a energy hedge contract to reduce the energy price risk from price fluctuations. This hedge contract
establishes the price at which future specified quantities of energy are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be paid or received is
recognised as a component of energy costs through the term of the contract. The Group has elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to those
instruments it deems material and which qualify as a cash flow hedge.
At the time of the sale of the Trustpower Retail business to Mercury Energy (‘Mercury’), Mercury and Manawa signed a pre-agreed electricity price
contract for differences, under which Manawa will supply electricity to Mercury. Manawa and Mercury entered into this electricity price derivative on
2 May 2022, which on day 1 had a negative value of $521.8 million which was deferred as per NZ IFRS 9.
During the current period $77.6 million (cumulative to date: $199.7 million) of the deferred day 1 value has been recognised through wholesale
electricity revenue as the calibrated CFD cash flows have been realised throughout the period. These CFD cash settlements have reduced the impact of
changes in wholesale electricity prices on Manawa Energy’s revenue. A current period fair value gain of $54.9 million (September 2022: $7.2 million) has
been recognised with $52.5 million (September 2022: $7.2 million) taken to the cash flow hedge reserve and $2.4 million (September 2022: nil) taken to
net fair value gains on derivatives. The fair value of this electricity price derivative at 30 September 2023 is $152.3 million (31 March 2023: $97.4 million)
with a cumulative amount of $80.3 million taken to the cashflow hedge reserve.

International Portfolio Incentive Fees
International Investments are eligible for International Portfolio incentive fees (‘Incentive fees’) under the Management Agreement between MCIM and
Infratil. The Agreement allows for incentives to be payable for performance in excess of a minimum hurdle of 12% per annum in three separate areas:
• Initial Incentive Fees;
• Annual Incentive Fees; and,
• Realised Incentive Fees.
To the extent that there are assets that meet these criterion, independent valuations are performed on the respective International Investments to
determine whether any Incentive Fees are payable.
International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee
The Company’s investments in Kao Data and Gurīn Energy are eligible for the International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee assessment as at 31 March 2024
(31 March 2023: Qscan Group). No International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee has been accrued as at 30 September 2023.
International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee
The Company’s investments in CDC Data Centres, Galileo, Longroad Energy, RetireAustralia and Qscan Group are eligible for the International Portfolio
Annual Incentive fee assessment as at 31 March 2024 (31 March 2023: CDC Data Centres, Galileo, Longroad Energy, RetireAustralia).
As at 30 September 2023, it is probable that Infratil will have an International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee (for the year to 31 March 2024) due to MCIM
based on the performance of the above portfolio of assets, and as a result an amount of $37.3 million has been provided for as at 30 September 2023
(30 September 2022: $124.2 million, 31 March 2023: $169.6 million).

Payment of Annual Incentive Fees
Any Annual Incentive Fee calculated in respect of a Financial Year is earned and paid in three annual instalments, with the second and third instalments
being scaled down if the fair value of the relevant asset (including distributions, if any) is less than fair value or cost as at the 31 March for which the
Incentive Fee was first calculated.
International Portfolio Realised Incentive Fee
There were no divestments of the Company’s investment during the period to 30 September 2023 that resulted in an accrual of a realised incentive fee
(30 September 2022: nil, 31 March 2023: nil).
More detail on how Management fees are calculated is included in Infratil’s Annual Report.


16 Contingent liabilities and legal matters
The Company and certain wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors of the bank debt facilities of Infratil Finance Limited under a Deed of Negative Pledge,
Guarantee and Subordination and the Company is a guarantor to certain obligations of subsidiary companies.


17 Events after balance date

   attention that causes us to believe that the interim                                    interim consolidated financial statements which
   consolidated financial statements on pages 9 to 45                                      comprise:

                                                                                                 information.




                   Basis for conclusion
A review of interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 Review of Financial
Statements Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“NZ SRE 2410”) is a limited assurance
engagement. The auditor performs procedures, consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
As the auditor of Infratil Limited, NZ SRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to
the audit of the annual financial statements.
Our firm has also provided other services to the group in relation to advisory services for a Māori culture capability
assessment, climate related assurance, taxation services, audit of regulatory disclosures and other assurance
engagements. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and employees of our firm may also deal with the group on
normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the group. These matters have not
impaired our independence as reviewer of the group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the
group.




                   Use of this Independent Review Report
This report is made solely to the shareholders as a body. Our review work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in the Independent Review Report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the shareholders as a body for our review work, this report, or any of the opinions we have formed.

           Responsibilities of the Directors for the interim
     financial statements
     The Directors, on behalf of the company, are responsible for:
     — the preparation and fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ
         IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting;
     — implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a interim consolidated financial
         statements that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
     — assessing the ability to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related
         to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate or to
         cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.




           Auditor’s Responsibilities for the review of the interim
     financial statements
     Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review. We conducted
     our review in accordance with NZ SRE 2410. NZ SRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come
     to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all
     material respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
     The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in
     accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Accordingly, we do not express an audit
     opinion on these interim consolidated financial statements.
     This description forms part of our Independent Review Report.
