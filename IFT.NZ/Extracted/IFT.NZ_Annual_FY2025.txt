     DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE




SCALING THROUGH
                              As AI, cloud, and cybersecurity reshape global computing, the demand for high-performance digital infrastructure
                              continues to accelerate. Infratil’s digital infrastructure platforms - CDC, One NZ, and Kao Data - are being built today
                              for what is coming tomorrow.


THE NOISE                     As headlines focus on AI cycles and hyperscaler sentiment, digital demand continues to grow. The need for secure,
                              scalable infrastructure has never been greater. Infratil’s digital investments are positioned at the heart of this
                              transformation. By investing with conviction and clarity, we are building platforms that will endure long after the
                              noise subsides.

CONVICTION IN
                  Demand for electricity is growing - and renewables are poised to play a central role in meeting this demand
                  sustainably. Even as global trade tensions, tariff shifts, and policy uncertainty create near-term noise, the long-term
                  trajectory for the sector remains unchanged.


CLEAN ENERGY      Infratil’s renewables strategy is grounded in long-term conviction: that decarbonisation, electrification, and energy
                  security will drive investment for decades. We back platforms that are building and operating the infrastructure
                  needed to power this transition. Across geographies and technologies, our focus remains on disciplined growth,
                  quality execution, and the creation of long-term value in an evolving energy landscape.

Management has considered if it controls Kao Data given the 54.0% shareholding. Based on the operational structure of Kao Data the Group does not
control Kao Data under IFRS 10 therefore will continue to equity-account for the investment given the assessment of significant influence is met.

Infratil recognises the importance of assessing and mitigating climate-related risks across its portfolio companies. As a responsible investor in
infrastructure assets, Infratil acknowledges the potential impacts of climate change on its portfolio and is committed to taking proactive measures to
address these risks.                                                                                                                                                The uncalled commitment at 31 March 2024: $526.5 million. Infratil’s shareholding allows it to control the timing and quantum of any capital call.

Assessment of Climate Risks
Infratil has conducted a thorough assessment of climate-related risks across its portfolio, considering both physical risks and transition risks associated with
climate change.
As of 1 April 2023, the Group is a Climate Reporting Entity for the purpose of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (’FMCA’). On 30 July 2024, Infratil
released its first mandatory Climate Related Disclosures, covering the FY2024 period. Further information on the Group’s response to climate-related risks
and disclosures is available here https://infratil.com/for-investors/sustainability-reporting. Infratil will release its FY2025 mandatory Climate Risk Disclosure
report by 31 July 2025.
The Group reviews its investments against independent external valuation reports to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. Independent external valuations also form the basis for the International Portfolio Incentive Fees paid to Morrison annually. The
valuers have considered the impact of climate change on the investments but have made no explicit adjustments in respect of climate change matters.
However, the Group and valuers anticipate that climate change could have a greater influence on valuations in the future as investment markets place a
greater emphasis on this topic.
