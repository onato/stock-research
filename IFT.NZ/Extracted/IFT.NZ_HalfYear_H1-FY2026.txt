NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the 6 months ended 30 September 2025


(1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES
REPORTING ENTITY
Infratil Limited (‘the Company‘) is a company domiciled in New Zealand and registered under the Companies Act 1993. The Company is listed on the NZX
Main Board (‘NZX‘) and Australian Securities Exchange (‘ASX‘), and is an FMC Reporting Entity in terms of Part 7 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
These unaudited condensed consolidated half year financial statements ('half year statements') of Infratil Limited together with its subsidiaries and associates
('the Group') have been prepared in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and comply with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. These half year
statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies stated in the published financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 and
should be read in conjunction with the previous annual report. No changes have been made from the accounting policies used in the 31 March 2025 annual
report, which can be obtained from Infratil's registered office or www.infratil.com. The presentation currency used in the preparation of these financial
statements is New Zealand dollars, which is also the Company's functional currency.

RESTATEMENT OF INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES
During the period ended 31 March 2025, CDC reviewed the accounting classification of management shares, which resulted in a revision to their historical
treatment. Accordingly, a restatement has been made to reflect this adjustment as at 30 September 2024.
Due to the option available to employees to put shares to CDC under certain schemes, which, if exercised, would require CDC to repurchase its own shares,
it was determined that these instruments should be classified as a liability rather than as share capital and remeasured at each reporting date.
The following tables summarise the impacts on the Group's consolidated financial statements for 30 September 2024.

NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND PRONOUNCEMENT NOT YET ADOPTED BY THE GROUP
IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 and applies retrospectively. The new
standard aims to provide greater consistency in presentation of the income and cash flow statements, and more disaggregated information. While this will not
have a material impact on the results of the Group, it will result in significant changes to how the Group presents the income statement and what information will
need to be disclosed on management defined performance measures.

(6) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
(6.1) MANAWA ENERGY
On 7 May 2025, the New Zealand Commerce Commission (’NZCC’) granted Contact Energy (’Contact’) clearance to acquire all the shares in Manawa Energy
(’Manawa’) under the Scheme of Arrangement (’Scheme’) that was announced on 11 September 2024. On 11 July 2025, the acquisition of Manawa
by Contact was completed. The Group's 51.1% stake in Manawa was acquired for gross proceeds of $1,022.4 million comprising cash consideration of
$179.2 million and shares in Contact valued at $843.2 million on completion date. The gain on sale was $272.6 million after transaction costs.
As the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in Manawa has been recovered through the sale transaction, the investment in Manawa has been classified
as a discontinued operation from 11 July 2025. The comparative consolidated statement of comprehensive income and respective notes have been restated
to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. The results from discontinued operations are presented separately below.

(6.2) INFRATIL INFRASTRUCTURE PROPERTY
In June 2022, the Infratil Infrastructure Property Limited (‘IIPL‘) Board approved the marketing of IIPL‘s investment property at 100 Halsey Street (‘Wynyard 100‘)
for a potential sale. The sales process remained ongoing at 30 September 2025. As such, the investment property at 100 Halsey Street is deemed to be held
for sale at 30 September 2025. Included in assets and liabilities held for sale are investment property ($54.8 million), right of use assets ($70.1 million) and
lease liabilities ($69.0 million).
At 30 September 2025, the investment property at 100 Halsey Street is not deemed to be a discontinued operation as it does not represent a separate major
line of business or geographic area of operation for the Group.

(6.3) RETIREAUSTRALIA
In August 2025, Infratil and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund announced a binding agreement to sell RetireAustralia to Invesco, subject to the satisfaction
of a limited number of conditions. As at 30 September 2025, the transaction had not completed but remained on track to settle in the final quarter of the 2025
calendar year.
At 30 September 2025, the sale of RetireAustralia was assessed as highly probable. Accordingly, the investment was classified as held-for-sale. This resulted in
the discontinuation of equity accounting and the investment being measured at fair value. Fair value was determined based on the expected final sale proceeds
at period end.
On completion, Infratil expects to receive proceeds of approximately A$290 million (NZ$331 million) after transaction costs, with final proceeds to be adjusted
for customary completion adjustments.

International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules
The Group is within the scope of the Organisation for Economic Co-operations and Development‘s Pillar Two Model Rules. In late March 2024, Pillar Two
legislation was enacted in New Zealand, being the jurisdiction in which the group parent entity (Infratil Limited) is incorporated, and came into effect for the
Group from 1 April 2025. For some entities within the Group (that are located in other jurisdictions with earlier adoption), the Pillar Two rules came into effect
from 1 April 2024 and have a current tax impact for the current reporting period.
Under the Pillar Two Model Rules the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax if the effective tax rate (calculated by a jurisdiction) is below the 15% minimum tax rate
as calculated under the Pillar Two legislation. The Group‘s assessment of its potential exposure to date, which has included an analysis of the application of the
transitional safe harbour rules for all jurisdictions, was based on the Group‘s 31 March 2025 year end information. This assessment indicates that for that period,
if the Pillar Two Model Rules had been in effect, no top-up tax would have arisen for the Group‘s operations and therefore there is no current tax impact. The
Group is not expecting this position to change going forward but will continue to monitor and assess the potential impact on the Group.
The Group has applied temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting in respect of Pillar Two Model Rules and will account for this as a current tax
when it is incurred (where relevant).

On 11 July 2025, as part consideration for Contact Energy’s ('Contact') acquisition of Manawa Energy, Infratil received 93.3 million Contact shares with a fair
value of $843.2 million at the transaction date. Infratil has elected to measure its investment in Contact at fair value through other comprehensive income

$5.6 million has been recognised in other comprehensive income. In addition, a dividend of $21.5 million was recognised in profit or loss during the period

US$50 million were made in May 2020 and May 2022 respectively bringing Infratil‘s total commitments to US$100 million. The strategic objective of the
investment is to help Infratil‘s businesses identify and engage with technology changes that will impact their activities. As at 30 September 2025, Infratil has
made total contributions of US$64.7 million (30 September 2024: $60.7 million, 31 March 2025: $62.7 million), with the remaining US$35.3 million
commitment uncalled at that date.

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Wholly owned subsidiaries
Infratil Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank facility arrangements with a negative pledge agreement, which, with
limited exceptions does not permit the Infratil Guaranteeing Group (‘IGG‘) to grant any security over its assets. The IGG comprises entities subject to a cross
guarantee and comprises Infratil Limited, Infratil Finance Limited and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries. These facilities are primarily used to fund the
corporate and investment activities of the Company. The IGG does not incorporate the underlying assets of the Company‘s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and
associates. The IGG bank facilities also include restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement. Liability under the cross
guarantee is limited to the amount of debt drawn under the IGG facilities, plus any unpaid interest and costs of recovery.
At 30 September 2025 there was $922.8 million of drawn debt under the IGG facilities (30 September 2024: nil, 31 March 2025: $616.6 million) and
undrawn IGG facilities totalled $1,083.6 million (30 September 2024: $1,561.8 million, 31 March 2025: $1,365.7 million).

Non-wholly owned subsidiaries
The Group‘s non-wholly owned subsidiaries also enter into bank facility arrangements. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are included within loans and
borrowings in the table above. Wellington International Airport‘s facilities are subject to negative pledge arrangements which, with limited exceptions, does not
permit those entities to grant security over their respective assets. One NZ, Qscan Group and RHCNZ Medical Imaging borrow under syndicated bank debt
facilities, under which security is granted over their respective assets. All non-wholly owned subsidiary facilities are subject to restrictions over the sale or
disposal of certain assets without bank agreement.
The various bank facilities across the Group require the relevant borrowing group to operate within defined performance and gearing ratios as is typical of debt
facilities of this nature. Throughout the period the Group has complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by the respective lenders.

Interest rates
Interest rates payable on bank loan facilities are floating rate determined by reference to prevailing money market rates at the time of draw-down plus a margin.
Interest rates paid during the period ranged from 4.05% to 7.91% (30 September 2024: 6.45% to 8.98%, 31 March 2025: 4.64% to 8.98%).

IFT320 bonds for the period from (but excluding) 15 June 2026 until the maturity date will be the sum of the four year swap rate on 15 June 2026 plus a margin
of 2.00% per annum.

Perpetual Infratil infrastructure bonds (‘PIIBs‘)
The Company has 231,917,000 (30 September 2024: 231,917,000, 31 March 2025: 231,917,000) PIIBs on issue at a face value of $1.00 per bond. Interest
is payable quarterly on the bonds. On 15 November 2024 the coupon was set at 5.51% per annum until the next reset date, being 15 November 2025
(September 2024: 7.06%, March 2025: 5.51%). Thereafter the rate will be reset annually at 1.50% per annum over the then one year swap rate for quarterly
payments, unless Infratil‘s gearing ratio exceeds certain thresholds, in which case the margin increases. These infrastructure bonds have no fixed maturity date.
Throughout the period the Company complied with all debt covenants relating to its Bonds on issue.
At 30 September 2025 Infratil Infrastructure bonds (including PIIBs) had a fair value of $1,703.1 million (30 September 2024: $1,554.0 million, 31 March
2025: $1,572.6 million).


(12) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(12.1) FAIR VALUES
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at their fair value, with the exception of bond debt and senior notes which are measured at amortised cost.
The bond debt and senior notes have a fair value at 30 September 2025 of $2,476.2 million (30 September 2024: $2,629.4 million, 31 March 2025:
$2,663.4 million) compared to an amortised cost value of $2,457.9 million (30 September 2024: $2,656.8 million, 31 March 2025: $2,692.2 million).

(12.2) ESTIMATION OF FAIR VALUES
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted
  market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated using market-quoted rates based on discounted cash flow analysis.
• The fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow
  analysis using the applicable yield curve or available forward price data for the duration of the instruments.
Where the fair value of a derivative is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the instrument, the two key types of variables used in
the valuation techniques are:
• forward price curve (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices); and
• discount rates.

The selection of variables requires significant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions in respect of these variables that
could be used in estimating the fair value of these derivatives. Maximum use is made of observable market data when selecting variables and developing
assumptions for the valuation techniques.

(12.3) FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly
  (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3)
The following tables present the Group‘s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

(18) EVENTS AFTER BALANCE DATE
Dividend
On 12 November 2025, the Directors approved a partially imputed interim dividend of 7.25 cents per share to holders of fully paid ordinary shares to be paid on
16 December 2025.

Acquisition of an additional 4.92% interest in Contact Energy
On 20 October 2025, Infratil agreed to acquire an additional 4.92% interest in Contact Energy from TECT Holdings for a total consideration of $437.7 million.
The consideration comprises $218.8 million funded from newly committed acquisition debt facilities and $218.8 million satisfied through the issuance of new
Infratil shares to TECT at an issue price of $12.43 per share.
Following completion of the transaction on 21 October 2025, Infratil’s ownership in Contact increased to 14.3%.

Fortysouth Sale
Infratil entered into a conditional agreement on 10 November 2025 to sell its 20% shareholding in Fortysouth to InfraRed Capital Partners and Pantheon. The
sale proceeds are expected to be more than $200.0 million, and we currently anticipate the difference between the carrying value and total consideration to
result in a gain on sale. The final amount is subject to the timing of settlement, with the transaction conditional only on Overseas Investment Office approval.

     Basis for conclusion
     We conducted our review of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410
     (Revised) Review of Financial Statements Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (NZ SRE 2410
     (Revised)). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the review of the interim
     consolidated financial statements section of our report.

     We are independent of Infratil Limited in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in New Zealand
     relating to the audit of the annual financial statements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
     accordance with these ethical requirements.

     Our firm has provided other services to the Group in relation to climate related assurance, agreed upon
     procedures, taxation services and other assurance and advisory engagements. Subject to certain restrictions,
     partners and employees of our firm may also deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of
     trading activities of the business of the Group. These matters have not impaired our independence as auditor of
     the Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

Use of this Independent Auditor’s Review Report
This report is made solely to the shareholders. Our review work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in the Independent Auditor’s Review Report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the shareholders for our review work, this report, or any of the conclusions we have formed.



Responsibilities of directors for the interim consolidated financial
statements
The directors, on behalf of the Group are responsible for:

         the preparation and fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with
         NZ IAS 34; and

         such internal control, as the directors determine is necessary, to enable the preparation of interim
         consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
         error.



Auditor's responsibilities for the review of the interim consolidated
financial statements
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements based on our
review.

NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the interim consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34.

A review of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited
assurance engagement. The auditor performs procedures, consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the interim consolidated financial statements.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Ed Louden.
