Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the 6 months ended 30 September 2024




(1) Accounting policies
Reporting Entity
Infratil Limited ('the Company') is a company domiciled in New Zealand and registered under the Companies Act 1993. The Company is listed on the NZX
Main Board ('NZX') and Australian Securities Exchange ('ASX'), and is an FMC Reporting Entity in terms of Part 7 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.

Basis of preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated half year financial statements ('half year statements') of Infratil Limited together with its subsidiaries and
associates ('the Group') have been prepared in accordance with NZ IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and comply with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
These half year statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies stated in the published financial statements for the year ended
31 March 2024 and should be read in conjunction with the previous annual report. No changes have been made from the accounting policies used in the
31 March 2024 annual report, other than noted below, which can be obtained from Infratil's registered office or www.infratil.com. The presentation
currency used in the preparation of these financial statements is New Zealand dollars, which is also the Company's functional currency.
Comparative figures have been restated where appropriate to ensure consistency with the current period.
Restatement of Longroad Energy Share Class
Longroad Energy has three share classes (A, B, and C). The Class B shares issued at inception to Longroad Energy employees and the associated cash
incentive allocations have been restated in prior periods to a NZ IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability, from equity, as part of a review to translate accounting
policies from US GAAP to NZ IFRS for Infratil’s equity accounting. These instruments do not give holders a residual interest in the net assets of Longroad
Energy and include other liability characteristics, such as non-discretionary distributions. The Class C shares created as part of the Class B incentive
allocations, have also been restated to a liability from equity, as a cash settled share-based payment under NZ IFRS 2, as part of the review. Infratil is a Class
A shareholder, and this forms the basis of the Company’s equity accounted investment in Longroad Energy. This is an accounting classification change with
the economic substance of the share classes remaining unchanged.
The restatement impacts the Share of Earnings of Associate Companies and Other Comprehensive Income within the Statement of Comprehensive
Income, and the Investment in Associates within the Statement of Financial Position. There is also a restatement within equity between Retained Earnings
and Other Reserves. The following tables summarise the impacts on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules
The Group is within the scope of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Pillar Two Model Rules. In late March 2024, Pillar Two
legislation was enacted in New Zealand, being the jurisdiction in which the group parent entity (Infratil Limited) is incorporated, and will come into effect for
the Group from 1 April 2025. For some entities within the Group (that are located in other jurisdictions with earlier adoption), the Pillar Two rules could come
into effect from 1 April 2024 and have a current tax impact for the current reporting period.
Under the Pillar Two Model Rules the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax if the effective tax rate (calculated by jurisdiction) is below the 15% minimum tax rate
as calculated under the Pillar Two legislation. The Group's assessment of its potential exposure to date, which has included an analysis of the application of
the transitional safe harbour rules for all jurisdictions, was based on the Group's 31 March 2024 year end information. This assessment indicates that for
that period, if the Pillar Two Model Rules had been in effect, no top-up tax would have arisen for the Group's operations and therefore there is no current tax
impact. The Group is not expecting this position to change going forward but will continue to monitor and assess the potential impact on the Group.
The Group has applied temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting in respect of the Pillar Two Model Rules and will account for this as a
current tax when it is incurred (where relevant).

Financing arrangements
Wholly owned subsidiaries
Infratil Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into bank facility arrangements with a negative pledge agreement, which,
with limited exceptions does not permit the Infratil Guaranteeing Group (‘IGG’) to grant any security over its assets. The IGG comprises entities subject to a
cross guarantee and comprises Infratil Limited, Infratil Finance Limited and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries. These facilities are primarily used to
fund the corporate and investment activities of the Company. The IGG does not incorporate the underlying assets of the Company’s non-wholly owned
subsidiaries and associates. The IGG bank facilities also include restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement. Liability
under the cross guarantee is limited to the amount of debt drawn under the IGG facilities, plus any unpaid interest and costs of recovery.
At 30 September 2024 there was no drawn debt or accrued interest payable under the IGG facilities (30 September 2023: $635.0 million, 31 March
2024: $811.0 million) and undrawn IGG facilities totalled $1,561.8 million (30 September 2023: $1,010.0 million, 31 March 2024: $800.9 million).

Non-wholly owned subsidiaries
The Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries also enter into bank facility arrangements. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are included within loans
and borrowings in the table above. Wellington International Airport and Manawa Energy’s facilities are both subject to negative pledge arrangements, which
with limited exceptions does not permit those entities to grant security over their respective assets. One NZ, Qscan Group and RHCNZ Medical Imaging
borrow under syndicated bank debt facilities, under which security is granted over their respective assets. All non-wholly owned subsidiary facilities are
subject to restrictions over the sale or disposal of certain assets without bank agreement.
The various bank facilities across the Group require the relevant borrowing group to operate within defined performance and gearing ratios as is typical of
debt facilities of this nature. Throughout the period the Group has complied with all debt covenant requirements as imposed by the respective lenders.

Interest rates
Interest rates payable on bank loan facilities are floating rate determined by reference to prevailing money market rates at the time of draw-down plus a
margin. Interest rates paid during the period ranged from 6.45% to 8.98% (30 September 2023: 4.96% to 9.24%, 31 March 2024: 6.15% to 9.24%).

bond. Interest is payable quarterly on the bonds. On 15 November 2023 the coupon was set at 7.06% per annum until the next reset date, being
15 November 2024 (September 2023: 6.45%, March 2024: 7.06%). Thereafter the rate will be reset annually at 1.50% per annum over the then one
year swap rate for quarterly payments, unless Infratil's gearing ratio exceeds certain thresholds, in which case the margin increases. These infrastructure
bonds have no fixed maturity date.
Throughout the period the Company complied with all debt covenants relating to its Bonds on issue.
At 30 September 2024 Infratil Infrastructure bonds (including PIIBs) had a fair value of $1,554.0 million (30 September 2023: $1,353.7 million,
31 March 2024: $1,363.1 million).

(12.1) Fair values
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at their fair value, with the exception of bond debt and senior notes which are measured at amortised
cost. The bond debt and senior notes have a fair value at 30 September 2024 of $2,629.4 million (30 September 2023: $2,331.4 million, 31 March 2024:
$2,470.6 million) compared to an amortised cost value of $2,656.7 million (30 September 2023: $2,463.1 million, 31 March 2024: $2,569.5 million).

(12.2) Estimation of fair values
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to
  quoted market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated using market-quoted rates based on discounted cash flow analysis.
• The fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash
  flow analysis using the applicable yield curve or available forward price data for the duration of the instruments.
Where the fair value of a derivative is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the instrument, the two key types of variables
used in the valuation techniques are:
• forward price curve (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices); and
• discount rates.

The selection of variables requires significant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions in respect of these variables
that could be used in estimating the fair value of these derivatives. Maximum use is made of observable market data when selecting variables and
developing assumptions for the valuation techniques.

(12.3) Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly
  (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3)
The following tables present the Group's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

(12.4) Manawa Energy energy derivatives
Energy Price Risk is the risk that financial performance will be impacted by fluctuations in spot energy prices. Manawa Energy meets its energy sales
demand by purchasing energy on spot markets, physical deliveries and financial derivative contracts. This exposes the Group to fluctuations in the spot
and forward price of energy. Manawa Energy has entered into a energy hedge contract to reduce the energy price risk from price fluctuations. This hedge
contract establishes the price at which future specified quantities of energy are purchased and settled. Any resulting differential to be paid or received is
recognised as a component of energy costs through the term of the contract. The Group has elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting to those
instruments it deems material and which qualify as a cash flow hedge.
Electricity price CFD entered with Mercury NZ Limited
Manawa Energy and Mercury NZ Limited entered into an electricity price derivative on 2 May 2022. The electricity price CFD entered with Mercury NZ
Limited was transferred at a price of $1 as part of the sale of the Trustpower mass market retail business. When valued against the wholesale
electricity price curve, on day 1 this had a negative value of $521.7 million which was deferred as per NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The day 1
loss of $521.7 million is recognised in wholesale electricity revenue as the contractual cash flows on the swap are settled and fair value gains/losses
on the calibrated swap are realised over time.
During the period $75.1 million (cumulative to date: $327.0 million) of the deferred day 1 value has been recognised through wholesale electricity revenue
as the calibrated CFD cash flows have been realised throughout the period. These CFD cash settlements have reduced the impact of changes in wholesale
electricity prices on Manawa Energy's revenue.
A current period fair value loss of $26.9 million (30 September 2023: $54.9 million gain, 31 March 2024: $69.6 million loss), over the period from 1 April
2024 to 30 September 2024, has been recognised with $26.9 million (30 September 2023: $52.5 million, 31 March 2024: $nil) taken to the cash flow
hedge reserve and $nil (30 September 2023: $2.4 million, 31 March 2024: $69.6 million) taken to net fair value gains on financial instruments. The fair
value of this electricity price derivative at 30 September 2024 is a $30.6 million liability (30 September 2023: $152.3 million asset, 31 March 2024:
$3.7 million liability).

International Portfolio Incentive Fees
International Investments are eligible for International Portfolio incentive fees (‘Incentive fees’) under the Management Agreement between
Morrison and Infratil. The Agreement allows for incentives to be payable for performance in excess of a minimum hurdle of 12% per annum in three
separate areas:
• Initial Incentive Fees;
• Annual Incentive Fees; and,
• Realised Incentive Fees.
To the extent that there are assets that meet these criterion, independent valuations are performed on the respective International Investments to
determine whether any Incentive Fees are payable.
International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee
The Company's investment in Mint Renewables is eligible for the International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee assessment as at 31 March 2025 (31 March
2024: Kao Data and Gurīn Energy). A negative $0.4 million International Portfolio Initial Incentive Fee has been accrued as at 30 September 2024. Kao
Data and Gurīn Energy generated a total initial incentive fee of $38.8 million at 31 March 2024 (Kao Data: $15.6 million, Gurīn Energy: $22.8 million).
International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee
The Company’s investments in CDC Data Centres, Galileo, Gurīn Energy, Kao Data, Longroad Energy, Qscan Group and RetireAustralia are eligible
for the International Portfolio Annual Incentive fee assessment as at 31 March 2025 (31 March 2024: CDC Data Centres, Galileo, Longroad Energy,
Qscan Group and RetireAustralia).
As at 30 September 2024, it is probable that Infratil will have an International Portfolio Annual Incentive Fee (for the year to 31 March 2025)
due to Morrison based on the performance of the above portfolio of assets, and as a result an amount of $89.7 million has been provided for as
at 30 September 2024 (30 September 2023: $37.3 million, 31 March 2024: $127.8 million).

Payment of Annual Incentive Fees
Any Annual Incentive Fee calculated in respect of a Financial Year is earned and paid in three annual instalments, with the second and third instalments
being scaled down if the fair value of the relevant asset (including distributions, if any) is less than fair value or cost as at the 31 March for which the
Incentive Fee was first calculated.
International Portfolio Realised Incentive Fee
There were no divestments of the Company's investment during the period to 30 September 2024 that resulted in an accrual of a realised incentive
fee (30 September 2023: nil, 31 March 2024: nil).
More detail on how Management fees are calculated is included in Infratil's Annual Report.


(17) Contingent liabilities and legal matters
The Company and certain wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors of the bank debt facilities of Infratil Finance Limited under a Deed of Negative
Pledge, Guarantee and Subordination and the Company is a guarantor to certain obligations of subsidiary companies.


(18) Events after balance date
Dividend
On 13 November 2024, the Directors approved an unimputed interim dividend of 7.25 cents per share to holders of fully paid ordinary shares to

Responsibilities of Directors for the interim consolidated financial
statements
The Directors on behalf of the Group are responsible for:

    ‒    the preparation and fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with
         NZ IAS 34; and

    ‒    implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of interim consolidated financial
         statements that is fairly presented and free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Auditor's responsibilities for the review of the interim consolidated
financial statements
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements based on our
review.

NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the interim consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with NZ IAS 34.

A review of the interim consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is
a limited assurance engagement. The auditor performs procedures, consisting of making enquiries, primarily of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we might identify in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the
financial statements.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Ed Louden.
