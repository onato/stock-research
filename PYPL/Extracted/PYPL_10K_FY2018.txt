   Presentation of Information

   On July 17, 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal Holdings") became an
   independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution
   by eBay (defined below) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of
   PayPal Holdings to eBay's stockholders (which we refer to as the
   "separation" or the "distribution"). For additional information, see
   "Business--Separation from eBay Inc." To accomplish this separation, in
   January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc., which ultimately
   became the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all
   of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. Unless
   otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires,
   references to "we," "our," "us," "the Company," or "PayPal" refer to
   PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case
   of information as of dates or for periods prior to our separation from
   eBay, the consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay,
   including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that
   were historically held at the eBay corporate level, but were
   specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business,
   and references to our "Payments Platform" mean our combined payment
   solution capabilities, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree,
   Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products.

   References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "eBay" refer to eBay
   Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, which
   prior to the separation and distribution, but not after such date,
   included the business and operations of PayPal.

   Trademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks

   PayPal owns or has rights to use the trademarks, service marks, and
   trade names that it uses in conjunction with the operation of its
   business. Some of the more important trademarks that PayPal owns or has
   rights to use that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include:
   PayPal®, PayPal Credit®, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom and iZettle, which may
   be registered or trademarked in the United States and other
   jurisdictions. PayPal's rights to some of these trademarks may be
   limited to select markets. Each trademark, trade name, or service mark
   of any other company appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is,
   to PayPal's knowledge, owned by such other company.

   ITEM 1. BUSINESS

   Overview

   PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and
   is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that
   enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and
   merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial
   services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the
   global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to
   manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any
   platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions,
   including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom and iZettle
   products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.

   PayPal's service enables our customers to send and receive payments. We
   operate a two-sided network where both merchants and consumers have
   PayPal accounts with stored balance functionality. Since PayPal serves
   as a proprietary payment method that is accepted by merchants, we are
   more than a connection to third-party payment networks. Our service
   enables the completion of payments on our Payments Platform on behalf
   of our customers. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their
   accounts to purchase and receive payment for goods and services, as
   well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange
   funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources,
   which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal
   Credit account, a credit or debit card, or other stored value products
   such as coupons and gift cards. Our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products
   also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds
   to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that
   provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant
   access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and
   manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and
   merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity
   and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade.

   We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment
   transactions for our customers and other payment-related services that
   are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our Payments
   Platform. Generally, we do not charge consumers to fund or draw from
   their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees
   charged for foreign currency exchange. We also earn revenue by
   providing other value added services which comprise revenue earned
   through partnerships, our PayPal Credit products, subscription fees,
   gateway services, and other services that we provide to our merchants
   and consumers. Our gateway services, which include our Payflow Gateway
   services and Braintree Gateway services, provide the technology that
   links a merchant's website to its processing network and merchant
   account and enables merchants to accept payments online with credit or
   debit cards.

   Strategy

   Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things,
   consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital
   payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the
   growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on
   those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and
   mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital
   forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our
   ability to innovate and bring new products and services that merchants
   and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business
   includes the following:

   o Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities,
   customer base and scale, increasing our customers' use of our products
   and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to
   accessing, managing and moving money, and expanding the adoption of our
   solutions by new merchants and consumers;

   o Expanding our value proposition for customers: by focusing on trust
   and simplicity, providing risk management and insights from our
   two-sided Payments Platform, and being technology and platform
   agnostic;

   o Extending through strategic partnerships: by building new strategic
   partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offering
   greater choice and flexibility, acquiring new customers, and
   reinforcing our role in the ecosystem; and

   o Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions in
   our existing and new international markets around the world and
   focusing on innovation both in the digital and physical world.

   Key Performance Metrics

   keymetrics2018a05.jpg

   We measure the relevance of our products and services to our customers,
   and therefore the success of our business, through active accounts,
   payment transactions, and payment volume:

   Active Accounts: An active account is an account registered directly
   with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a
   transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive
   transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a
   third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's Payments
   Platform through such third party's login credentials. As of
   December 31, 2018, we had approximately 267 million active accounts
   across more than 200 markets. A market is a geographic area or
   political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate,
   in which we offer some or all of our services. A country, territory, or
   protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations.

   Table of Contents

   Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is the
   total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully
   completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner
   payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.

   Total Payment Volume ("TPV"): TPV is the value of payments, net of
   reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled
   by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including
   gateway-exclusive transactions.

   Our Strengths

   Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth
   and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our
   competitive strengths include the following:

   o Two-sided Platform--our platform connecting merchants and consumers
   enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while
   gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our
   platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions while
   being both technology and platform agnostic.

   o Scale--our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of
   December 31, 2018, we had 267 million active accounts, which included
   21 million active merchant accounts. In 2018, we processed $578 billion
   of TPV in more than 200 markets around the world.

   o Brands--we have built well-recognized and trusted brands. Our
   marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility,
   usage, and overall preference among customers.

   o Risk Management--our risk management system and tokenization usage
   are designed to help keep our customers safe and to help ensure we
   process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and
   reducing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.

   o Regulatory--we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us
   to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and
   support business growth.

   Technology

   Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and
   third-party technologies and services to efficiently and securely
   facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers
   worldwide across different channels, markets and networks. Our Payments
   Platform connects with financial service providers around the world and
   allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment
   methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use
   our Payments Platform can send payments in more than 200 markets across
   the globe and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank
   accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in
   25 currencies.

   A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple
   participants in addition to us, including a merchant, a consumer, and
   the consumer's funding source provider. We have developed intuitive
   user interfaces, customer tools, and transaction completion database
   and network applications on our Payments Platform that help our
   customers utilize our suite of products and services. Our Payments
   Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools
   are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer
   robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers,
   while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers'
   financial information.

   The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform
   simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and
   facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products
   and services. Our technology infrastructure is designed around
   industry-standard architectures intended to reduce downtime in the
   event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform
   incorporates multiple layers of protection for continuity and system
   redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges. We
   have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our
   technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against these
   challenges, including regularly testing our systems to address
   potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our
   technology infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer
   experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security.

   Merchant and Consumer Payment Solutions

   Our combined payment solution capabilities offer our merchants and
   consumers a broad range of products and services, enabling our
   merchants to securely and simply receive payments from their customers
   while allowing our consumers to make seamless transactions across
   different markets and networks.

   We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses
   by improving sales conversion; providing global reach, offering
   alternative payment methods; reducing losses through proprietary
   protection programs, providing fraud prevention and risk management
   solutions; and leveraging data analytics. We generate revenues from
   merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment
   transactions and other payment-related services. Merchants can onboard
   quickly with PayPal and are generally not required to invest in new or
   specialized hardware. We do not charge merchants setup or recurring
   fees for our standard service. We offer access to credit products for
   certain small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working
   Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer
   to as our business financing offerings. Our PayPal Working Capital
   product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their
   annual payment volume processed by PayPal for a fixed fee. Our PayPal
   Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for
   a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as
   well as the business owner. We believe that our business financing
   offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and
   medium-sized business merchants and expand services to new merchants by
   providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or
   efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers.

   PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our
   business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. We
   believe our Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile
   payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers and
   service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile
   applications. Through a single Braintree integration, a merchant can
   begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, PayPal
   Credit, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other payment
   solutions. We also offer gateway services, including our Payflow
   Gateway services and Braintree Gateway services, which enable merchants
   to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway
   services provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant's
   website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept
   payments online with credit and debit cards.

   We believe that our recent acquisition of iZettle in September 2018
   will enable us to further expand our in-store presence and strengthen
   our Payments Platform to help small businesses around the world grow
   and thrive in an omnichannel retail environment. iZettle offers a card
   acceptance service that enables small businesses to take credit and
   debit card payments, as well as a software solution to record, manage
   and analyze sales. iZettle provides in-store capabilities in eleven
   countries, as well as near-term, in-store expansion opportunities into
   other existing PayPal markets.

   We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to
   democratize the management and movement of money. We generate revenue
   from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange and on
   interest and fees from our PayPal Credit product. We offer our PayPal
   Credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout.
   Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made available
   as a funding source in his or her account. We believe that our consumer
   credit products allow us to increase engagement with consumers and
   merchants on our two-sided network and differentiate ourselves from
   other payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales
   through products like PayPal Credit. We are responsible for servicing
   functions related to all of our credit products. In the U.S., credit
   originating from our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan
   products is currently extended through third-party financial
   institutions from whom we purchase the related receivables. For our
   consumer and merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend
   credit through certain international PayPal subsidiaries.

   During the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded our strategic consumer
   credit relationship with Synchrony Financial and agreed to sell our
   U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Following
   the closing of this transaction in July 2018, Synchrony Bank became the
   exclusive issuer of the U.S. PayPal branded consumer credit program and
   we no longer hold an ownership interest in receivables generated
   through the program.

   We offer consumers person-to-person ("P2P") payment solutions through
   our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. PayPal continues to be a key
   driver of our total P2P volumes, enabling both domestic and
   international P2P transfers across our Payments Platform. Our Venmo app
   in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between
   our customers and to make purchases at approved merchants. Xoom is an
   international money transfer service that enables our customers to send
   money to, pay bills for, and send prepaid mobile phone reloads
   to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way,
   using a mobile device or personal computer. P2P is a significant
   customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by
   enabling potential PayPal users to establish active accounts with us at
   the time they make or receive a P2P payment.

   Protecting Merchants and Consumers

   Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from
   financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing in the
   payments industry and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent
   activities, such as account takeover, identity theft, and counterparty
   malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and
   consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and
   consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions
   completed on our Payments Platform, excluding gateway-exclusive
   transactions or situations where our customer agreements specifically
   do not provide for protections. We believe that these programs, which
   protect both merchants and consumers from financial and fraud loss due
   primarily to fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally much
   broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the
   payments industry. As a result, merchants may incur losses for
   chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other
   payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our
   payments services. We also provide consumer protection against losses
   on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days
   post-transaction. We believe that this protection is generally
   consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments
   providers. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both
   the part of consumers (i.e., when using our Payment Platform, they will
   only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item or service
   in the condition significantly as described) and merchants (i.e., they
   will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer).

   Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on
   our proprietary, end-to-end Payments Platform and our ability to
   leverage the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided
   network (i.e., from buyers and sellers, and from senders and receivers
   of payments). We believe mobile devices will continue to play a
   significant and increasing role in commerce, including by creating the
   opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able
   to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the
   mobile operating environment to reduce financial and fraud risk to
   merchants and consumers. Our ongoing investment in systems and
   processes, designed to enhance the safety and security of our products,
   reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world's
   most trusted payments brands.



   Competition

   The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing,
   highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and
   oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including
   those that are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position,
   or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we
   do not offer, as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond
   more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes. We
   compete against all forms of payments, including credit and debit
   cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online
   payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods,
   including cash and check.

   We compete primarily on the basis of the following:

   o ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers
   with our two-sided platform;

   o ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental
   sales by using and offering our services to consumers;

   o consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our
   Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our
   products and services without sharing their financial information with
   the merchant or any other party they are paying;

   o simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;

   o ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce
   channels, including mobile payments, credit products, and payments at
   the retail point of sale;

   o trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection
   programs;

   o customer service experience;

   o brand recognition and preference;

   o website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use,
   speed, availability, and dependability;

   o the technology and payment agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;

   o system reliability and data security;

   o ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws
   and regulations ;

   o ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications
   and operating systems; and

   o quality of developer tools, such as our application programming
   interfaces and software development kits.

   Research and Development

   Total research and development expense was $1.1 billion, $953 million
   and $834 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

   Intellectual Property

   The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks
   (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents, copyrights,
   domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to the
   success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property
   rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and
   internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We
   also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights
   when offering or procuring products and services. We have routinely
   entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with
   our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with
   parties with whom we conduct business, to control use, access to, and
   limit disclosure of our proprietary information.

   We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service
   marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed
   patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions
   covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new
   innovations. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as
   trademarks in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions. We
   also have in place an active program to continue to secure and enforce
   trademarks and domain names that corresponds to our brands in markets
   of interest.

   For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our
   intellectual property, including costs of protecting our intellectual
   property, see the information in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the
   captions "We are subject to patent litigation" and "We may be unable to
   adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or
   third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual
   property rights."

   Government Regulation

   We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment
   characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the
   payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened
   as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as
   countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy,
   cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and
   regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws
   and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the
   advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through
   legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or
   changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations
   are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and
   enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material
   adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial
   condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design
   compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

   Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are
   subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets
   we operate.

   Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments
   industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc.
   holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent),
   which, among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to reporting
   requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of
   customer funds, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside
   the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries
   and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The
   activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a
   financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they
   operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission
   de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the "CSSF"), the Australian
   Securities and Investment Commission, the Monetary Authority of
   Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Russia
   have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their
   respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are
   numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction
   over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the
   payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to
   interpretation and change.

   Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European
   Union ("EU") through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a
   wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a
   bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules
   and regulations of the European banking industry, including those
   related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance,
   anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We also
   are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other
   countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial
   industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner
   financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect
   regulation and examination by these financial institutions' regulators.

   9
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection
   Bureau (the "CFPB") has significant authority to regulate consumer
   financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposit,
   payment, and similar products. As a large market participant of
   remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over
   our business. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other
   jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could
   result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations
   that may affect our business.

   Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is
   subject to anti-money laundering ("AML") laws and regulations in the
   U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the
   use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our
   AML program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used
   to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit
   activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities
   included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S.
   Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Controls ("OFAC")
   and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions
   compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, is
   composed of policies, procedures and internal controls, and is designed
   to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in
   managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

   Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments
   systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For
   example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee ("MIF") Regulation
   caps credit and debit interchange fees for card payments and provides
   for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card
   transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect
   in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory
   challenge.

   Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or
   business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the
   U.S., the EU, Asia Pacific, and elsewhere. For example, the EU adopted
   a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), which
   came into effect in May 2018, as supplemented by any national laws
   (such as in the U.K., the Data Protection Act 2018) and further
   implemented through binding guidance from the European Data Protection
   Board,and expanded the scope of the EU data protection law to foreign
   companies processing personal data of European Economic Area ("EEA")
   individuals, imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime, and
   included new data subject rights (e.g., the right to erasure, commonly
   known as the "right to be forgotten"). In the U.S., we are subject to
   privacy information safeguarding requirements under the
   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written,
   comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the
   operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and
   information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act,
   among other laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are
   considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning
   privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and
   data protection obligations than exist today. In addition, the
   interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection
   laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a
   state of flux.

   Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws,
   such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery
   Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we
   operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising,
   giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value,
   either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or
   private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain
   an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We
   have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are
   designed to comply with these laws and regulations.

   Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies
   continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual
   currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy,
   disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing that may impact PayPal's
   business.

   For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our
   business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our
   payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data
   use, and/or security in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the caption "Risk
   Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and
   Financial Condition" and "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" included elsewhere
   in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Seasonality

   The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to
   net revenues. No individual quarter in 2018, 2017 or 2016 accounted for
   more than 30% of annual net revenue.

   Employees

   As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 21,800 people
   globally, of whom approximately 11,500 were located in the U.S. We
   consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

   Separation from eBay Inc.

   PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for
   the purpose of owning and operating eBay's Payments business in
   connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior
   to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which
   occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the "distribution date"), PayPal
   became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata
   distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal
   to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the "separation" or the
   "distribution"). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of
   business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for
   every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately
   1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17,
   2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal's common stock began "regular way"
   trading under the ticker symbol "PYPL" on the NASDAQ Stock Market on
   July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially
   all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments
   business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015.

   statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks
   and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described
   below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties
   that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material,
   may also become important factors that adversely affect our
   business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
   financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could
   be materially and adversely affected.

   Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and
   Financial Condition

   We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in
   the global payments industry.

   The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing,
   highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. We
   compete against a wide range of businesses, including businesses that
   are larger than we are, have a more dominant and secure position, or
   offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do
   not offer, as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond
   more quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas
   in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive
   technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new
   products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses
   enter into business combinations and alliances, and established
   companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different
   aspects of our business.

   We compete primarily on the basis of the following:

   o ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers
   with our two-sided platform;

   o ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental
   sales by using and offering our services to consumers;

   o consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our
   Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our
   products and services without sharing their financial information with
   the merchant or any other party they are paying;

   o simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;

   o ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce
   channels, including mobile payments, credit products, and payments at
   the retail point of sale;

   o trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection
   programs;

   o customer service experience;

   o brand recognition and preference;

   o website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use,
   speed, availability, and dependability;

   o the technology and payment agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;

   o system reliability and data security;

   o ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws
   and regulations ;

   o ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications
   and operating systems; and

   o quality of developer tools, such as our application programming
   interfaces and software development kits.



   We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all
   forms of payments, including:

   o paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);

   o providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and
   debit cards and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular,
   well-established banks);

   o payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;

   o providers of "digital wallets" which offer customers the ability to
   pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods,
   including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and
   with a variety of payment cards;

   o providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data
   approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication
   ("NFC") or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to
   swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or
   password;

   o payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants,
   including for "card on file" payments where the merchant invites the
   consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to
   use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;

   o providers of "person-to-person" payments that facilitate individuals
   sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;

   o merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment
   networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;

   o money remitters;

   o providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other
   point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and

   o providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.

   We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the
   ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our
   business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense
   and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to
   establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships.

   12
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We also face competition and potential competition from:

   o service providers that provide online merchants the ability to offer
   their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank
   account or paying on credit;

   o issuers of stored value products targeted at online payments;

   o other global online and mobile payment-services providers;

   o services targeting users of social networks and online gaming,
   including those offering social commerce and peer-to-peer payments;

   o payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive
   payments through their bank account, including through immediate or
   real-time payments systems;

   o ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific
   payment provider;

   o services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies;
   and

   o electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both
   online and offline transactions.

   Some of these competitors have larger customer bases, volume, scale,
   resources, and market share than we do, which may provide them
   significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be
   subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering,
   counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They
   may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of
   products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more
   effectively introduce their own innovative programs, products, and
   services that adversely impact our growth.

   If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from
   those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively
   align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able
   to compete effectively in the market.

   Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from
   transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result
   in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could
   adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
   operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common
   stock.

   Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from
   transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our
   operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during
   our operating history, and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a
   result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set
   forth in this "Risk Factors" section. It is difficult for us to
   forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings. In
   view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period
   comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you
   should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due
   to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also
   difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
   Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected
   in our financial statements may be significantly different from
   historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more
   future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts
   and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline
   significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph.

   Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.

   Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and
   regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional
   economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses
   postponing or lowering spending in response to, among other factors:

   o tighter credit,

   o higher unemployment,

   o consumer debt levels or reduced consumer confidence.

   o financial market volatility,

   o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates,

   o changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax
   policies, including increased duties, tariffs, or other restrictions,

   o the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal
   year, another sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the U.S.
   government,

   o government austerity programs, and

   o other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments.

   13
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   These and other global and regional economic events and conditions,
   including Brexit, could have a material adverse impact on the demand
   for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and
   size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any
   financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets
   could cause additional consolidation of the financial services
   industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or
   incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and
   extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency,
   and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our
   business. See also the risk factor captioned, "The United Kingdom's
   departure from the EU could adversely affect us."

   If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide
   new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and
   services and, consequently, our revenues could decline.

   Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the
   industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card
   tokenization, cryptocurrencies, mobile, social commerce (i.e.,
   ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies
   (including distributed ledger and blockchain technologies), and NFC and
   other proximity payment technology, such as contactless payments. As a
   result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge
   and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes
   on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we
   rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for
   the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These
   third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of,
   those technologies, as well as their platforms or products.  In
   addition, we may not be able to accurately predict which technological
   developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those
   technologies may be regulated. We expect that new services and
   technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will
   continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the
   technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing
   and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may
   require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and
   ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new
   products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited
   by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and
   regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants,
   third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success
   will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies
   and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if
   we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our
   business could be harmed.

   Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm
   to our reputation, business, and financial condition.

   Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and
   transmission of customers' personal data, including financial
   information and information about how they interact with our Payments
   Platform. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize
   us to bill their payment cards or bank accounts directly for all
   transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation
   on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more
   secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations,
   including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and
   financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have
   disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which
   have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on
   their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.

   The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access
   to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade
   service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become
   increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect
   quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have
   been launched against a target. We expect that unauthorized parties
   will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities
   through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities
   or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, or attempting to
   fraudulently induce (for example, through spear phishing attacks) our
   employees, customers, partners, vendors, or other users of our systems
   into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or
   other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our
   information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored
   and supported by significant financial and technological resources,
   making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Numerous
   and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting
   cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, could compromise
   the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our
   systems. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for
   such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the
   widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we
   have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and
   customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and
   expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these
   protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures
   provide absolute security.

   Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to
   cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to
   access our customers' personal or proprietary information and payment
   card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. We
   have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future,
   breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance,
   system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or
   perceived breaches of our security could, among other things:

   14
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o interrupt our operations,

   o result in our systems or services being unavailable,

   o result in improper disclosure of data,

   o materially harm our reputation and brands,

   o result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial
   exposure,

   o cause us to incur significant remediation costs,

   o lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our
   products and services,

   o divert the attention of management from the operation of our
   business,

   o result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us
   to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to
   them or claims by them, and

   o adversely affect our business and results of operations.

   In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting
   companies that we acquire or our customers, partners, or vendors
   (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have
   similar negative effects. See Note 4--"Business Combinations," Note
   5--"Goodwill and Intangible Assets" and Note 13--"Commitments and
   Contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure
   relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks ("TIO") (which
   we acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security
   vulnerability of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities
   or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us.

   In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card
   processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we
   store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors,
   we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of
   issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend
   significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy
   breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches.
   Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the
   U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks
   and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could
   impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices,
   make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the
   ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. While we
   maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us
   for losses caused by security breaches.

   Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our
   websites, applications, products, or services could harm our business.

   Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may
   experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and
   software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and
   other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods,
   fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in
   telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,
   terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events.
   We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the
   future, disruptions in our systems due to break-ins, sabotage, and
   intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully
   redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for
   all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we
   are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require
   specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans,
   and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and
   time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business
   priorities.

   We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system
   failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other events or conditions
   from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or
   adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and
   services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of
   revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in
   the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services
   could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent
   interruptions in our services could cause current or potential
   customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to
   switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products
   and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands.
   Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to
   our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners
   could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us
   for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely
   be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other
   consequences described in this "Risk Factors" section under the caption
   "Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm
   to our reputation, business, results of operation, and financial
   condition."

   Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience
   intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious
   delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of
   gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital
   payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming
   efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts
   are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and
   may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can
   be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a
   regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or
   persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny,
   significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to
   our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing
   licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining
   additional licenses that may be required for our business.

   We also rely on facilities, components, and services supplied by third
   parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services.
   If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services,
   experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their
   agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our
   expectations, or experience a cybersecurity incident, our operations
   could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result
   in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands,
   and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry
   business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all
   losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of
   systems failures and similar events.

   In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information
   systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and
   technologies is complex, expensive, and time-consuming. If we fail to
   timely and successfully implement new information systems and
   technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information
   systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not
   operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business,
   internal controls (including internal controls over financial
   reporting), results of operations, and financial condition.

   Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices
   could harm our business.

   We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions
   and pay fees for their services. From time to time, payment card
   networks have increased, and may continue to increase in the future,
   the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each
   transaction that accesses their networks. Payment card networks have
   imposed, and may impose in the future, special fees or assessments for
   transactions that are executed through a "digital wallet" such as
   PayPal's, which could particularly impact us and significantly increase
   our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any
   increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as
   increase their own fees for processing, which could increase our
   operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into
   strategic partnerships with Visa and Mastercard and other credit card
   networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it
   easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with
   their respective credit and debit cards. During the terms of these
   agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose
   any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the
   agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees
   or other special assessments.

   In addition, in some jurisdictions, governmental regulations have
   required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees. Any material
   change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other
   markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee
   limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against
   traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business.

   We are required to comply with payment card network operating rules,
   including special operating rules for payment service providers to
   merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines
   they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule
   violations by us or our merchants. We may also be directly liable to
   the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card
   networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged
   from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate
   these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably,
   they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes
   in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks
   could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing
   rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible
   to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our
   ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund
   their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their
   payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or
   are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely
   affected.

   16
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business
   processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating
   rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with
   these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from
   payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging
   in activities that are illegal or that are considered "high risk,"
   including the sale of certain types of digital content. For "high risk"
   merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal
   services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and
   conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although
   the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional
   fines in the future could become significant and could result in a
   termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes
   in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely
   affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the
   cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the
   development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may
   negatively impact their deployment and adoption.

   Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad
   transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss
   rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and
   consumer confidence in and use of our services.

   Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of
   transactions on a daily basis. In the event that merchants do not
   fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or
   services do not match the merchant's description, we may incur
   substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to
   recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover
   in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in
   the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a
   merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their
   delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made
   goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such
   goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or
   through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their
   payment. While we have established allowances for transaction losses
   based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to
   cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date, these reserves may
   be insufficient.

   We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not
   authorize the purchase, from customer fraud, from erroneous
   transactions, and as a result of customers who have closed bank
   accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy
   payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card
   transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our
   losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm
   our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of
   fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not
   be effective against fraud, particularly new and continually evolving
   forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these
   measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed.

   We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that
   could materially and adversely affect our financial results.

   We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in
   foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, which subject us to foreign currency risk.
   The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British
   Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the
   translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies
   into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in
   multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly
   set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in
   foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that
   we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies,
   our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these
   non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange
   risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
   the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter
   into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our
   foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is
   impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure.

   Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more
   difficult could harm our business.

   Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer
   are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and
   profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues
   and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a
   single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our
   primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important
   markets.

   17
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by,
   foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and
   application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction
   of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in
   the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation
   and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border
   trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions, impose
   conflicting obligations, and increase the costs associated with
   cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border
   trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make
   cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy
   or higher tariffs, could negatively impact our revenues and profits and
   harm our business. See also the risk factor captioned, "Global and
   regional economic conditions could harm our business."

   Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our
   business.

   We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using
   credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards,
   and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic
   transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal
   account balance or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products.
   Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our
   consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively,
   "payment cards"), which can significantly increase our costs. Although
   we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal
   account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may
   prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer
   features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal
   accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using
   payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other
   events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to
   fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and
   adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our
   business.

   We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card
   networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and
   make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these
   partners' credit and/or debt cards and to allow us to gain access to
   these partners' tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal
   transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our
   business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic
   partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase
   in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process,
   we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions
   will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the
   transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could
   adversely affect our business, results of operations, and
   profitability.

   The United Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us.

   The United Kingdom ("U.K.") held a referendum in June 2016 in which a
   majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU")
   (commonly referred to as "Brexit"). In March 2017, the U.K. government
   initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty on European
   Union, which commenced a two-year period expiring on March 29, 2019,
   after which time the U.K. is expected to leave the EU in the absence of
   any effective extension to the Article 50 period. Political
   negotiations are underway; however, there is a significant lack of
   clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the terms of
   the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU. The U.K.'s financial
   service regulators are implementing Temporary Permission Regimes that
   are expected to be put in place by the U.K.'s government to support
   European Economic Area ("EEA") financial services firms in continuing
   to conduct business in the U.K. should the U.K. exit the EU without an
   agreement.

   Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and
   worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to
   instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including
   volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn
   could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we
   do business, particularly in the U.K. Brexit could lead to greater
   restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services
   between the U.K and the EEA region, with the potential inability of
   U.K. companies to fulfill orders leading in turn to a risk of increased
   merchant defaults and buyer protection claims. Brexit could also
   trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in
   consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth. Any of these
   scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our
   customers.

   In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased
   complexity for financial services firms as national laws and
   regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations.
   In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new
   regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:

   o if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulator
   permissions, our EU operations could lose their ability to offer
   services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market and for our U.K.
   based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the EEA
   markets. For example, our ability to work primarily with the Luxembourg
   regulator as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K.
   operations may also be impacted;

   18
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to
   operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to
   our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities,
   the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional
   arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be
   materially affected or disrupted);

   o we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the
   U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory
   requirements of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for
   our EU and UK operations; and

   o our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in
   appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business
   of PayPal could be adversely impacted.

   These and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the
   aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
   condition, and results of operations.

   Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and
   oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping,
   and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations
   could materially harm our business.

   Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and
   legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including,
   but not limited to, those governing:

   o banking,

   o credit,

   o deposit taking,

   o cross-border and domestic money transmission,

   o prepaid access,

   o foreign exchange,

   o privacy,

   o data protection,

   o cybersecurity,

   o banking secrecy,

   o payment services (including payment processing and settlement
   services),

   o consumer protection,

   o economic and trade sanctions,

   o anti-money laundering, and

   o counter-terrorist financing.

   Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory
   oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations
   that apply to our business.

   As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become
   increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or
   markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are
   accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide
   services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim
   that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws
   regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies outside of
   the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting
   obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain
   transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be
   prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of
   Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") or U.S. anti-money laundering or
   counter-terrorist financing regulations.

   Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws,
   regulations, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes
   to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or
   orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us
   to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits,
   forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or
   more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure
   requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict
   our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make
   product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or
   improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the
   aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and
   adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The
   complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement
   regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the
   evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event
   giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal
   and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in
   different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures
   designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and
   regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees,
   contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations.

   Payments Regulation

   In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money
   transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are
   required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin
   Islands, and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal
   branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree,
   Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We may also maintain such
   licenses for certain companies that we have recently acquired, such as
   Hyperwallet. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to
   restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds,
   reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state
   regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or
   regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional
   restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain
   states, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain
   additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose
   substantial costs.

   While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send
   payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only
   approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also
   receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the
   manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may
   adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets.

   We principally provide our services to customers in the EU through
   PayPal (Europe) S.a.r.l. et Cie., SCA ("PayPal (Europe)"), our
   wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a
   credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is
   subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates
   the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, fund
   management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information
   security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements
   imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are
   typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent
   interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can
   make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage.
   Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and
   potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European
   Directives, including the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money
   Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally
   difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive ("PSD2")
   entered into force in January 2016 and is in the process of being
   implemented into national legislation, with certain requirements
   effective January 13, 2018. However, a number of EU member states have
   not yet fully implemented PSD2 into domestic legislation. Luxembourg,
   which is the home member state of PayPal (Europe), implemented PSD2 on
   July 28, 2018. The implementation of PSD2 may negatively affect our
   business. PSD2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly
   formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access
   bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes
   of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a
   customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal
   and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new
   types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 seeks to
   regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers.
   PayPal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed,
   or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant
   marketplaces solution may not be able to offer PayPal products in the
   future. PSD2 also imposes new standards (coming into force on September
   14, 2019) for payment security and strong customer authentication that
   may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal
   transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal's customer value
   proposition and its European business.

   If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain
   thresholds, or if the European Central Bank ("ECB") so determines,
   PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that
   some activity of PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the
   ECB rather than the Luxembourg regulator (the "CSSF"), as its national
   supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would
   likely increase compliance costs.

   In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business,
   we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned
   subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the
   Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored
   value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result,
   PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments
   (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer
   payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many
   of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is
   unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject
   only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local
   laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us
   to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or
   otherwise. Payment services legislation currently pending in Singapore
   may change how PayPal Pte. Ltd is regulated and, if such legislation is
   passed, our compliance and operating costs will likely increase.

   In certain markets outside the U.S. (e.g., Australia), we provide our
   services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local
   regulatory supervision or oversight, which may be the holder of a local
   payment license, certification, or other authorization. In such
   markets, we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement
   action if we violate applicable reporting, anti-money laundering,
   capital requirements, privacy, corporation governance, risk management,
   or any other applicable requirements.

   20
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to apply for
   various licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals in a number
   of the jurisdictions where we provide our services, including due to
   changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of
   such laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be
   able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and
   approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential
   product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses,
   certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or
   other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure,
   reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance,
   or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose
   substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the
   development or provision of our products or services, require
   significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from
   providing our products or services in a given market.

   In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be
   licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution,
   or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process
   payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency.
   Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local
   merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede
   us from doing business in a jurisdiction. Such regulatory actions or
   the need to obtain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory
   approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to
   the provision or development of our services, require significant and
   costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or
   additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing
   any products or services in a given market.

   Consumer Protection

   We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the
   countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal
   and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our
   activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ("EFTA") and
   Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
   ("CFPB"). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of
   changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures,
   and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not
   authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally,
   technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the
   assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to
   $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class
   action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable
   for plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in such cases. We are subject to, and
   have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations
   that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise
   advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g.,
   that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited
   consumer accounts).

   In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts. The
   rule's definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are
   capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to
   conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs
   and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital
   wallets. The rule's requirements include: the disclosure of fees and
   other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid
   account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and
   error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application
   of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with
   overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account
   agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. In
   April 2017, the CFPB delayed the effective date of the final rule on
   prepaid accounts to April 1, 2018, and indicated that it would review,
   among other issues, the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that
   are capable of storing funds. In June 2017, the CFPB released proposed
   changes to its final rule, and in January 2018, the CFPB issued its
   final rule, modifying some aspects of the rule, with an overall
   effective date of April 1, 2019. We are in the process of implementing
   certain changes to comply with the final rule. We expect that such
   implementation will require us to make substantial changes to the
   design of certain U.S. consumer accounts and their operability, which
   could lead to customer dissatisfaction, require us to reallocate
   resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our
   business.

   In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent
   Order ("Consent Order") with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory
   claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The
   Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in
   redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and
   required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures
   and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage
   with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order,
   which may result in us incurring additional costs.

   PayPal (Europe) principally offers its services in EU countries through
   a "passport" notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to
   regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU regulations.
   Regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local
   consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to
   Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the
   Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its or the
   PayPal group's activities in the local country directly or through a
   branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could
   increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU
   countries.

   Economic and Trade Sanctions

   We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions
   administered by OFAC and the Council of the European Union,
   respectively. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that
   were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible
   violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we
   reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising
   from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to
   the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program.
   Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible
   violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking
   additional information about certain of these transactions. Such
   self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against
   us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or
   penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner
   that could result in a material loss, require significant management
   time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or
   otherwise harm our business.

   Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing

   We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
   financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among
   other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal
   activities. Regulators in the U.S. and other regulators globally
   continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these
   obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our
   compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the
   identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic
   transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money
   laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we
   have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our
   compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators
   regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must
   obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers
   and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for
   compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money
   Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying
   transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer
   Regulation) may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult
   to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a
   decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth
   Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of
   PayPal (Europe)'s total annual turnover. On April 19, 2018, the
   European Parliament adopted the European Commission's proposal for a
   Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, containing more stringent
   provisions in certain areas, which may also increase compliance costs.

   Privacy and Protection of User Data

   We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations
   (which we refer to as "privacy laws") relating to the collection, use,
   retention, security, processing, and transfer (which we refer to as
   "process") of personally identifiable information about our customers
   and employees (which we refer to as "personal data") in the countries
   where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of data in many
   jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a
   result, much of the personal data that we process, especially financial
   information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases,
   the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws
   apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of
   information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties
   with which we have commercial relationships.

   Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, and the collection,
   storage, use, and sharing of personal data is increasing around the
   world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory
   environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which
   continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect
   to evolving technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain
   technology.

   Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy
   policies and communicated to users prior to our collection, use,
   storage and transfer, and disclosure of their personal data, with
   applicable industry data protection or security standards, with any
   applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or with privacy, data
   protection, information security, or consumer protection-related laws
   and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in
   proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities (which
   we refer to as "supervisory authorities"), governmental entities or
   others, including class action privacy litigation in certain
   jurisdictions, would subject us to significant awards, fines,
   penalties, judgments, and negative publicity arising from any financial
   or non-financial damages suffered by any individuals. This could,
   individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.
   Specifically, this would likely require us to change our business
   practices, and would increase the costs and complexity of compliance.
   In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our
   ability to provide products and services to our customers.

   22
     __________________________________________________________________

   PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal
   data of EU citizens to the U.S., including reliance on Binding
   Corporate Rules ("BCRs") for internal transfers of certain types of
   personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") as approved by
   the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal
   must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of
   PayPal's EU customers and/or employees outside of the EU have compliant
   transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice
   invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously
   relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data
   of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with
   those third parties who had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe
   Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a
   replacement for Safe Harbor known as "Privacy Shield." Both the Privacy
   Shield framework and SCCs are facing legal challenges in the European
   justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are
   invalidated, PayPal's ability to process EU personal data with third
   parties outside of the EU could be jeopardized.

   In 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation
   ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018. The EU data protection
   regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign
   companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict
   data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the
   greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or EUR20 million, and includes new
   rights such as the "portability" of personal data. Although the GDPR
   applies across the EU without a need for local implementing
   legislation, each EU member state has the ability to interpret the GDPR
   opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection
   legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a
   country-by-country basis. Implementation of the GDPR has required us to
   change our business practices and increased the costs and complexity of
   compliance.

   PayPal also faces additional potential challenges from local data
   protection agencies ("DPAs"). Because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered
   in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction,
   we have relied on the "one-stop-shop" concept under which Luxembourg
   has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a 2015
   European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do
   business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data
   protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU
   member states in which we have established legal entities and which
   apply privacy laws that are different than, and may conflict with,
   Luxembourg privacy laws.

   In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails,
   phone calls, and other communications we send or make to our customers
   for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that
   provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation
   could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For
   example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), in the
   U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of
   $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may triple the
   damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, and may
   continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits)
   containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These
   lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive
   relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications
   we send to our customers, a determination that there have been
   violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could
   expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in
   the aggregate, materially harm our business.

   If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on
   their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur
   significant losses.

   We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other
   investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial
   institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging
   activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial
   instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and
   financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We
   regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and
   actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite
   these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or
   deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of,
   these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty
   default, deterioration, or failure may be heightened during economic
   downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one
   of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy,
   our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to
   access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts
   with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity
   or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy
   proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our
   counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could
   negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

   PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon
   third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our
   business, which raises additional risks.

   As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution, nor licensed to
   make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on third-party chartered
   financial institutions to provide PayPal branded credit products to our
   customers in the U.S., including consumer credits products such as
   PayPal Credit and PayPal branded Mastercard credit cards, and business
   credit products such as PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan
   products. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank's ability
   or willingness to lend could interrupt, potentially materially, our
   ability to offer consumer and business loan products, which could
   materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a partner
   bank's inability or unwillingness to lend, we may need to reach a
   similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or
   obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses. We may be unable to
   reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at
   all. Obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly,
   time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to
   additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome,
   increase our costs, and require us to change our business practices. In
   addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are
   federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from
   time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.

   In July 2018, we completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, for total consideration of
   $6.9 billion. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing true-up
   and certain other adjustments under the terms of the purchase
   agreement. As a part of a separate agreement, PayPal earns a revenue
   share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank,
   which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables and we
   will not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit
   receivables. It may take us longer than expected to realize the
   anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may
   ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all,
   which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In
   addition, our increased reliance on Synchrony Bank subjects us to risks
   in the nature of those discussed in this "Risk Factors" section under
   the caption "We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business,
   which creates additional risk."

   Our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings
   may be subject to challenge.

   Business loans under our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business
   Loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a
   program agreement with us. We acquire the receivables generated by
   those loans after they are originated.

   A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
   Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted
   in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans
   originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury
   laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs
   challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with
   the terms of certain loans. Although the decision specifically
   addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could
   support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions,
   including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like the
   issuing bank of loans under PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business
   Loan products. After the Madden decision, there continue to be a number
   of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability
   of business models where a non-bank entity enters into a relationship
   with a third-party chartered financial institution for the issuance of
   credit products. While we believe the manner in which PayPal branded
   credit products are offered can be distinguished from Madden, there can
   be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, and an
   adverse determination could materially and adversely impact our PayPal
   Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products and our business.

   Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks.

   We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and our PayPal Working
   Capital and PayPal Business Loan products to a wide range of consumers
   and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these
   products depends on the effective management of related risk. The
   credit decisioning process for the PayPal Credit consumer product in
   markets outside the U.S. uses proprietary segmentation and credit
   algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the
   credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their
   past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit
   scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are
   applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business finance
   offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may
   not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant
   due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions
   related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions,
   economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data,
   among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability
   to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be
   affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors' actions,
   changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, and
   other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product
   offerings also exposes us to additional risks, including those
   discussed in the risk factor captioned "Our international operations
   subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business."

   24

   Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant
   credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their
   payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. We
   face similar risks with respect to U.S. consumer credit losses through
   the profit sharing relationship with Synchrony Bank. The non-payment
   rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things,
   changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such
   as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in
   prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders
   who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders
   who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not
   repay their loans.

   We currently purchase receivables related to the PayPal branded
   merchant credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our
   purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner,
   or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized
   for these purposes, our business could be harmed.

   Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business

   War, terrorism, political events, geopolitical instability, trade
   barriers and restrictions, public health issues, natural disasters, or
   other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or
   disruption to the economy and commerce on a global, regional or
   country-specific basis, which could have a material adverse effect on
   our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business.
   Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make
   it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to
   our customers. Our corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon
   Valley, which is a seismically active region in California. Our
   business operations are subject to interruption by, among others,
   natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear
   power plant accidents, and events beyond our control such as other
   industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor
   disputes and public health issues. A catastrophic event that results in
   a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in
   significant losses and require substantial recovery time and
   significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations,
   which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
   condition, and results of operations.

   Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our
   loss rate.

   Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and
   consumers from fraudulent transactions, and consumers if they do not
   receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly
   different from its description. In addition, consumers who pay through
   PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer
   (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of
   losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to
   individual buyers, sellers, and transactions, and may also be impacted
   by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these
   programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes
   that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of
   transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Increases in our
   loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller
   protection programs, could harm our business.

   Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could
   harm our business.

   Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of
   our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing
   business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and
   cross-border basis, including, but not limited to:

   o foreign currency and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in
   this "Risk Factors" section under the captions "We are exposed to
   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates" and "Any factors that
   reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm
   our business";

   o risks related to other government regulation or required compliance
   with local laws;

   o local licensing and reporting obligations;

   o obligations to comply with local regulatory and legal obligations
   related to privacy, data security, and data localization;

   o expenses associated with localizing our products and services,
   including offering customers the ability to transact business in the
   local currency, and adapting our products and services to local
   preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or
   no experience;

   o trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;

   o difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a
   large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance,
   language, and cultural differences;

   o stringent local labor laws and regulations;

   o credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;

   o profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange
   restrictions, or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
   rates for a particular currency;

   o political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or
   human rights issues;

   o geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health
   issues, acts of war, and terrorism;

   25
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o import or export regulations;

   o compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt
   payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices
   Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;

   o compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money
   laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;

   o antitrust and competition regulations;

   o potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;

   o economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;

   o national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;

   o different, uncertain, overlapping, or more stringent user protection,
   data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations; and

   o increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.

   Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations
   that apply to our international operations may result in fines,
   criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our
   employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to
   our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures
   designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no
   assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate
   our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations
   and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business
   internationally, and could harm our business.

   We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.

   We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and
   from interest-rate sensitive assets, including assets underlying the
   customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A
   low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may
   negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In
   addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our
   customers' spending levels and ability and willingness to pay
   outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to
   higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under
   mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may
   reduce our customers' ability to remain current on their obligations to
   us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and
   allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse
   effect on our net income.

   We have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364-day
   delayed-draw term loan credit facility. We have borrowed under these
   credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these
   credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate, exposing us to
   interest rate fluctuations.

   Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our
   business.

   Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper
   uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online
   gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of
   prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software,
   movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in
   particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography human
   trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco
   products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or to facilitate
   other illegal activity. Use of our payment system for illegal or
   improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to
   claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and
   regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests that could result in
   liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that
   may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another
   jurisdiction, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be
   found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting
   in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for
   intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal
   activities, and government authorities may consider additional
   payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual
   property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal
   action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that
   are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly
   infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in
   reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction
   volume, or increased costs could harm our business.

   Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our
   customer funds properly could harm our business.

   We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers,
   including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to
   sellers of goods and services or recipients of person to person ("P2P")
   transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are
   required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant
   regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the
   aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and
   account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and
   comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level
   of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand
   our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated
   internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF,
   utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg
   banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain
   customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our
   ability to properly manage our customers' balances and handle large and
   growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure
   to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and
   the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance
   with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational
   harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products
   and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially
   harm our business.

   We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under
   competition laws.

   We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S.
   and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition
   laws. An increasing number of governments are actively enforcing
   competition laws and regulations. Some jurisdictions also provide
   private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims
   of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies
   have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate
   the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other
   countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair
   competition. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or
   other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust
   litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S.,
   may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that
   otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed
   anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit,
   may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative
   publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and
   could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines or
   remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business
   practices.

   We are subject to patent litigation.

   We have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties'
   patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of
   patent lawsuits. We expect that we will continue to be subject to
   patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:

   o our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity
   and to converge with technologies not previously associated with the
   payments space;

   o we continue to expand into new business areas, including through
   acquisitions; and

   o the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the
   companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their
   patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent
   owners, continues to increase.

   Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users
   whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so
   or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that many of the
   claims against us and other technology companies have been, and
   continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary
   business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen
   significant patent disputes between operating companies in some
   technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are
   time-consuming and costly to manage, defend, and resolve, and could
   require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business,
   enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial
   payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings,
   or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business.

   We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual
   property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing
   their intellectual property rights.

   The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks,
   patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is
   important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our
   intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and
   regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of
   administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to
   protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and
   services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements
   entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality
   agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.

   27
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in
   every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be
   required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent
   infringement or to enforce our rights.

   Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual
   property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
   in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that
   contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect
   our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or
   misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent
   development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by
   others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,
   registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that
   infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value
   of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely
   affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent
   of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in
   the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our
   proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to
   others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our
   proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately
   protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant
   costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible
   assets and materially harm our business.

   As the number of products in the technology and payments industries
   increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and
   as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may
   become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and
   other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and
   scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
   The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and,
   regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may
   be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management's
   time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other
   things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay
   substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits,
   pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification
   obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have
   commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or
   other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual
   property matters, may harm or restrict our business.

   We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory actions, and
   government inquiries.

   We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action
   lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions
   or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules
   and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual
   property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money
   laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption,
   consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and
   employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising,
   contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property,
   those matters described in Note 13--"Commitments and
   Contingencies--Litigation and Regulatory Matters--General Matters" to
   our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. In
   particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and
   intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and
   significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our
   business expands in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products
   and services increase in scale and complexity. In addition, the laws,
   rules and regulations affecting our business, including those
   pertaining to internet and mobile commerce, data protection, payments
   services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the
   courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in
   the scope and application of these laws, rules, and regulations
   increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and
   governmental actions alleging violations.

   The scope, outcome, and impact of claims, lawsuits, government
   investigations, disputes, and proceedings to which we are subject
   cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such
   matters can have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our
   business, results of operations, or financial condition because of
   legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage,
   and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and
   regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that
   involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more of such legal
   and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require
   us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or
   penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could
   materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or
   financial condition. These proceedings could also result in
   reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that
   prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to
   change our business practices in costly ways, or develop non-infringing
   or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these
   consequences could materially and adversely affect our business,
   results of operations, and financial condition.

   While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions
   with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to
   consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we
   will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including
   the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case.
   Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or
   indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses
   and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or
   limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or
   class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits,
   including additional consumer class action litigation, and
   significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class
   action litigation.

   Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our
   business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial conditions.

   On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal
   tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
   2017 (the "Tax Act"). The Tax Act made changes to the corporate tax
   rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings,
   among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning
   after December 31, 2017. Throughout calendar year 2018, the U.S.
   Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and
   clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax
   Act. Additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in
   2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our
   U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently
   computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and
   increase our future U.S. tax expense. We are continuing to evaluate the
   Tax Act and its requirements, as well as its application to our
   business and its impact on our effective tax rate. At this stage, it is
   unclear how many U.S. states will continue to incorporate these federal
   law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes. The
   implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply
   with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could
   require us to make substantial changes to our business practices,
   allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could
   negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial
   condition.

   We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

   The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other
   tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there
   are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
   determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the Tax Act
   may require the collection of information not regularly produced within
   the Company, the use of estimates in our financial statements, and the
   exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.

   Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in
   multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our
   tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable
   domestic and foreign authorities, and we are currently undergoing a
   number of investigations, audits, and reviews by authorities throughout
   the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a
   negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may
   differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may
   materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such
   determination is made. While we have established reserves based on
   assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such
   eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.

   In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by
   earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses,
   in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than
   anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by
   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as
   a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program; or
   changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as
   certain discrete items.

   Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state
   legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization
   for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") and the EU, are
   increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory
   action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other
   legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax
   rate.

   We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and
   record-keeping obligations.

   A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign
   countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing
   reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or
   facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number
   of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and
   other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants
   for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet known
   requirements and expect further modifications will be required to
   comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our
   customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us
   to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping
   obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other
   sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain
   jurisdictions, and harm our business. In addition, in June 2018, the
   U.S. Supreme Court ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that states
   may collect internet sales tax on online purchases made outside of the
   state, which could adversely affect some of our merchants and
   indirectly harm our customers.

   Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other
   strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could
   harm our business.

   Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other
   strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate
   strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array
   of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business
   strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and
   dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products,
   and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and
   commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve
   significant challenges, uncertainties and risks, including:

   o the potential loss of key customers, vendors, and other key business
   partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and
   continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;

   o difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining
   employee morale, and retention issues affecting employees (particularly
   the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or
   dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management,
   reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the
   acquired or disposed business;

   o diversion of management time and focus;

   o inability to realize synergies expected to result from an
   acquisition;

   o the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems
   (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human
   resource, and other administrative systems), technologies, data assets,
   products, and personnel of each acquired company, which is an
   inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;

   o the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls,
   procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company at
   acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked
   such controls, procedures, and policies or whose controls, procedures,
   and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;

   o the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration
   of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen
   difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;

   o potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and
   regulatory obligations associated with new products and services or
   entry into new markets;

   o risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;

   o unidentified issues discovered in our due diligence process,
   including product or service quality issues, intellectual property
   issues, and legal contingencies;

   o risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively
   managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic
   partnerships;

   o risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at
   companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;

   o lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;

   o liability for activities or conduct of the acquired company before
   the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes,
   violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax
   liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;

   o the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information,
   which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and/or
   additional controls, policies, and procedures, and subject us to
   additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance;
   and

   o our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating
   metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired
   businesses, and the risk that errors or irregularities in those
   systems, controls, and processes will lead to errors in our financial
   statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.

   Table of Contents

   At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations
   with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions,
   any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
   our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no
   assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and
   consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer
   than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these
   transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than
   anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect
   our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions
   may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our
   cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize
   liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible
   assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the
   economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our
   results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness,
   as applicable.

   We completed our acquisition of iZettle AB (publ) ("iZettle") on
   September 20, 2018. Prior to the closing of the acquisition, the UK
   Competition and Markets Authority ("CMA") initiated a review of the
   transaction. On December 5, 2018, the CMA referred the acquisition for
   a Phase 2 investigation and on December 24, 2018, directed PayPal to
   appoint a monitoring trustee. The deadline for the final decision is
   May 21, 2019. PayPal is working cooperatively with the CMA and has
   agreed to hold parts of the PayPal and iZettle businesses separate as
   agreed with the CMA, pending completion of the CMA's investigation. Our
   ability to successfully and timely integrate iZettle's business and
   operations with ours and realize the potential synergies and
   anticipated benefits from the acquisition is subject to the timing and
   possible outcome of the CMA's review. The CMA has broad discretion and
   may impose requirements, limitations or costs, mandate remedies, such
   as divestitures of certain business assets, or place additional
   restrictions on the conduct of our businesses, to ensure sufficient
   competition in the U.K. market. No assurance can be given as to the
   ultimate impact and outcome of the CMA review, that approval from the
   CMA will be obtained, or the terms and conditions of such approval.

   Because acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be
   successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or
   financial condition. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require
   us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt
   (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record
   amortization expenses related to intangible assets or impairment of
   goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting
   rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of
   operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as
   applicable.

   Joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser
   degree of influence over business operations, thereby potentially
   increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks
   associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition,
   we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling
   shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them
   and who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are
   inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or
   omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders,
   management or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or
   companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our
   investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and
   otherwise damage our reputation and brand.

   There are risks associated with our indebtedness.

   We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness
   in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for
   our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business
   operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. In
   addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating
   could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity
   securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are
   downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable
   by us under out indebtedness may increase. In addition, any downgrades
   to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional
   financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.
   Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and
   results of operations.

   We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates
   additional risk.

   We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the
   following:

   o networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link
   us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process
   transactions;

   o unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate the U.S. PayPal Credit
   and PayPal Mastercard consumer credit products, PayPal Working Capital,
   and PayPal Business Loan products;

   o third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements
   processing;

   o third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and
   product development functions, which are critical to our operations;
   and

   o third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components,
   and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.

   31
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and
   to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased
   operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial,
   legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, privacy
   breaches, service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, or other
   problems, which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or
   prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our
   customers on our behalf, which could harm our business. In addition,
   these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with
   our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and
   regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on
   commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process
   transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that
   degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or
   requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to
   competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who
   provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will
   continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties
   do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform
   their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf, we may be
   unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and
   efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be
   subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of
   the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal
   or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could
   harm our business.

   Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks.

   We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable
   merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to,
   or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment
   cards and codes using the mobile device's embedded camera, and which
   enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of
   sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment
   card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will
   make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay
   for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via PayPal at the
   point of sale. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these
   partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale
   PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point
   of sale transactions that we process. We believe that our recent
   acquisition of iZettle will enable us to further expand our in-store
   presence. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at
   the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:

   o increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the
   reliability and availability of our systems and services and
   correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to
   meet;

   o significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly
   from established payment card providers, many of which have
   substantially greater resources than we do;

   o increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are
   less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and
   associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at
   the point of sale;

   o exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware
   devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction
   or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial
   liability and require product recalls or other actions;

   o exposure to additional laws, rules, and regulations;

   o increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store
   payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of
   sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad
   providers), payment processors, and banks that enable in-store
   transactions; and

   o lower operating income than our other payment solutions.

   Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including
   driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point
   of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed.

   Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for
   our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,
   and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our
   business. The loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain
   and grow our business.

   Our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the
   continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and
   other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and
   motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense,
   especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate
   headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we
   may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain
   sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions,
   particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates
   often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in
   connection with their employment, and our stock price volatility, or a
   perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may
   increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments
   companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate
   employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally
   by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. Potential changes
   in U.S. immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain
   visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are
   actively recruiting. Negative sentiments towards the U.S. as a result
   of these potential changes may also adversely affect our international
   recruiting efforts. Furthermore, legislative or administrative changes
   to immigration or visa laws and regulations may impair our hiring
   processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the
   country where the work is to be performed. In addition, we do not have
   long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do
   not maintain any "key person" life insurance policies. The loss of the
   services of any of our key personnel, or if we are not able to attract
   or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively, could harm our
   business and growth prospects.

   We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated
   through our products and services.

   Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating
   to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging
   defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract,
   invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement,
   or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials
   disseminated through the services, among other things. The laws
   relating to the liability of companies providing online services for
   information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent
   challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties
   for the customer-provided content on our products and services,
   particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable
   laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our
   customers and carried on our products and services, we could be
   directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to
   reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial
   resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which
   could harm our business.

   Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay

   If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does
   not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S.
   federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the
   Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders
   could be subject to significant tax liabilities.

   On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company
   through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our
   outstanding common stock to eBay's stockholders (which we sometimes
   refer to as the "separation" or the "distribution"). eBay received an
   opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of
   the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a
   transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax
   purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion
   was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and
   assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements, and
   undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past
   and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations,
   statements, or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete,
   or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the
   separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the
   conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.

   Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that
   the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be
   treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of
   these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such
   opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS
   disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of
   counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no
   assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in
   the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the
   separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed
   to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections
   368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize
   taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable
   sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal
   common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had
   received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such
   shares, and we could incur significant liabilities.

   There are risks associated with our relationship with eBay.

   In connection with our separation from eBay, we entered into a
   separation and distribution agreement with eBay, as well as various
   other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters
   agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property
   matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development
   agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the
   employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters
   agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities
   (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the
   separation for those respective areas and include associated
   indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing
   addendum, and the product development agreement establish certain
   commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment
   processing, credit, and data sharing. Disputes between eBay and us have
   arisen and others may arise in the future; an adverse outcome in such
   matters could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
   operations, and financial condition. If either we or eBay are unable to
   satisfy our performance, payment, or indemnification obligations under
   these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or
   be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to
   eBay.

   Our relationship with eBay is governed, in part, by an operating
   agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years
   (expiring July 2020). This operating agreement defines a number of
   important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as
   certain obligations and restrictions that limit PayPal's provision of
   services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as
   specified in the operating agreement). eBay remains a significant
   source of our revenues and operating income. We expect the portion of
   our revenue and operating income attributable to eBay to continue to
   decline due to various factors (many of which are beyond our control),
   including the expiration (or earlier termination) of the operating
   agreement with eBay, and the extent to which eBay intermediates
   payments on its platform (including by acting as a merchant of record),
   limits the availability of PayPal as a payment option or offers (or
   promotes) alternative payment options, directs transactions on its
   platforms to different providers of payment services, or eliminates or
   modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its
   platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reduction in
   eBay volume, and other consequences adverse to our business. If we are
   unable to generate sufficient business from our non-eBay customers to
   offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business
   attributable to eBay, it could materially impact the growth in our
   business and our ability to meet our long-term financial targets.

   Risks Related to Our Common Stock

   The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to
   fluctuate significantly.

   The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to
   fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may
   be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:

   o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

   o changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and
   recommendations or lack of coverage and reports by securities analysts;

   o changes in our capital structure;

   o the activities of our competitors;

   o speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment
   community;

   o the operating and stock price performance and valuation of comparable
   companies;

   o our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our
   industry;

   o the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public
   announcements, and our filings with the SEC;

   o additions or departures of key personnel;

   o announcements related to litigation, regulation, or disputes;

   o changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we
   operate; and

   o market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries
   of merchants, and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.

   As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock
   may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which
   they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in
   general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
   often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance
   of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may
   materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of
   our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies
   that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been
   subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit
   against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on
   our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as it
   could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management's
   attention and resources.

   Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the
   state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in
   the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the
   District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types
   of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders,
   which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and
   officers.

   Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that
   unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the
   State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of
   Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of
   Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative
   action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a
   claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or
   officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim
   against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any
   provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") or our
   amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any
   action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers
   governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum
   provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in
   a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes
   with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such
   lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a
   court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision
   inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the
   specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could
   incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other
   jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial
   condition, or results of operations.

   Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our
   company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.

   Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of
   deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by
   making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and
   by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of
   Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions
   include, among others:

   o rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate
   directors for election at stockholder meetings;

   o the fact that directors may not be elected, removed, or replaced at
   stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity, or
   group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;

   o the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to
   determine the voting, dividend, and other rights of preferred stock
   without stockholder approval;

   o the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies
   on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the
   size of our board of directors;

   o the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and

   o the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.

   We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL,
   which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that
   acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15%
   of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not
   engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by
   merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a
   three-year period following the date on which that person or its
   affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's
   outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors
   Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold
   instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could
   delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.

   While these provisions are not intended to make us immune from
   takeovers, they will apply even if the offer may be considered
   beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition
   that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of
   us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or
   discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.

   Common Stock

   PayPal common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the
   ticker symbol "PYPL."

   As of January 31, 2019, there were approximately 3,824 holders of
   record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is
   significantly greater than this number of record holders, and includes
   stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in
   street name by brokers and other nominees.

   Dividend Policy

   We have never paid any cash dividends and we currently do not
   anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

   Stock Repurchase Activity

   In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
   program that provides for the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our
   common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This
   program became effective in December 2017 upon completion of a previous
   stock repurchase program. In July 2018, our Board of Directors
   authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the
   repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration
   from the date of authorization. This program will become effective upon
   completion of the April 2017 stock repurchase program. Our stock
   repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from
   our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and
   other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of
   our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share
   repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through
   open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated
   transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other
   means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, and
   will be funded from our cash from operations or other financing
   alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market
   conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any
   stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase
   programs at any time without notice.

   The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs
   during the three months ended December 31, 2018 is summarized as
   follows:

   ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements
   within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
   Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including

   "opportunity," "plan," "project," "forecast," and other similar
   expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and
   uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial
   condition to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our
   forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among
   others, those discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial
   statements, related notes, and the other information appearing
   elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and
   Exchange Commission ("SEC"). We do not intend, and undertake no
   obligation except as required by law, to update any of our

   Table of Contents

   Business Environment

   We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that
   enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and
   merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial
   services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the
   global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to
   manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any
   platform, and using any device. We also facilitate person-to-person
   ("P2P") payments through our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. Our
   combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit,
   Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products, compose our proprietary
   Payments Platform.

   We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment
   characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the
   payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened
   as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as
   countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy,
   cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and
   regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws
   and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the
   advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through
   legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or
   changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations
   are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and
   enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material
   adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial
   condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design
   compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

   Information security risks for global payments and technology companies
   like us have significantly increased in recent years. We are not immune
   to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer
   such losses in the future. For additional information regarding our
   information security risks, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the
   caption--"Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in
   serious harm to our reputation, business and financial condition."

   The United Kingdom ("U.K.") held a referendum in June 2016 in which a
   majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU")
   (commonly referred to as "Brexit"). In March 2017, the U.K. government
   initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty on European
   Union, which commenced a two-year period expiring on March 29, 2019,
   after which time the U.K. is expected to leave the EU in the absence of
   any effective extension to the Article 50 period. Political
   negotiations are underway; however, there is a significant lack of
   clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the terms of
   the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU. The U.K.'s financial
   service regulators are implementing Temporary Permission Regimes
   ("TPR") that are expected to be put in place by the U.K.'s government
   to support European Economic Area ("EEA") financial service firms in
   continuing to conduct business in the U.K. should the U.K. exit the EU
   without an agreement. The final TPR rules are expected to be published
   in the first quarter of 2019 and will come into effect when the U.K.
   leaves the EU. Accordingly, we may need to adjust our business to
   comply with additional legal and regulatory requirements if accessing
   the TPR. We are currently unable to determine the impact
   that Brexit will have on our business, as any impact will depend, in
   part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other
   negotiations. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our
   business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the caption--"The United
   Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us."

   Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and
   worldwide economic and market conditions, and could contribute to
   instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including
   volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign
   exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the
   impact from foreign currency rate movements.

   In 2018, 2017, and 2016, net revenues generated from our U.K.
   operations constituted 11%, 11% and 12%, respectively, of total net
   revenues. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, net revenues generated from the EU
   (excluding the U.K.) constituted less than 20% of total net revenues.
   Approximately 31% and 30% of our gross loans and interest receivables
   as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated from our
   U.K. operations. Approximately 7% and 5% of our gross loans and
   interest receivables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively,
   were generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) operations.

   Net revenues increased $2.4 billion, or 18%, in 2018 and $2.3 billion,
   or 21%, in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by growth in TPV (as
   defined below under "Net Revenues") of 27% in 2018 and 27% in 2017. Net
   revenues from our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively
   contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in
   2018. The increase from the impact of acquisitions was offset by a
   decrease in interest and fee income due to the sale of our U.S.
   consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank in July 2018,
   which resulted in a negative impact of approximately four percentage
   points to the net revenues growth rate in 2018. In 2017, net revenues
   from our acquisitions of TIO and Swift were not material.

   Total operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, in 2018 and
   $1.7 billion, or 18%, in 2017. The increase in 2018 was due primarily
   to an increase in transaction expense, general and administrative,
   transaction and loan loss, sales and marketing, and restructuring and
   other expenses. Operating expenses related to our acquisitions
   completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately three
   percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in
   2018. In March 2018, management decided to wind down TIO's operations.
   The increase in total operating expense in 2017 was due primarily to an
   increase in transaction expense, sales and marketing, general and
   administrative, product development, and restructuring and other
   charges. Operating expenses related to TIO and Swift collectively
   contributed one percentage point to the 2017 growth rate.

   Operating income increased $67 million, or 3%, in 2018 and increased
   $541 million, or 34% in 2017. Operating income increased in 2018 and
   2017 due primarily to the increase in net revenues, offset by the
   growth in operating expenses. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and
   2017 collectively had a negative impact of approximately seven
   percentage points to the 2018 growth rate in operating income. Our
   acquisitions in 2017 collectively had a negative impact of four
   percentage points on our 2017 growth rate in operating income. Our
   operating margin was 14%, 16%, and 15% in 2018, 2017, and 2016,
   respectively. Operating margin in 2018 was negatively impacted by
   growth in our transaction expense, which increased 26% in 2018,
   compared to net revenues, which increased 18% in the same period, as
   well as the negative impact of acquisitions. These impacts in 2018 were
   partially offset by operating efficiencies in our business. Operating
   margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction
   expense, which increased 32% in 2017, compared to net revenues, which
   increased 21% in the same period, as well as restructuring expense of
   $40 million incurred in 2017. These impacts in 2017 were offset by
   operating efficiencies in our business, and a one-time benefit of $322
   million pertaining to reversal of allowances related to loans and
   interest receivables due to the designation as held for sale of our
   U.S. consumer credit portfolio in November 2017.

   Net income increased by $262 million, or 15%, in 2018 and $394 million,
   or 28%, in 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 was attributable to
   an increase in operating income of $67 million and an increase in other
   income (expense), net of $109 million, which was driven by unrealized
   gains on equity investments and an increase in interest income,
   partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in
   net income was further impacted by a decrease in income tax expense of
   $86 million, primarily driven by a reduction in net tax expense
   recognized with respect to the Tax Act, partially offset by an increase
   in tax expense due to the increase in operating income and other income
   (expense), net. The increase in net income in 2017 was attributable to
   an increase in operating income of $541 million and an increase in
   other income (expense), net of $28 million, partially offset by an
   increase in income tax expense of $175 million.

   Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

   We have significant international operations that are denominated in
   foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk
   which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or
   weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we
   conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our
   net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into
   the U.S. dollar. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we generated approximately
   46%, 46% and 47% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside
   of the United States, respectively. Because we have generated
   substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including
   during the periods presented, we are subject to the risks of doing
   business in countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under "Item 1A.
   Risk Factors--Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of
   Operations and Financial Condition."

   We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on
   our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied
   to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in
   foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a
   foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we
   designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow
   hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency
   exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency
   exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction
   revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact
   earnings.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the year-over-year
   foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the
   following impact on our reported results:

   While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce
   the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements,
   it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this
   exposure.

   Additionally, in connection with our services that are paid for in
   multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange
   rates daily, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our
   foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in
   foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our
   foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign
   currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in
   currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we
   have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management
   program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset
   the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets
   and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our
   assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and
   are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange
   contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not
   entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
   movements on our assets and liabilities.

   Financial Results

   Net revenues

   Due to the diversification of PayPal's business through strategic
   partnerships, new products, and acquisitions, in the first quarter of
   2018, we updated our definitions of "active accounts" and "total
   payment volume (TPV)" as described below.

   Active Accounts: An active account is an account registered directly
   with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a
   transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive
   transactions, within the past 12 months. The definition of active
   accounts has been expanded to include payments made or outstanding
   balances held on our co-branded credit card program. The definition has
   also been expanded to include accounts from our platform access
   partners. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers
   are provided access to PayPal's Payments Platform through such third
   party's login credentials. This expanded definition captures uniquely
   identifiable accounts for which PayPal receives economic benefits for
   completed transactions processed on behalf of customers who have
   established a relationship with PayPal.

   Total Payment Volume: The value of payments, net of reversals,
   successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal
   via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive
   transactions. The definition of TPV has been expanded to include
   PayPal's diversification into new partner payment solutions such as
   certain tokenized transactions and contextual commerce which expand our
   opportunities for growth.

   The revised definition also captures TPV from our merchant debit card
   program. Due to their inclusion in TPV, revenues from these
   transactions were reclassified from "other value added services" to
   "transaction revenues" with no change to "total net revenues."

   These revisions also impacted previously reported results for other
   non-financial key performance metrics, including number of payment
   transactions and payment transactions per active account. Prior period
   metrics have been revised in this filing to conform to the new
   definitions.

   43
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:



   o Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and
   consumers on a transaction basis primarily based on the volume of
   activity, or TPV, completed on our Payments Platform. Growth in TPV is
   directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable
   on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of
   payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our
   Payments Platform, or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution
   not including gateway-exclusive transactions. We earn additional fees
   on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable
   cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or
   consumer are in different countries).

   o Other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from
   revenue earned through partnerships, subscription fees, gateway fees,
   and other services we provide to our merchants and customers. We also
   earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our PayPal
   credit portfolio of loans receivable, gain on sale of participation
   interest in certain loans and advances, and interest earned on certain
   PayPal customer account balances.

   Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:



   o The mix of merchants, products, and services;

   o The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;

   o The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and

   o The amount of our credit loans receivable outstanding with merchants
   and consumers.

   The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31,

   Transaction revenues

   Transaction revenues increased by $2.2 billion, or 19%, in 2018
   compared to 2017, and by $1.9 billion, or 20%, in 2017 compared to
   2016. The increase in transaction revenues in 2018 and 2017 was due
   primarily to the growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal and Braintree
   products, and in the number of payment transactions, both of which
   resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts. Current
   year acquisitions did not have a material impact on the growth rate of
   transaction revenues; however, they contributed approximately 2.9
   million new active accounts during the year. Net losses from our
   foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of
   transaction revenues in 2018 were $23 million, compared to net gains of
   $17 million in 2017. Refer to "Note 10--Derivative Instruments" to our
   consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency

   ** Not meaningful

   Transaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and number of
   payment transactions in 2018 due to a higher proportion of P2P
   transactions (primarily from our PayPal and Venmo products) from which
   we earn lower fees and a lower proportion of cross border transactions.
   Transaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and the number of
   payment transactions in 2017 due primarily to a higher proportion of
   P2P transactions, primarily from our PayPal and Venmo products. The
   impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did
   not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2018 or 2017.

   Other value added services

   Net revenues from other value added services increased by $149 million,
   or 9%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and by $336 million, or 27%, in 2017
   compared to 2016. Growth in net revenues from other value-added
   services in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to interest and fee income
   earned on our loans receivable portfolio. In 2018, net revenue from
   other value added services was also positively impacted by growth in
   interest earned on customer balances. The completion of the sale of our
   U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018 resulted in
   lower interest and fee income in the second half of 2018, partially
   offset by an increase in revenue share with Synchrony Bank and
   approximately $109 million of revenue earned from transition servicing
   activities. Swift revenues contributed approximately nine percentage
   points and three percentage points to the 2018 and 2017 growth rates,
   respectively.The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance,
   including loans and receivables, held for sale, as of December 31,
   2018, 2017, and 2016 was $2.7 billion, $7.8 billion, and $5.7 billion,
   respectively, which reflected a year-over-year decrease of 66% in 2018
   compared to 2017, and an increase of 37% in 2017 compared to 2016. The
   decline in 2018 was primarily driven by the completion of the sale of
   U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio.

   In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer
   credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank to free up balance sheet
   capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk.
   Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal
   balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro rata
   allowances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and
   estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval by our Board of
   Directors of the decision to sell these receivables, the portfolio was
   reclassified as held for sale, and recorded at the lower of cost or
   fair value. Due to the designation as held for sale, the associated
   allowance for this portfolio was reversed, resulting in an increase of
   approximately $39 million in revenue from other value added services in
   2017.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Following the closing of this transaction in July 2018, Synchrony Bank
   became the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer
   financing program in the U.S., and we no longer hold an ownership
   interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than
   receivables that have been or are designated to be charged off and are
   fully reserved). The transaction was accounted for as a true sale, and
   following the completion of the sale, the receivables are no longer
   reported on our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the
   sale, we earn a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables
   owned by Synchrony Bank, which is recorded in net revenues from other
   value added services. We expect this transaction to negatively impact
   other value-added services revenue growth for the first two quarters of
   2019. The corresponding negative impact on total net revenue growth
   rate for each of those quarters is expected to be between 6% and 8%,
   although this estimate is subject to various uncertainties and the
   actual impact may be different.

   Transaction expense

   Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to
   accept a customer's funding source of payment. These costs include fees
   paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to
   draw funds from a customer's credit or debit card, bank account, or
   other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet.
   Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to
   enable a transaction. We refer to the allocation of funding sources
   used by our consumers as our "funding mix." The cost of funding a
   transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the
   cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources
   such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the
   availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our
   customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease
   our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also
   impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction
   occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded
   with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S.

   Transaction expense increased by $1.2 billion, or 26%, in 2018 compared
   to 2017, and increased by $1.1 billion, or 32%, in 2017 compared to
   2016. The increase in transaction expense in 2018 was primarily
   attributable to an increase in TPV of 27%. The increase in transaction
   expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 27%
   and higher assessments charged by payment processors and other
   financial institutions.

   The transaction expense rate in 2018 remained relatively consistent
   with the transaction expense rate for 2017. The increase in our
   transaction expense rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to
   higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial
   institutions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016,
   approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years
   ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 43%, 43%, and
   44% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S.

   Transaction and loan losses

   Transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and
   seller protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include
   the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable
   portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held for sale. Our
   transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors,
   including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer
   protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit
   quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our
   credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants.

   The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended
   December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows:

   ^(1) Transaction loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction losses
   by TPV. Prior year rates were revised to reflect updated TPV
   definition, as discussed above.

   Transaction and loan losses increased by $263 million, or 26%, in 2018
   compared to 2017, and decreased by $77 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared
   to 2016.

   Transaction losses increased by $236 million, or 29%, in 2018 compared
   to 2017, and increased by $168 million, or 26%, in 2017 compared to
   2016, due primarily to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate remained
   flat in 2018, 2017, and 2016.

   Loan losses increased by $27 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to 2017
   and decreased by $245 million, or 57%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The
   increase in loan losses in 2018 was primarily due to the increase in
   our merchant loans and advances receivable balances, partially offset
   by a decline resulting from the sale of our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables portfolio in the third quarter of 2018 and the portfolio's
   designation as held for sale during the first two quarters of 2018. The
   decrease in loan losses in 2017 was due primarily to the reversal of
   approximately $283 million of allowance on loans receivable due to the
   designation of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale.

   The consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2018, 2017,
   and 2016 was $704 million, $326 million, and $5.1 billion,
   respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 116% from 2017 to
   2018 and a decrease of 94% from 2016 to 2017. The increase in consumer
   loan receivables in 2018 was due to growth in international markets.
   Approximately 93% of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of
   December 31 2018 and December 31, 2017 were due from consumers in the
   U.K. The decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017 was due to the
   designation of U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale.

   We offer business financing solutions to certain small- and
   medium-sized merchants. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest
   and fees receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and
   2016, net of participation interest sold, were $1.9 billion, $1.0
   billion, and $558 million, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year
   increase of 85% from 2017 to 2018 and an increase of 81% from 2016 to
   2017. The increase in merchant receivables in 2018 was due to growth in
   our PayPal Business Loan ("PPBL") portfolio and an increase in the
   availability of our PayPal Working Capital ("PPWC") product.
   Approximately 87% and 10% of our merchant receivables outstanding as of
   December 31 2018 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K. as
   compared to 83% and 13% as of December 31, 2017, respectively. The
   increase in merchant receivables in 2017 was due to the acquisition of
   Swift, which included their pre-existing loan receivables portfolio,
   and an increase in the availability of our PPWC product domestically
   and internationally.

   Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit
   products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on
   our loans and interest receivables. For additional information, see
   "Note 11--Loans and Interest Receivable" in the notes to the
   consolidated financial statements, and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under
   the caption--"Some of our credit products expose us to additional
   risks." included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Customer support and operations

   Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to
   provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations, and
   other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform,
   costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our
   merchants and consumers, and other costs incurred related to the
   delivery of our products.

   Customer support and operations costs increased $118 million, or 9%, in
   2018 compared to 2017 and increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2017
   compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily attributable to an
   increase in employee-related expenses and platform infrastructure
   expenses to support the growth in our active accounts and the number of
   payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform, partially
   offset by a decrease in contractor and consulting expenses. Our
   acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed
   approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2018. The
   increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in network
   infrastructure expenses and contractor and employee related expenses to
   support the growth in our active accounts and the number of payment
   transactions occurring on our Payments Platform.

   Sales and marketing

   Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition,
   business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee
   compensation and contractor costs to support these programs.

   Sales and marketing expenses increased $185 million, or 16%, in 2018
   compared to 2017 and increased $159 million, or 16%, in 2017 compared
   to 2016. The increase in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to higher
   employee-related expense and higher spend on external marketing
   campaigns. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively
   contributed approximately seven percentage points to the growth rate in
   2018.

   Product development

   Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation
   and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the
   development of our Payments Platform, new products, and the improvement
   of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software
   and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of
   developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization
   expense.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Product development expenses increased $118 million, or 12%, in 2018
   compared to 2017 and increased $119 million, or 14%, in 2017 compared
   to 2016. The increase in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to an increase
   in employee-related expenses. The increase in 2018 was also
   attributable to an increase in contractor and consulting expenses. Our
   acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed
   approximately two percentage points to the growth rate in 2018.

   General and administrative

   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred
   to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources,
   finance, risk and compliance, executive, and other support operations.
   Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal and
   regulatory proceedings, settlements, judgments, and fines, may
   fluctuate substantially from period to period.

   General and administrative expenses increased $296 million, or 26%, in
   2018 compared to 2017 and increased $127 million, or 12%, in 2017
   compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 was due primarily to an increase
   in employee-related expenses, professional service expenses, and
   facilities cost. Additional expenses incurred to support our mergers
   and acquisitions and the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables
   portfolio also contributed to the growth rate in 2018. Our acquisitions
   completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately five
   percentage points to the growth rate in 2018. The increase in 2017 was
   due primarily to an increase in employee-related expenses and
   professional service expenses, and continued investments in compliance
   programs.

   Depreciation and amortization

   The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses
   include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the
   amortization of capitalized software and website development costs,
   depreciation of equipment used to deliver our services, and
   amortization of acquired intangible assets.

   Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $29 million, or 4%, in
   2018 compared to 2017, and increased $81 million, or 11%, in 2017
   compared to 2016. The decrease in 2018 was primarily attributable to
   fully depreciated assets partially offset by an increase in
   amortization of acquired intangibles due to acquisitions completed in
   2018 and 2017, which contributed seven percentage points to the growth
   rate. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to additional depreciation
   expenses associated with investments in our technology platform.
   Additionally, the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 was
   partially attributable to an impairment charge of $30 million related
   to a portion of our acquired TIO customer-related intangible assets.
   For additional information, see "Note 5--Goodwill and Intangible
   Assets" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
   this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Restructuring and other charges

   Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring
   expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables,
   held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges increased by
   $177 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase of $152
   million in cost adjustments, which were primarily driven by charge-offs
   against loans and interest receivables, held for sale portfolio, prior
   to its sale in July 2018, and a net loss of $40 million incurred at the
   conclusion of this sale. Restructuring and other charges increased by
   $132 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to restructuring charges of
   $40 million and cost adjustments of $92 million, which were driven by
   charge-offs against our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio
   subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017.

   In the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, management approved strategic
   reductions of the existing global workforce, which resulted in
   restructuring charges of $25 million and $40 million, respectively. The
   reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 also included
   restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down TIO
   operations. We incurred employee and severance benefits expenses under
   both the 2018 and 2017 strategic reductions, which were substantially
   completed by the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively. No restructuring
   expenses were recognized in 2016.

   Other income (expense), net

   Other income (expense), net increased $109 million, or 149%, in 2018
   compared to 2017, and increased $28 million, or 62%, in 2017 compared
   to 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily driven by net unrealized
   gains on equity investments due to the favorable impact of observable
   price changes, which contributed $86 million (including $55 million in
   the fourth quarter). Additionally, the increase was attributable to
   growth in interest income of $83 million due to higher interest rates
   and increase in corporate cash, partially offset by an increase of $70
   million in interest expense associated with higher amounts of notes
   payable outstanding under our credit agreements. The increase in 2017
   was primarily driven by an increase in interest income.

   Income tax expense

   On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs
   Act (the "Tax Act"). The Tax Act included significant changes to the
   U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate
   reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest
   expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such
   as the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("BEAT") and Global Intangible Low
   Taxed Income ("GILTI") tax; and the transition of U.S. international
   taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax
   system, which resulted in a one time U.S. tax liability on those
   earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the
   "Transition Tax").

   In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act,
   we recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $180
   million for the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense
   consisted of provisional estimates of $1,468 million net expense for
   the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295
   million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on
   unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for
   remeasurement of our deferred tax assets/liabilities for the corporate
   rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

   During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting
   for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We recognized additional
   discrete net tax expense of $20 million to the provisional amounts
   recorded at December 31, 2017 for the enactment-date effects of the Tax
   Act, for a total of $200 million of discrete net tax expense. The $200
   million of total discrete net expense consists of $1,490 million of net
   federal and state Transition Tax, the majority of which is payable in
   installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the
   decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings,
   and $5 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets
   and liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our
   valuation allowance. We elected to account for GILTI as a
   current-period expense when incurred. Legislation and clarifying
   guidance is expected to continue to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and
   various states in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on
   the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant
   changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and
   current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense.

   Our effective tax rate was 13% in 2018, 18% in 2017, and 14% in 2016.
   The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 was primarily due to a
   favorable shift in earnings and discrete net tax expense recorded for
   U.S. tax reform in 2017, partially offset by reduced tax benefits for
   U.S. expenses in 2018 due to the lower U.S. tax rate. The increase in
   our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to discrete net tax
   expense recorded for U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the adoption
   of the new stock-based compensation accounting standard in 2017. See
   "Note 16--Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements
   included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more
   information on our effective tax rate.

   Non-GAAP Financial Information

   Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a
   company's performance that excludes or includes amounts that create
   differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and
   presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
   principles ("GAAP"). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K,
   the following portion of this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
   Financial Condition and Results of Operations" includes a
   reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most
   directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of
   non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as
   a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with
   GAAP.

   We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor's
   evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful
   comparisons of our results between periods. Management uses these
   non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things: evaluate our
   operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes, and in the
   calculation of performance-based compensation.

   We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net
   income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating
   margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:

   50
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes.
   This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive
   plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP
   measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related
   employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing
   and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which
   management has limited to no control, and as such management does not
   believe it correlates to the operation of our business.

   o Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment
   of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal
   of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired
   intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may
   incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the
   acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these
   amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because
   management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing
   operating results.

   o Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and
   other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges
   primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of
   our ongoing operating results.

   o Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that
   are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant
   gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result
   of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently
   in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We
   exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does
   not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results.

   o Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to
   present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above
   on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net
   income.

   The following tables provide reconciliations of our consolidated
   non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
   financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and

   cash flow to assess our performance. Free cash flow represents cash
   flows from operating activities less purchases of property and
   equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that
   provides useful information to management and investors about the
   amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of
   property and equipment, and investments in our Payments Platform, which
   can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make
   strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the
   utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that
   it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash
   balance for the period. A reconciliation of free cash flow to the most
   directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented below:

   Liquidity and Capital Resources

   We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global
   operations, including customer protection programs, our credit
   products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential
   acquisitions, working capital, and other cash needs. The following
   table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of
   December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

   December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and equity
   investments of $293 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2018 and
   December 31, 2017, respectively.

   Foreign Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

   Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries
   were $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $6.1 billion at
   December 31, 2017, or 89% and 81% of our total cash, cash equivalents,
   and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2018, all
   of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign
   subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, GILTI, or
   the one-time Transition Tax as further discussed in "Note 16--Income
   Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
   this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations will not be
   taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to
   state or foreign withholding tax. A significant aspect of our global
   cash management activities involves meeting our customers' requirements
   to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory
   financial ratios commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash
   balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our
   businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements
   across our regulated subsidiaries. As such, not all of our cash is
   available for general corporate purposes.

   Credit Facilities

   In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement
   ("2017 Credit Agreement") that provided for an unsecured $3.0 billion,
   364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was available in
   up to three borrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into
   an amended credit agreement ("Amended Credit Agreement") which amends
   and restates in its entirety the 2017 Credit Agreement. The Amended
   Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, 364-day
   delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to
   four separate borrowings. Funds borrowed under the Amended Credit
   Agreement may be used to repurchase equity securities from
   shareholders, to repay intercompany debt, and for other general
   corporate purposes of the Company and our subsidiaries. Amounts
   available under the Amended Credit Agreement may be borrowed until
   April 2019, subject to customary borrowing conditions, and the Amended
   Credit Agreement will terminate in November 2019.

   In the first quarter of 2018, we effected two drawdowns aggregating to
   $2.0 billion under the 2017 Credit Agreement, which were in addition to
   the outstanding balance of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. In the
   second quarter of 2018, we repaid $1.0 billion of the borrowings
   outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The borrowings outstanding
   as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 bore interest at LIBOR of one month
   plus a margin of 1.125% resulting in a weighted average interest rate
   of 3.34% and 2.78%, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion
   was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at
   December 31, 2018, $3.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available in
   up to four drawdowns for the purposes permitted by the Amended Credit
   Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

   In 2015, we entered into a credit agreement ("2015 Credit Agreement"
   and, collectively with the Amended Credit Agreement, the "Credit
   Agreements") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year
   revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit
   sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available
   borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of
   any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to
   time. We may, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders,
   increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to
   $500 million. Funds borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement may be
   used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
   general corporate purposes. The 2015 Credit Agreement will terminate in
   July 2020.

   53
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the
   2015 Credit Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of
   2017. The borrowing bore interest at LIBOR of one month plus a margin
   of 1.125% resulting in a weighted-average interest rate of 2.36%. As of
   December 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding
   under the 2015 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018,
   $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes
   permitted by the 2015 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions
   to borrowing.

   We also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions
   throughout the world, with borrowing capacity of approximately $300
   million in the aggregate. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary
   by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong
   credit ratings. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding
   under these facilities, and therefore, approximately $300 million of
   borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to
   borrowing.

   For additional information regarding the terms of our credit
   facilities, refer to "Note 12--Notes Payable" to our consolidated
   financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
   10-K.

   We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for
   cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals
   from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash
   balances held within the financial institution ("Aggregate Cash
   Deposits"). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts
   exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The
   net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used
   by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net
   interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31,
   2018, we had a total of $4.3 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our
   $4.3 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial
   institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

   Liquidity for Credit Portfolio Growth

   Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity
   needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely
   affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third
   party sources of funding of our credit portfolio. In June 2018, the
   Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the "CSSF")
   agreed that PayPal's management may designate up to 35% of European
   customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used
   to extend credit for European and U.S. credit activities. As of
   December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount approved by management to be
   designated for credit activities aggregated to $1.5 billion and
   represented approximately 26% of European customer balances potentially
   available for corporate use by us at that date as determined by
   applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. No additional
   amount has been designated for corporate usage by management during the
   year ended December 31, 2018. We may periodically seek to designate
   additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on
   utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding
   requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit
   products with capital from external sources, although there can be no
   assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under
   certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called
   upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.

   In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer
   credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically, this
   portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any
   participation interest sold and pro rata allowances including,
   unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible
   interest and fees. In July 2018, we completed the transaction for total
   consideration of $6.9 billion, which includes cash consideration of
   $6.5 billion and a long-term receivable in the amount of $426 million,
   which was recorded at that time at its present value of $261 million.
   Following the closing of this transaction, Synchrony Bank became the
   exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit online consumer financing program
   in the U.S., and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the
   receivables generated through the program (other than charged off or
   designated to be charged off receivables).

   Credit Ratings

   As of December 31, 2018, we continue to be rated investment grade by
   Standard and Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We
   expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our
   performance, including our capital structure and results of operations.
   Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change,
   there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being
   downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that
   were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the
   interest rate on loans under the Credit Agreements.

   Risk of Loss

   The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are
   specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may
   also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or
   modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in
   regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these
   consolidated financial statements included in this report, our
   transaction loss rates, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV,
   was 0.18% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future
   results.

   Acquisitions and Stock Repurchases

   In July 2018, we completed our acquisition of Simility for
   approximately $107 million in cash. We acquired Simility to enhance our
   ability to deliver fraud prevention and risk management solutions to
   merchants globally.

   In September 2018, we completed our acquisition of iZettle for
   approximately $2.1 billion in cash (net of cash acquired of $103
   million) and $22 million in equity. We acquired iZettle to expand our
   in-store presence and strengthen our Payments Platform to help small
   businesses around the world grow and thrive in an omnichannel retail
   environment.

   In November 2018, we completed our acquisition of Hyperwallet for
   approximately $399 million in cash. We acquired Hyperwallet to enhance
   our payout capabilities and improve our ability to provide an
   integrated suite of payment solutions to ecommerce platforms and
   marketplaces around the world.

   During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased
   approximately $2.5 billion of our common stock through open market
   repurchases and approximately $1.0 billion pursuant to an accelerated
   share repurchase agreement under our stock repurchase programs. As
   of December 31, 2018, a total of approximately $11.5 billion remained
   available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock
   repurchase programs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we
   repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock under our
   stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, a total of
   approximately $5.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of
   our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Our programs are
   intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation
   programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also
   be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce
   outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock
   repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block
   trades, privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share
   repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as
   management deems appropriate, and will be funded from cash from
   operations or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock
   repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties
   and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We
   may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice.

   Other Considerations

   Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be
   adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial
   performance and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad
   range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital,
   and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of
   any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See
   "Item 1A. Risk Factors--Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business,
   Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Note
   13--Commitments and Contingencies" to our consolidated financial
   statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
   additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.

   We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments,
   cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access
   to capital markets, together with potential external funding through
   third party sources, will be sufficient to fund our operating
   activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and our credit products
   for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may from
   time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to
   fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, repurchase shares
   under our share repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital.

   Operating Activities

   Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for
   certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses
   recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual
   cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and
   liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include
   depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash
   impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is
   reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and
   liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized
   during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of
   probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products
   (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November
   2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and
   merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio
   from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating
   activities.

   We generated cash from operating activities of $5.5 billion in 2018
   primarily due to operating income of approximately $2.2 billion and the
   positive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in the loans and interest
   receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer
   credit receivables portfolio. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of
   depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were
   approximately $1.6 billion during 2018. Adjustments for non-cash
   expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were
   approximately $1.3 billion and cost basis adjustments to loans and
   interest receivable held for sale were $244 million during 2018. The
   cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by
   changes in other assets and liabilities of $708 million, primarily
   related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period.

   We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2017 due
   primarily to operating income of approximately $2.1 billion.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and
   stock-based compensation were approximately $1.5 billion during 2017.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for
   transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.0 billion during
   2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively
   impacted by adjustments for non-cash expenses related to deferred
   income taxes of approximately $1.3 billion during 2017. The cash
   generated from operating activities was also negatively impacted by
   changes in working capital primarily related to loans and interest
   receivable held for sale, net of $1.3 billion due to changes in the
   presentation of originations and collections on loans within the U.S.
   consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for
   sale in November 2017, which were presented in operating activities
   instead of investing activities, offset by changes in other assets and
   liabilities of $634 million. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit
   portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will
   continue to be reflected in investing activities.

   We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due
   primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and
   stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from
   stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for
   transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during
   2016. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively
   impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction
   loss allowance for cash losses, net.

   Cash paid for income taxes in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $328 million,
   $117 million, and $48 million, respectively.

   Investing Activities

   Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and
   sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions, purchases and sales
   of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, and
   funds receivable.

   56
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We generated cash from investing activities of $840 million in 2018 due
   primarily to maturities and sales of investments of $21.9 billion,
   changes in principal loans receivable, net of $3.1 billion, and changes
   in funds receivable from customers of $1.1 billion. These cash inflows
   were offset by purchases of investments of $22.4 billion, acquisitions
   of $2.1 billion (net of cash and restricted cash acquired), and
   purchases of property and equipment of $823 million.

   The net cash used in investing activities of $4.5 billion in 2017 was
   due primarily to purchases of investments of $19.4 billion, an increase
   in funds receivable of $1.6 billion (including the reclassification of
   $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg
   banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents), changes in principal
   loans receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our
   consumer and merchant credit products (excluding originations and
   collections pertaining to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and
   after November 2017 which are presented in operating activities), of
   $920 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $323 million, and
   purchases of property and equipment of $667 million. These net cash
   outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4
   billion. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for
   originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be
   reflected in investing activities.

   The net cash used in investing activities of $5.9 billion in 2016 was
   due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.0 billion, increases
   in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated
   through our PayPal credit products of $1.5 billion, purchases of
   property and equipment of $669 million and net increases in funds
   receivable of $1.1 billion, including the reclassification of $800
   million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking
   subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were
   offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion.

   Financing Activities

   Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of
   common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to
   net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under
   financing arrangements, funds payable and amounts due to customers, and
   excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (for periods prior to
   2017).

   The net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2018 was
   due primarily to the repurchase of $3.5 billion of our common stock
   under our stock repurchase programs, repayments of borrowings under
   financing arrangements of $1.1 billion, and tax withholdings related to
   net share settlement of equity awards of $419 million, partially offset
   by cash inflows from borrowings under financing arrangements of $2.1
   billion and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of
   $1.6 billion.

   The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.1 billion in 2017
   was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to
   customers of $4.3 billion and borrowings of $1.8 billion. These cash
   inflows were partially offset by repayments of borrowings of $980
   million (including a loan of $170 million assumed in connection with
   our acquisition of Swift), the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common
   stock under our stock repurchase programs, and tax withholdings related
   to net share settlement of equity awards of $166 million.



   The net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016
   was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to
   customers of $3.0 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995
   million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.

   Free Cash Flow

   We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less
   purchases of property and equipment.

   Free cash flow was $4.7 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.8 billion
   from 2017. The increase in free cash flow during the period was due to
   an increase in cash generated from operating activities of $3.0
   billion, which was primarily impacted by changes in the loans and
   interest receivable held for sale, net, due to the completion of the
   sale of that portfolio, partially offset by purchases of property and
   equipment, which were $156 million higher compared to the prior year.
   Free cash flow generated during 2018 was used for repurchasing our
   common stock under our stock repurchase programs, funding our credit
   portfolio, acquisitions, and general business purposes.

   Free cash flow was $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of $625 million
   from 2016. The decrease in free cash flow during the period was
   primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of $627
   million, which was impacted by the change in presentation from
   investing activities to operating activities of originations and
   collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its
   designation as held for sale in November 2017. Free cash flow generated
   during 2017 was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock
   repurchase programs, funding our credit portfolio, acquisitions, and
   general business purposes.

   57
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial
   Information" for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP
   financial measure.

   Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

   We had a negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash, cash
   equivalents, and restricted cash during 2018 of $113 million, due to
   the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign
   currencies, primarily the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent, the
   Euro. The positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash, cash
   equivalents, and restricted cash during 2017 of $36 million was due to
   the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies,
   primarily the Euro. Currency exchange rates did not have a material
   impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2016.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet
   arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
   future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
   of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

   Future Liquidity and Obligations

   As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.8 billion of unused credit
   was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $26.4
   billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2017. While this amount
   represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced,
   and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit account holders will
   access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In
   addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused
   credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on, among
   other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. The decrease
   in unused credit in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to the sale of our
   U.S. consumer credit portfolio.

   Prior to the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables portfolio in July 2018, when a consumer funded a purchase
   in the U.S. using a PayPal credit product issued by a chartered
   financial institution, the chartered financial institution extended
   credit to the consumer, funded the extension of credit at the point of
   sale, and advanced funds to the merchant. We purchased the receivables
   related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial
   institution and, as a result of such purchase, bore the risk of loss in
   the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial
   institution continued to own each customer account, we owned the
   related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and were
   responsible for all servicing functions related to the account.
   Subsequent to the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables portfolio in July 2018, we no longer purchase the
   receivables related to U.S. consumer loans extended by the chartered
   financial institution.

   We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that
   include future estimated payments for general operating purposes.
   Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions,
   fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual
   payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty
   regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table
   summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2018 that are expected to
   impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be
   able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment
   portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations.

   The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts
   presented in the above table are as follows:

   58
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for
   advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software
   applications, engineering development services and construction
   contracts), and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary
   course of business.

   o Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our
   non-cancelable operating leases primarily for office and data center
   facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms
   and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under
   our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs
   requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility
   early.

   o Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously
   deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act, as further discussed in
   "Note 16--Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements
   included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of
   liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above
   does not include $615 million of such non-current liabilities included
   in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated
   balance sheets as of December 31, 2018.

   Seasonality

   The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to
   net revenues. No individual quarter in 2018, 2017, or 2016 accounted
   for more than 30% of annual net revenue.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

   The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
   assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect
   our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies
   and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods
   used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are
   applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates
   and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to
   be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting
   estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate
   or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
   judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of
   outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial
   condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection,
   and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance
   Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting
   policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in
   "Note 1--Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to
   the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this
   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information
   is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides
   material information to investors. The amounts used to assess
   sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a
   general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do
   not represent management's predictions of variability. For all of these
   estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly
   as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

   Transaction and loan losses

   Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our
   customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses
   associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan
   losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV,
   macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs,
   the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans
   receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products,
   which include our PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and
   advances arising from our PPWC and PPBL products.

   We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from
   processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized
   credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of
   goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims,
   account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance,
   in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses
   in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored
   regularly and are updated based on actual claims data. The allowances
   are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including
   experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment
   patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.

   59
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents
   our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our merchant
   loans and advances and consumer loans receivable. Increases to the
   allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan
   losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation
   process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. In connection
   with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to
   Synchrony Bank, and the designation of that portfolio as held for sale
   in November 2017, we released corresponding allowances against those
   loans and interest receivable balances. No allowances were established
   on any newly originated U.S. consumer loan receivables from and after
   November 2017. Adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio, which
   are primarily driven by charge offs, are recorded in restructuring and
   other charges in our consolidated statements of income. For our
   consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreements with
   Synchrony Bank, consisting primarily of our international consumer
   receivables, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal
   balance delinquency rates ("roll rates"). Roll rates are the percentage
   of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of
   delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as
   external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of
   unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our
   consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current
   to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the
   principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be
   charged off. For merchant loans and advances receivable the allowance
   is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates,
   and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting
   model.

   The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily
   determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates
   to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to
   project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are
   probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is
   primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.
   Increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a
   reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statements of income.
   Increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a
   reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in
   our consolidated balance sheets.

   Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently
   uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current
   estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts
   become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or
   recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem
   appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance
   sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018,
   an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate
   would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately
   $127 million.

   Accounting for Income Taxes

   Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and
   tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions
   in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different
   interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing
   authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax
   expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating
   uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the
   balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is
   significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign
   earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our
   income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are
   taxed by the U.S. through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the
   new GILTI tax and BEAT or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment
   assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's
   judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations.

   Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes
   payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of
   temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
   assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax
   credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future
   tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected
   taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable
   temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax
   planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates
   that are based on a number of factors, including our historical
   experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the
   extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a
   valuation allowance.

   We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with
   U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an
   uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax
   position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
   based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
   recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then
   measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50
   percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We
   report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from
   uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
   U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the
   expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized
   in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize
   interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
   income tax expense.

   60
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions
   around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax
   position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally
   resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or
   the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we
   believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we
   reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an
   examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest,
   where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances.
   Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.

   Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, a
   one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have
   resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $24
   million.

   Loss Contingencies

   We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings, and
   investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory
   oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each
   significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the
   potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential
   regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be
   reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss.
   Significant judgment is required in both the determination of
   probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our
   judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory
   proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house
   and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these
   matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at
   the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the
   potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other
   violation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent
   uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple
   jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially
   different than the actual outcomes.

   Revenue Recognition

   Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the
   measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments
   and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and
   conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine
   the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether
   we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net
   revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide
   incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment
   to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to
   gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions
   and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.

   Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

   The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset
   impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and
   assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business
   combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired,
   liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired
   business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between
   assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment
   testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
   assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group
   of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or
   group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to
   be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
   These valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which do
   not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

   We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual
   basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under U.S. GAAP,
   the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
   allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar
   to the U.S. GAAP for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing
   these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and
   conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends,
   industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost
   factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors, and our
   market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it
   is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or
   indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying
   amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.

   Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the
   reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds
   the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or
   indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in
   the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting
   unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures:
   amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a
   current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques
   of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples
   of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.

   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

   Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on
   market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in
   market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
   and investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the
   implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and
   foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market
   risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.

   Interest Rate Risk

   We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment
   portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the
   customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as
   customer accounts.

   As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 78% and 39%,
   respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment
   portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying
   the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as
   customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing
   bank deposits, time deposits, U.S. and foreign government and agency
   securities, and corporate debt securities. We seek to preserve
   principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by
   applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in the
   jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate
   amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due
   to customers.

   In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an unsecured $3.0
   billion, 364 day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was
   available in up to three borrowings ("2017 Credit Agreement"). In the
   fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit
   agreement ("Amended Credit Agreement"), which provides for an unsecured
   $5.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is
   available in up to four separate borrowings. In the third quarter of
   2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured credit facility
   maturing in 2020 ("2015 Credit Agreement"). We also maintain
   uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world
   with borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million in the aggregate.

   Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement and 2015 Credit
   Agreement, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are
   exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our
   borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of borrowings
   outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at a weighted average
   interest rate of 3.34%. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, $3.0 billion
   of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the
   Amended Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
   As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were
   outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement or our uncommitted credit
   facilities.

   Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers' spending levels
   and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us.
   Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by
   customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage,
   credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce
   our customers' ability to remain current on their obligations to us and
   therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowance
   for loan and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on
   our net income.

   A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a
   material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at December 31,
   2018 and 2017.

   Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

   We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in
   foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange
   rate risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact
   business in various foreign currencies and have significant
   international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our
   international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and
   technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results
   of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are
   exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially
   from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to
   foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are
   generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit
   from a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a
   strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.

   We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program
   designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these
   exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on
   our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through
   the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign
   currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative
   instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency
   exchange contracts, please see "Note 10--Derivative Instruments" to the
   consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K.

   62
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our
   forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in
   foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do
   not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate
   movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for
   accounting purposes. The derivative's gain or loss is initially
   reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
   ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into the financial statement
   line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the
   forecasted transaction affects earnings. If we elect to discontinue our
   cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted
   transaction will occur, we continue to report them in AOCI until the
   forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point we also
   reclassify the de-designated hedges into earnings. Gains and losses on
   derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and gains
   and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash
   flow hedges are recorded in the same financial statement line item to
   which the derivative relates.

   We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and
   determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange
   rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.
   If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the
   amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange
   forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $707
   million and $536 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar
   strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount recorded
   in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts,
   before taxes, would have been approximately $707 million and $536
   million higher, respectively.

   We have an additional foreign currency exchange management program
   whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the
   foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities
   denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our
   subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments
   and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency
   exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign
   currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are
   recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains
   and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts.

   Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have
   resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of
   approximately $295 million and $243 million at December 31, 2018 and
   2017, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of
   hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of
   December 31, 2018 would have positively impacted income before income
   taxes by approximately $308 million, resulting in a net positive impact
   of approximately $13 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in
   place as of December 31, 2017 would have positively impacted income
   before income taxes by approximately $211 million, resulting in a net
   negative impact of approximately $32 million. These reasonably possible
   adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary
   assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
   functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to
   compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income
   before income taxes in the near term.

   Investment Risk

   As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our equity investments totaled $293
   million and $88 million, respectively, which represented approximately
   3% and 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio at those dates,
   respectively, and were related to minority equity interests in
   companies that are not publicly traded. As of December 31, 2018 and
   2017, we did not hold any marketable equity instruments. We review our
   investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a
   decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis
   includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales
   and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested, and other
   publicly available data.

   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

   The audited consolidated financial statements covering the years ended
   December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 and accompanying notes listed in
   Part IV, Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included

   ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

   Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
   evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the
   Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
   1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), our principal executive officer
   and our principal financial officer have concluded that as of
   December 31, 2018, the end of the period covered by this report, our
   disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

   Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our
   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
   internal control over financial reporting. Our management, including
   our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
   conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
   over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control -
   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
   Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under
   the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our
   management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
   was effective as of December 31, 2018.

   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
   of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
   independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
   report which appears in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. There were no
   changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in
   Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently
   completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
   reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
   financial reporting.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc.

   Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over
   Financial Reporting

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PayPal
   Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
   2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income,
   comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of
   the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the
   related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for
   each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 appearing
   under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated
   financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal
   control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on
   criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
   Commission (COSO).

   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
   present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
   Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its
   operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
   ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles
   generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
   opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
   internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018,
   based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
   Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

   Basis for Opinions

   The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated
   financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
   financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
   internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's
   report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under
   Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's
   consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control
   over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public
   accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
   Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
   respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
   laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
   Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
   Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
   reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
   statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
   fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
   was maintained in all material respects.

   Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing
   procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
   consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
   performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
   included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
   disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also
   included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
   estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of
   internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
   understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
   the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
   the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
   assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
   procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
   that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

   Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

   A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
   designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
   financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
   external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
   principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting
   includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
   maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
   fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
   company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
   recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
   accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
   receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
   accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
   company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
   timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
   the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
   statements.

   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
   reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
   any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
   risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
   conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
   procedures may deteriorate.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   Note 1--Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Overview and Organization

   PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our")
   was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading
   technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital
   and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide.
   PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering
   people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy. Our
   goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their
   money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any
   device. We also facilitate person-to-person payments through our
   PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products. Our combined payment solutions,
   including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and
   iZettle products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform. The terms
   "we," "our," "us," "the Company," and "PayPal" mean PayPal Holdings,
   Inc. and, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context requires,
   its subsidiaries.

   We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment
   characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the
   payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened
   as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as
   countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy,
   cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and
   regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws
   and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the
   advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through
   legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or
   changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations
   are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and
   enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material
   adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial
   condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design
   compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

   Significant Accounting Policies

   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
   financial statements of PayPal and our wholly and majority-owned
   subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
   eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where we have the
   ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the
   investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For
   such investments, our share of the investee's results of operations is
   included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements
   of income and our investment balance is included in long-term
   investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments in entities
   where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over
   the investee are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, and
   are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which
   are included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated
   statements of income and our investment balance is included in
   long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.

   In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements
   reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, which are necessary for fair presentation of the
   consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We have
   evaluated all subsequent events through the date the financial
   statements were issued. Certain amounts for prior years have been
   reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of
   and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

   Use of estimates

   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
   U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires
   management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
   amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
   and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
   and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
   period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
   related to provisions for transaction and loan losses, loss
   contingencies, income taxes, revenue recognition, and the valuation of
   goodwill and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical
   experience and various other assumptions which we believe to be
   reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from
   those estimates.

   Cash and cash equivalents

   Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments
   with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are
   composed of primarily bank deposits, government and agency securities
   and commercial paper.

   74

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   Investments

   Short-term investments include time deposits, government and agency
   securities and corporate debt securities with original maturities of
   greater than three months but less than one year when purchased.
   Government and agency securities and corporate debt securities are
   classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using
   the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are
   excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other
   comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or
   benefits.



   Long-term investments include corporate debt securities, government and
   agency securities and equity investments with maturities exceeding one
   year. Corporate debt securities and government and agency securities
   are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value
   using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses
   are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other
   comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or
   benefits.

   We elect to account for foreign currency denominated available-for-sale
   investments underlying funds receivable and customer accounts,
   short-term investments and long-term investments under the fair value
   option as further discussed in "Note 7--Funds Receivable and Customer
   Accounts" and "Note 8--Investments." The changes in fair value related
   to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are
   included in earnings as a component of other income (expense), net.

   Our equity investments consist primarily of minority equity interests
   in companies that are not publicly traded where we do not have the
   ability to exercise significant influence, or have control over the
   investee, and are reported in long-term investments on our consolidated
   balance sheets. For our equity investments that do not have a readily
   determinable fair value, we measure these equity investments at cost
   minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes resulting from
   observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or
   similar investment in the same issuer (the "Measurement Alternative").
   All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are
   recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated
   statements of income. Our investments where we have the ability to
   exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are
   accounted for as equity method investments, are reported in long-term
   investments on our consolidated balance sheets and our share of the
   investee's results of operations is included in other income (expense),
   net. The equity method investments are subject to periodic testing for
   other-than-temporary impairment.

   We assess whether an impairment loss on our Measurement Alternative
   investments and an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our debt
   securities and equity method investments has occurred due to declines
   in fair value or other market conditions. If any impairment is
   identified for Measurement Alternative investments or impairment is
   considered other than temporary for our debt securities and equity
   method investments, we write down the investment to its fair value and
   record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in
   our consolidated statements of income. With respect to our debt
   securities, this assessment takes into account the severity and
   duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the security,
   whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the
   security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we
   expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that
   is, whether a credit loss exists).

   Loans and interest receivable, held for sale

   In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer
   credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically, this
   portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any
   participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances, including
   unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible
   interest and fees. Upon approval of the decision from our Board of
   Directors to sell these receivables, the portfolio was reclassified as
   held for sale, and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value,
   determined on an aggregate basis. Following the closing of this
   transaction in July 2018, Synchrony Bank became the exclusive issuer of
   the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. We no
   longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through
   the program (other than charged off or designated to be charged off
   receivables) and thus, no longer record these receivables on our
   consolidated financial statements. PayPal earns a revenue share on the
   portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which
   includes both the sold and newly generated receivables, and it is
   recorded in revenue from other value added services on our consolidated
   financial statements. This transaction was accounted for as a true sale
   based on our determination that it met all the necessary criteria for
   such accounting, including legal isolation for transferred assets,
   ability of the transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets
   without constraint, and the transfer of control. We also concluded that
   our continuing involvement in the revenue share arrangement does not
   invalidate this determination.

   75
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   Loans and interest receivable, held for sale, represents consumer
   receivables originated under PayPal credit consumer accounts that were
   subject to the sale agreement with Synchrony Bank. Until the
   transaction with Synchrony Bank closed, we continued to work with
   independent chartered financial institutions to extend credit to U.S.
   consumers using our PayPal credit product. We purchased the related
   receivables extended by an independent chartered financial institution
   and were responsible for the related servicing functions. During the
   years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we purchased approximately $4.7
   billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, in U.S. consumer credit
   receivables.

   As part of the arrangements we had with the independent chartered
   financial institutions in the U.S., we sold back a participation
   interest in the pool of U.S. consumer receivables outstanding under
   PayPal Credit consumer accounts. For these arrangements, gains or
   losses on the sale of the participation interest were not material as
   the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximated the
   fair value at time of transfer. However, we had a separate arrangement
   with certain investors under which we sold to these investors a
   participation interest in certain U.S. consumer loans receivable that
   we purchased where the consideration received exceeded the carrying
   amount of the participation interest sold, which resulted in a gain
   reflected as net revenues in our consolidated financial statements. The
   independent chartered financial institution and other investors had no
   recourse against us related to their participation interests for
   failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by
   the chartered financial institution and other investors had the same
   priority to the interests held by us and were subject to the same
   credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this pool of
   consumer receivables. All risks of loss were shared pro rata based on
   participation interests held among all participating stakeholders. We
   applied a control-oriented, financial-components approach and accounted
   for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognized the portion of the
   participation interest for which control had been surrendered. In
   connection with its purchase of our U.S. consumer credit receivable
   portfolio, Synchrony Bank also acquired the participation interests in
   the pool of consumer receivables held by the chartered financial
   institution and other investors.

   The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly
   bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms
   also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain
   circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual
   loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these
   balances.

   Loans and interest receivable, net

   Loans and interest receivable, net represents merchant receivables
   originated under our PayPal Working Capital ("PPWC") product and PayPal
   Business Loan ("PPBL") product and consumer loans not classified as
   held for sale. In the U.S., we partner with independent chartered
   financial institutions that extend credit to the consumer (up through
   the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio to
   Synchrony Bank), or to the merchant using our PPWC product or PPBL
   product, and purchase the related receivables extended by the
   independent chartered financial institutions. During the years ended
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, we purchased approximately $3.3 billion and
   $1.5 billion, respectively, in merchant receivables.

   For our consumer credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit
   through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary. For our merchant credit
   products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances in the
   U.K. and loans in Germany through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary,
   and we extend working capital loans in Australia through an Australian
   subsidiary.

   As part of our arrangements with independent chartered financial
   institutions in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the
   pool of merchant receivables. For these arrangements, gains or losses
   on the sale of the participation interest are not material as the
   carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the
   fair value at time of transfer. The independent chartered financial
   institution has no recourse against us related to their participation
   interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation
   interests held by the chartered financial institution and other
   investors have the same priority to the interests held by us and are
   subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk
   associated with this pool of merchant receivables. All risks of loss
   are shared pro rata based on participation interests held among all
   participating stakeholders. We apply a control-oriented,
   financial-components approach and account for the asset transfer as a
   sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interest for
   which control has been surrendered.

   Loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable are reported at their
   outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold
   and pro rata allowances, including unamortized deferred origination
   costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. We maintain the
   servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant
   receivables outstanding and receive a fee approximating the fair value
   for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.

   Allowance for loans and interest receivable

   The allowance for loans and interest receivable represents management's
   estimate of incurred losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and
   receivables, net. Increases to the allowance for loans receivables are
   reflected as a component of transaction and loan losses in our
   consolidated financial statements. The evaluation process to assess the
   adequacy of allowances is subject to numerous estimates and principle
   judgments.

   For our consumer loans receivable not classified as held for sale, the
   allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance
   delinquency rates ("roll rates"). Roll rates are the percentage of
   balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency
   to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external
   factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll
   rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables
   for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the
   payment due date, in order to estimate the principal loans which have
   incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. We charge off
   consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer
   balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date.

   In connection with our agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables to Synchrony Bank and the designation of that portfolio as
   held for sale, in November 2017, we reversed the corresponding
   allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances. Such
   allowances on any newly originated U.S. consumer loans and interest
   receivables, held for sale were not established. Adjustments to the
   cost basis of this portfolio until the sale was completed, which were
   primarily driven by charge-offs, were recorded in restructuring and
   other charges in our consolidated statements of income.

   For merchant loans and advances receivable, the allowance is primarily
   based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.
   The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due,
   for principal balances related to merchant receivables outstanding is
   based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the
   loan or advance and interest or fixed fee as compared to the original
   expected repayment period.

   For our PPWC product, there is a general requirement that at least 10%
   of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must
   be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of the
   merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or
   advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12
   months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we
   recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the
   receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual
   merchant payment processing volumes. For our PPBL product, we receive
   fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan which
   generally ranges from 3 to 12 months. We actively monitor receivables
   with repayment periods greater than the original expected or
   contractual repayment period.

   The allowance for loss against interest receivable is primarily
   determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates
   to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to
   project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are
   probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is
   primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.
   Increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a
   reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statements of income.
   Increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a
   reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in
   our consolidated balance sheet.

   We charge off the receivables under our PPWC product when the
   repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the
   merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days or when the
   repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has
   made a payment within the last 60 days. We charge off the receivables
   under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past due.

   Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days for merchants and 90
   days for consumers after receipt of notification of bankruptcy.
   Consumer loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue
   interest until such time as they are charged off. Charge-offs that are
   recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and
   interest receivable.

   Customer accounts

   We hold all customer balances, both in the U.S. and internationally, as
   direct claims against us which are reflected on our consolidated
   balance sheets as a liability classified as amounts due to customers.
   Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates require us to hold eligible
   liquid assets, as defined by the regulators in these jurisdictions,
   equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer
   balances. Therefore, we restrict the use of the assets underlying the
   customer balances to meet these regulatory requirements and separately
   classify the assets as customer accounts in our consolidated balance
   sheets. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as
   current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct
   obligation under amounts due to customers.

   In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur
   Financier (the "CSSF") agreed that PayPal's management may designate up
   to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking
   subsidiary to be used to extend credit for European and U.S. credit
   activities. As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount approved by
   management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to $1.5
   billion and represented approximately 26% of European customer balances
   potentially available for corporate use by us as determined by applying
   financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. On the date PayPal's
   management designates the European customer balances held in our
   Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit, the balances
   are classified as cash and cash equivalents and no longer classified as
   customer accounts in our consolidated balance sheets. No additional
   amount has been designated for corporate usage by management during the
   year ended December 31, 2018. The remaining assets underlying the
   customer balances remain separately classified as customer accounts in
   our consolidated balance sheets. We do not commingle these customer
   accounts with corporate funds and maintain these assets separately in
   interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits,
   corporate debt securities, and foreign government and agency
   securities. See "Note 7--Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts" for
   additional information related to customer accounts.

   Accordingly, we have generally presented changes in funds receivable
   and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our
   consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the
   activity underlying our customer accounts.

   Funds receivable and funds payable

   Funds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to
   initiate collection from and clear transactions through external
   payment networks. When customers fund their PayPal account using their
   bank account or a credit card or debit card, or withdraw funds from
   their PayPal account to their bank account or through a debit card
   transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or
   settled, usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions and
   generally up to five business days for international transactions. In
   addition, a portion of our customers' funds are settled directly to
   their bank account. These funds are also classified as funds receivable
   and funds payable and arise due to the time required to initiate
   collection from and clear transactions through external payment
   networks. These funds are classified differently on our consolidated
   statement of cash flows as operating activities based on the nature of
   this activity.

   Property and equipment

   Property and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment,
   software and website development costs, land and buildings and
   leasehold improvements. Property and equipment are stated at historical
   cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are
   computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
   of the assets; generally, one to three years for computer equipment and
   software, including capitalized software and website development costs,
   three years for furniture and fixtures, up to thirty years for
   buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of five years or
   the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.

   Goodwill and intangible assets

   Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis.
   Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first
   performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more
   likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
   its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative
   assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its
   fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of
   the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the
   reporting unit is estimated using income and market approaches. The
   discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses
   expected future operating results and a market participant discount
   rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and other
   relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly
   traded entities or mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics
   to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of
   the reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes
   in the discount rate or market pricing metrics, may cause a future
   impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our
   annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2018 and 2017. We
   determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our
   reporting unit was required. As of December 31, 2018, we determined
   that no events occurred or circumstances changed from August 31, 2018
   through December 31, 2018 that would more likely than not reduce the
   fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.

   Intangible assets consist of acquired customer-related intangible
   assets, marketing related intangibles, developed technology, and other
   intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of
   estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful
   lives ranging from one to eight years. No significant residual value is
   estimated for intangible assets.

   Impairment of long-lived assets

   We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for
   impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
   the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An
   asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future
   net cash flow the asset is expected to generate.

   Allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances

   We are exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other
   payment misuse as well as nonperformance of and credit losses from
   sellers who accept payments through PayPal. We establish an allowance
   for estimated losses arising from completing customer transactions,
   such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and
   merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services,
   Automated Clearing House ("ACH") returns, buyer protection program
   claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. This allowance
   represents an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to
   provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date,
   including those which we have not yet identified. The allowance is
   monitored regularly and is updated based on actual claims data reported
   by our claims processors and other actual data received. The allowance
   is based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including
   experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment
   patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types. Additions to the
   allowance are reflected as a component of transaction and loan losses
   in our consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2018 and
   2017, the allowance for transaction losses totaled $129 million and $92
   million, respectively, and was included in accrued expenses and other
   current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

   Negative customer balances occur primarily when there are insufficient
   funds in a customer's PayPal account to cover charges applied for ACH
   returns, debit card transactions, merchant-related chargebacks due to
   nondelivery, or unsatisfactory delivery of goods or services. Negative
   customer balances can be cured by the customer by adding funds to their
   account, receiving payments, or through back-up funding sources. We
   also utilize third-party collection agents. For negative customer
   balances that are not expected to be cured or otherwise collected, we
   provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The allowance is
   estimated based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors
   including our experience with similar cases, and historical trends
   involving collection and write-off patterns. Negative customer balances
   are included in other current assets, net of the allowance in our
   consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance for negative
   customer balances are recorded as a component of transaction and loan
   loss in our consolidated statements of income. The allowance for
   negative customer balances was $215 million and $174 million at
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

   Derivative instruments

   We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant
   international revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies,
   which subjects us to foreign currency risk. We have a foreign currency
   exposure management program whereby we enter into foreign currency
   exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, generally with
   maturities of 18 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows
   primarily related to forecasted revenue denominated in certain foreign
   currencies. All outstanding derivatives are recognized in our
   consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The derivative's gain or
   loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
   comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into the
   financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in
   the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Beginning
   in 2018, we evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange
   contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the
   derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash
   flows of the hedged item and if the critical terms are the same we
   conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. Prior to and during
   2018, we evaluated the effectiveness of some of our foreign currency
   exchange contracts on a monthly basis by comparing the change in the
   fair value of the derivative instruments with the change in the fair
   value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. We do not
   exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative
   instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. If we elect to
   discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original
   forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to report them in
   accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted
   transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify the
   de-designated hedges into earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives
   held after we discontinue our cash flow hedge and gains and losses on
   derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are
   recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the
   derivative relates.

   We also hedge our economic exposure to foreign currency denominated
   monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency contracts. The
   gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts economically offset
   gains and losses on the remeasurement of certain foreign currency
   denominated monetary assets and liabilities recognized in earnings.
   Accordingly, these outstanding non-designated derivatives are
   recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and
   changes in fair value from these contracts are recorded in other income
   (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income. Our hedging
   program is not designed or operated for trading or speculative
   purposes.

   We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent
   with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items
   that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows
   associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and our
   non-designated derivatives that hedge foreign currency denominated
   monetary assets and liabilities are classified in cash flows from
   operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

   Our derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent
   counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We
   seek to mitigate such risk by limiting counterparties to, and by
   spreading the risk across major financial institutions and by entering
   into collateral security arrangements. In addition, the potential risk
   of loss with one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk
   is monitored on an ongoing basis. See "Note 10--Derivative Instruments"
   for additional information related to the derivative instruments.

   Fair value of financial instruments

   Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on
   both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2).
   Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for
   transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.
   Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available
   pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in
   less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. As of
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any assets or liabilities
   requiring measurement at fair value without observable market values
   that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value
   (Level 3).

   Concentrations of risk

   Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans and interest
   receivable, and funds receivable and customer accounts are potentially
   subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash, cash equivalents, and
   customer accounts are placed with financial institutions that
   management believes are of high credit quality. In addition, funds
   receivable are generated primarily with financial institutions which
   management believes are of high credit quality. We invest our cash,
   cash equivalents, and customer accounts primarily in highly liquid,
   highly rated instruments which are uninsured. From time to time, we may
   also have corporate deposit balances with financial services
   institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
   ("FDIC") insurance limit of $250,000. As part of our cash management
   process, we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit
   standing of these financial institutions. Our accounts receivable are
   derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S. and
   internationally. Our loans and interest receivable are derived from
   merchant and consumer financing activities for customers located in the
   U.S. and internationally. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, one
   customer accounted for 26% and 16% of net accounts receivables,
   respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of net loans
   receivable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018, one
   partner accounted for our long-term notes receivable balance, which
   represents 53% of other assets. During the years ended December 31,
   2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net
   revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we
   earned approximately 17%, 20%, and 22% of revenue from customers on
   eBay's Marketplaces platform. No other source of revenue represented
   more than 10% of our revenue.

   Revenue recognition

   See "Note 2--Revenue" for information related to our revenue
   recognition.

   Advertising expense

   We expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production
   occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the
   period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales
   and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based
   on the terms of the individual agreements, which is generally over the
   greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the
   total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on
   a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising
   expense totaled $484 million, $438 million and $350 million for the
   years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.



   Internal use software and website development costs

   Direct costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website
   development costs, including those costs incurred in expanding and
   enhancing our Payments Platform, are capitalized and amortized
   generally over an estimated useful life of one to three years and are
   recorded as depreciation and amortization. PayPal capitalized $301
   million and $309 million of internally developed software and website
   development costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,
   respectively. Amortization expense for these capitalized costs was $262
   million, $262 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31,
   2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of
   internal use software and website development costs are expensed as
   incurred.

   Defined contribution savings plans

   We have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies
   under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Our
   non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related
   to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services
   are rendered by our employees.

   Stock-based compensation

   We determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock
   units and performance based restricted stock units based on the fair
   value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine
   compensation expense associated with stock options based on the
   estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes
   valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a
   straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period
   for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly,
   stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018,
   2017 and 2016 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When
   estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of
   our employees as well as trends of actual option forfeitures.

   Foreign currency

   Many of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their
   respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and
   liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are
   translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the
   balance sheet dates. Gains and losses resulting from these translations
   are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
   Revenues, costs, and expenses of our non-U.S. subsidiaries with
   functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into
   U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses from the
   remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into the functional
   currency are recognized as other income (expense), net in our
   consolidated statements of income.

   Income taxes

   We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which
   requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current
   year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax
   consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial
   statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax
   assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the
   effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If
   necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the
   amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based
   on available evidence. We report a liability for unrecognized tax
   benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
   taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any,
   related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

   Other income (expense), net



   Other income (expense), net includes interest income which consists of
   interest earned on corporate cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts
   and short-term and long-term investments, and interest expense which
   consists of interest expenses, fees and amortization of debt discount
   on our credit agreements. Other income (expense), net also includes
   observable price changes on our equity investments recorded using the
   Measurement Alternative and foreign exchange gains and losses.

   Recent Accounting Guidance

   In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new
   accounting guidance related to accounting for leases, which will
   require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the
   balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with
   terms greater than 12 months. As we are not a lessor, other changes in
   the guidance applicable to lessors do not apply. Additionally, in 2018,
   the FASB issued codification and targeted improvements to this guidance
   effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years
   beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We
   will adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2019, using a modified
   retrospective basis and will apply the optional practical expedients
   related to the transition. We estimate an increase of approximately
   $564 million for the right of use lease assets and lease liabilities
   associated with our operating leases upon adoption. We do not believe
   the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact to our
   consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
   flows.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the measurement of credit
   losses on financial instruments. Credit losses on loans, trade and
   other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, and other
   instruments will reflect our current estimate of the expected credit
   losses and generally will result in the earlier recognition of
   allowances for losses. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt
   securities with unrealized losses will be recognized as allowances for
   credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below
   amortized cost. Additional disclosures will be required, including
   information used to track credit quality by year of origination for
   most financing receivables. The new guidance is effective for fiscal
   years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
   December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the new
   guidance effective January 1, 2020. We are required to apply the
   provisions of this guidance as a cumulative effect adjustment to
   retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in
   which the guidance is adopted with impairment of available-for-sale
   debt securities applied prospectively after adoption. We are evaluating
   the impact of and approach to adopting this new accounting guidance on
   our consolidated financial statements.

   In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that requires certain premiums on
   callable debt securities to be amortized to the earliest call date. The
   amortization period for callable debt securities purchased at a
   discount will not be impacted.  The new guidance is effective for
   fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
   after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt
   the new guidance on January 1, 2019. Transition is on a modified
   retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
   earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the
   guidance is adopted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to
   have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

   In 2018, the FASB issued new guidance in response to tax reform that
   allows the option to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the
   Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") from accumulated other
   comprehensive income to retained earnings. If such an option is
   elected, transition can be applied either retrospectively to each
   period in which the effect of tax reform is recognized or applied with
   a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning
   of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The new
   guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
   those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early
   adoption permitted. We will adopt the new guidance effective January 1,
   2019. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
   impact on our consolidated financial statements.

   In 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance to remove, modify and add
   disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This amendment is
   effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
   years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted
   for any removed or modified disclosure requirements. Transition is on a
   prospective basis for the new and modified disclosures, and on a
   retrospective basis for disclosures that have been eliminated. The
   adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on
   our consolidated financial statements.

   In 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance on the disclosure
   requirements for defined benefit pension or other post-retirement
   plans. The amended guidance removes certain disclosure requirements and
   adds others including requiring disclosure related to interest credit
   ratings and changes in benefit obligations. This amendment is effective
   for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption
   permitted, and requires retrospective adoption for all periods
   presented. We are evaluating the impact this amended disclosure
   guidance may have on the footnotes to our consolidated financial
   statements.

   In 2018, the FASB issued new accounting guidance intended to align the
   requirements for capitalization of implementation costs incurred in a
   cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the
   existing guidance for internal-use software. Capitalized implementation
   costs should be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement and
   recorded in the same financial statement line items as amounts for the
   hosting arrangement. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years,
   and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
   15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The guidance provides
   flexibility in adoption, allowing for either retrospective adjustment
   or prospective adjustment for all implementation costs incurred after
   the date of adoption. We are evaluating the impact this new accounting
   guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

   Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

   In 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue
   recognition, which was further updated in 2016 for reporting revenue on
   a gross versus net basis. This new guidance replaced all existing GAAP
   guidance on this topic and eliminated all industry-specific guidance.
   The new revenue recognition guidance provides a unified model to
   determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is
   that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
   promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
   consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
   for those goods or services. We adopted the guidance effective January
   1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis. We performed an impact analysis
   for the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2016 as well as for the
   years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. The impacts were deemed de
   minimis. No practical expedients or exemptions were elected in
   conjunction with the adoption of this new guidance. For additional
   information, see "Note 2--Revenue."

   In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the
   classification and measurement of financial instruments. This new
   guidance amends GAAP by requiring equity investments to be measured at
   fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This
   new guidance also amends the presentation of certain fair value changes
   for financial liabilities measured at fair value and it amends certain
   disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial
   instruments. Additionally, in 2018, the FASB issued technical
   corrections and improvements to this guidance effective for fiscal
   years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within
   those fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2018. We are required to
   apply the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis to all
   outstanding instruments, with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the
   date of adoption and on a prospective basis to all outstanding equity
   investments without a readily determinable fair value. We adopted the
   guidance, including early adoption of the technical corrections and
   improvements, effective January 1, 2018. Beginning in the first quarter
   of 2018, we applied the Measurement Alternative to substantially all
   our equity investments, which required us to measure these equity
   investments at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes
   resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an
   identical or similar investment in the same issuer. For additional
   information on the impact the adoption of this guidance had on our
   consolidated financial statements during the year ended December 31,
   2018, please refer to "Note 8--Investments."

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on classifying certain cash
   receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The new
   guidance addresses the classification of cash flows related to: debt
   prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt
   instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that
   are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the
   borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business
   combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds
   from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance, including
   bank-owned life insurance, distributions received from equity method
   investees, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The
   guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be
   applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than
   one class of cash flows. The guidance should be applied retrospectively
   after adoption. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018. The
   adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our
   consolidated financial statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on restricted cash on the
   statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires the classification
   and presentation of changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents in
   the statement of cash flows. Therefore, amounts generally described
   as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included
   with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and
   ending balances shown on the statement of cash flows. The guidance had
   to be applied retrospectively after adoption. We adopted the guidance
   effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. The beginning and
   ending balances of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated
   statement of cash flows now include restricted cash and restricted cash
   equivalents, such as cash and cash equivalents underlying customer
   accounts and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents within
   short-term investments.

   In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the scope and
   application of the de-recognition of non-financial assets and the sale
   or transfer of non-financial assets, including partial sales. We
   adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective
   basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on
   our consolidated financial statements.

   In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying which changes to the
   terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to
   apply modification accounting. Specifically, an entity would apply
   modification accounting only if the fair value, vesting conditions, or
   classification of the awards changes as a result of changes in the
   terms or conditions. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018
   and applied it prospectively upon adoption. The adoption of this
   guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
   statements.

   In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance intended to better align the
   results of hedge accounting with an entity's risk management
   activities. This guidance updates the designation and measurement
   guidance for qualifying hedging relationships by expanding hedge
   accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and by
   refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity's
   hedging strategies. The amendments also align the recognition and
   presentation of the effects of the hedge results in the financial
   statements to increase the understandability of the results of an
   entity's intended hedging strategies. Additionally, the guidance
   includes certain targeted improvements to ease the operational burden
   of applying hedge accounting. We are required to apply the guidance
   with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
   beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is adopted and
   prospectively apply the presentation and disclosure guidance. We early
   adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using a modified
   retrospective approach to reflect application of the new guidance
   effective January 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a
   material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

   In 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to provide clarity around
   application of income tax accounting in situations where the assessment
   of tax implications of the Tax Act might not be complete as of period
   end in which the Tax Act was enacted. This guidance prescribes that an
   entity must reflect the income tax impact of the Tax Act in the period
   in which the tax accounting is complete and allows an entity to report
   provisional amounts for those specific effects of the Tax Act for which
   the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be
   determined. No provisional amounts should be reported for specific
   effects of the Tax Act for which a reasonable estimate cannot be
   determined, and the entity should continue to apply the provisions of
   the tax laws that were in effect prior to the enactment of the Tax Act.
   It further allows a measurement period of one year from the date of
   enactment within which to complete the accounting for all impacts of
   the Tax Act. Our consolidated financial statements reflect tax
   accounting in compliance with this guidance.

   In 2018, the FASB amended existing guidance to include share-based
   payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from
   non-employees. This amendment prescribes that entities should apply the
   requirements for employee share-based payment compensation to
   non-employee awards used to acquire goods and services, except for
   specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the
   attribution of cost (period of time that the awards vest and pattern of
   recognition). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and
   interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
   2018, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the guidance effective
   April 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
   impact on our consolidated financial statements.

   Note 2--Revenue

   PayPal enables its customers to send and receive payments. We earn
   revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers
   on our Payments Platforms and from other value added services. Our
   revenues are classified into two categories, transaction revenues and
   revenues from other value added services.

   Transaction Revenues

   We earn transaction revenues primarily from fees charged to merchants
   and consumers on a transaction basis. These fees may have a fixed and
   variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of
   the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the
   transaction is processed. If the underlying transaction is approved for
   refund, we reimburse the variable component of the fee. We estimate the
   amount of fee refunds that will be processed during the quarter and
   record a provision against our net revenues. The volume of activity
   processed on our Payments Platform, which results in transaction
   revenue, is referred to as Total Payments Volume ("TPV"). We define TPV
   as the value of payments, net of reversals, successfully completed on
   our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment
   solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. We earn
   additional fees on transactions where we perform a currency conversion
   and when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where
   the merchant and consumer are in different countries).

   Our contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be
   terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the
   notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the
   transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already
   provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without
   significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered
   pricing, based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is
   adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is
   different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that
   this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future
   material right since the discount is within a range typically offered
   to class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any
   capitalized contract costs, and do not carry any material contract
   balances.

   Our service comprises a single performance obligation to complete
   payments on our Payments Platform for our customers. Using our risk
   assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on
   individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be
   authorized for completion on our Payment Platform. When we authorize a
   transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the
   payment transaction.

   We recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis
   as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of
   completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we
   control the service of completing payments on our Payments Platform. We
   bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service,
   contract directly with our customers, control the product
   specifications, and define the value proposal from our services.
   Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our
   customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances
   where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions
   to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk
   when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment
   processors and other financial institutions are recognized as
   transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer
   support.

   We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most
   transactions completed on our Payments Platforms, except for
   transactions using our gateway products or where our customer
   agreements specifically do not provide for protections. These programs
   protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud
   and counterparty performance. Our buyer protection program provides
   protection to consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the
   consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does
   not arrive or does not match the seller's description. Our seller
   protection programs provide protection to merchants against claims that
   a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item
   was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the
   payment on eligible sales. These protection programs do not provide a
   separate service to our customers and we estimate and record associated
   costs in transaction and loan losses during the period the payment
   transaction is completed.

   Revenues from Other Value Added Services

   We earn revenues from other value added services which is comprised
   primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, subscription fees,
   gateway fees, and other services that we provide to our merchants and
   consumers. These contracts typically have one performance obligation
   which is provided and recognized over the term of the contract. The
   transaction price is generally fixed and known at the end of each
   reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to
   estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. In our
   partnership agreement with Synchrony Bank, in addition to the revenue
   share we earn, we also recognize revenue for transition servicing
   activities performed on their behalf using a relative selling price
   determined through the adjusted market assessment approach. We record
   revenue earned in revenues from other value added services on a net
   basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing
   transactions.

   We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our
   credit portfolio of loans receivable, gain on sale of participation
   interest in certain loans and advances, and interest earned on certain
   PayPal customer account balances. Interest and fees earned on the
   credit portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based
   on the effective interest method and are presented net of any required
   reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.

   Disaggregation of Revenue

   We determine operating segments based on how our Chief Operating
   Decision Maker ("CODM") manages the business, makes operating decisions
   around the allocation of resources and evaluates operating performance.
   Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews our operating
   results on a consolidated basis. We operate in one segment and have one
   reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed
   by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and
   uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by
   economic factors is most appropriately depicted through our primary
   geographical markets and type of revenue (transaction and other value
   added services) categories. Revenues recorded within these categories
   are earned from similar services for which the nature of associated
   fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially the
   same.

   The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by primary
   geographical markets and revenues by major products and services:

   balances of $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion for the years
   ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which do not
   represent revenues recognized in the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue
   from contracts with customers.

   Net revenues are attributed to the U.S., the U.K., and other countries
   primarily based upon the country in which the merchant is located, or
   in the case of a cross-border transaction, may be earned from the
   country in which the consumer and the merchant respectively reside. Net
   revenues earned from other value added services are typically
   attributed to the country in which either the customer or partner
   reside.

   Note 3--Net Income Per Share

   Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the
   period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
   during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
   net income for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
   common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the
   period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
   basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31,
   2018, 2017, and 2016 was based on the weighted average number of common
   shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding
   options and equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income
   per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation
   of diluted net income per share excludes all anti-dilutive common
   shares.

   The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net
   income per share for the periods indicated:

   Acquisitions Completed in 2018

   During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed four acquisitions
   reflecting 100% of the equity interests of the acquired companies, for
   an aggregate purchase price of $2.7 billion.

   Hyperwallet

   We completed the acquisition of HWLT Holdings Inc. ("Hyperwallet") in
   November 2018 by acquiring all the outstanding shares for a total
   purchase price of approximately $399 million, consisting of cash
   consideration. We acquired Hyperwallet to enhance our payout
   capabilities and improve our ability to provide an integrated suite of
   payment solutions to ecommerce platforms and marketplaces around the
   world. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in
   approximately $100 million of customer-related intangible assets,
   approximately $30 million of developed technology intangible assets,
   and approximately $2 million of marketing related intangible assets
   with estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years, funds receivable
   and customer accounts of $412 million, funds payable and amounts due to
   customers of $412 million, net liabilities of approximately $32
   million, and initial goodwill of approximately $299 million, which is
   attributable to the workforce of Hyperwallet and the synergies expected
   to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect goodwill to be
   deductible for income tax purposes. The allocation of the purchase
   price for this acquisition has been prepared on a preliminary basis and
   changes to the allocation to certain assets, liabilities, and tax
   estimates may occur as additional information becomes available.

   iZettle

   We completed the acquisition of iZettle AB (publ) ("iZettle") in
   September 2018 by acquiring all the outstanding shares for a total
   purchase price of $2.2 billion, consisting of cash consideration paid
   of approximately $2.1 billion (net of cash acquired of $103 million)
   and restricted shares of PayPal with a fair value of approximately $22
   million. We acquired iZettle to expand our in-store presence and
   strengthen our Payments Platform to help small businesses around the
   world grow and thrive in an omnichannel retail environment.

   The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
   purchase consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and
   liabilities assumed:

   The intangible assets acquired consists primarily of merchant
   relationships, trade name/trademarks, developed technology, and
   existing acquirer relationships with estimated useful lives ranging
   from 3 to 7 years. The excess of the purchase consideration over the
   fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
   was recorded as goodwill, which is attributable to the workforce of
   iZettle and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. We do
   not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes. The
   allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition has been prepared
   on a preliminary basis and changes to the allocation to certain assets,
   liabilities, and tax estimates may occur as additional information
   becomes available.

   Simility

   We completed the acquisition of Simility, Inc. ("Simility") in July
   2018 by acquiring all the outstanding shares for a total purchase price
   of $107 million, consisting of cash consideration. We acquired Simility
   to enhance our ability to deliver fraud prevention and risk management
   solutions to merchants globally. The allocation of purchase
   consideration resulted in approximately $18 million of developed
   technology intangible assets with an estimated useful life of 3 years,
   net assets of approximately $10 million, and initial goodwill of
   approximately $79 million, which is attributable to the workforce of
   Simility and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. We
   do not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes. The
   allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition has been prepared
   on a preliminary basis and changes to the allocation to certain assets,
   liabilities, and tax estimates may occur as additional information
   becomes available.

   Other Acquisitions

   In May 2018, we completed an acquisition which was accounted for as a
   business combination. The total purchase price for this acquisition was
   $16 million, consisting of cash consideration. The allocation of
   purchase consideration resulted in approximately $13 million of
   developed technology intangible assets with an estimated useful life of
   2 years and initial goodwill of approximately $3 million, which is
   attributable to the workforce of the acquired company and the synergies
   expected to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect goodwill to be
   deductible for income tax purposes. The allocation of the purchase
   price for this acquisition has been prepared on a preliminary basis and
   changes to the allocation to certain assets, liabilities, and tax
   estimates may occur as additional information becomes available.

   We have included the financial results of the acquired businesses in
   our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
   Revenues and expenses related to these acquisitions for the year ended
   December 31, 2018 were not material. Pro forma results of operations
   have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were
   not material to our financial results.

   Acquisitions Completed in 2017

   During 2017, we completed two acquisitions, reflecting 100% of the
   equity interests of the acquired companies, for an aggregate purchase
   price of $420 million:

   TIO Networks Corp.

   We completed the acquisition of TIO Networks Corp. ("TIO") in July 2017
   by acquiring all the outstanding shares of TIO for $2.64 per share in
   cash. We acquired TIO to expand our scale of operations, complement our
   product portfolio, and to help accelerate our entry into bill payments.
   The total purchase price of $238 million consisted of cash
   consideration. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in
   approximately $66 million of technology and customer-related intangible
   assets with an estimated useful life of 1 to 5 years, net assets of
   approximately $6 million and goodwill of approximately $166 million,
   which is attributable to the workforce of TIO and the synergies
   expected to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect that all of
   the goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes.

   In November 2017, we suspended the operations of TIO to protect
   customer data as part of an ongoing investigation of security
   vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. In March 2018, our management
   decided to wind down TIO's operations. Refer to Note 5--"Goodwill and
   Intangible Assets" and Note 13--"Commitments and
   Contingencies--Litigation and Regulatory Matters" for further details.

   Swift Financial Corporation

   We completed the acquisition of Swift Financial Corporation ("Swift")
   in September 2017 by acquiring all the outstanding shares of Swift for
   a total purchase price of $182 million. We acquired Swift to enable us
   to enhance our underwriting capabilities and strengthen our business
   financing offerings, helping us to deepen relationships with our
   existing merchants and expand services to new merchants. The allocation
   of purchase consideration resulted in approximately $44 million of
   technology and customer-related intangible assets with an estimated
   useful life of 1 to 3 years, $169 million of merchant receivables, net
   liabilities of approximately $129 million and goodwill of approximately
   $98 million, which is attributable to the workforce of Swift and the
   synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect
   goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes. The gross
   contractual merchant receivables acquired were approximately $213
   million. Management estimates that the cash collected will approximate
   the contractual amounts of merchant receivables.

   Acquisitions Completed in 2016

   There were no acquisitions or divestitures completed in 2016.

   Note 5--Goodwill and Intangible Assets

   The goodwill acquired during 2018 was associated with the four
   acquisitions we completed in 2018. The adjustments to goodwill during
   2018 pertain to foreign currency translation adjustments and
   measurement period adjustments related to our acquisitions of Swift and
   TIO completed in the third quarter of 2017. The goodwill acquired
   during 2017 was due primarily to the two acquisitions that we completed
   in 2017. The adjustments to goodwill during 2017 related to foreign
   currency translation adjustments.

   All identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization and no

   Amortization expense for intangible assets was $149 million, $126
   million and $150 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017,
   and 2016, respectively. We test intangible assets for recoverability
   when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
   asset group may not be recoverable.

   As a result of the suspension of TIO's operations announced in November
   2017, we performed a test for recoverability of the customer-related
   intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of TIO in
   July 2017. The test involved comparing the intangible assets' carrying
   values to their future net undiscounted cash flows that we expected
   would be generated by the intangible assets. Based on the results of
   this test, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $30
   million in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement
   of income for 2017, which was measured as the excess of carrying value
   over the estimated fair value of the assets. The calculation of the
   estimated fair value of these customer-related intangible assets is
   based on the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow
   methodology. Following recognition of the impairment charge, we are
   amortizing the adjusted carrying amount of those assets over their
   remaining useful life. We also determined that the suspension of TIO's
   operations did not indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit
   to which the TIO goodwill was assigned would be below its carrying
   amount.

   Expected future intangible asset amortization as of December 31, 2018
   is as follows:

   We elect to account for certain investments within customer accounts,
   including foreign-currency denominated available-for-sale investments,
   under the fair value option. As a result, any gains and losses from
   fair value changes on such investments are recognized in other income
   (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income. Election of
   the fair value option allows us to significantly reduce the accounting
   asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the changes in
   the fair value of available-for-sale investments and the corresponding
   foreign exchange gains and losses relating to customer liabilities. At
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, the estimated fair value of our investments
   included within funds receivable and customer accounts under the fair
   value option was $2.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. In the
   years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $117 million of net losses and
   $176 million of net gains from fair value changes, respectively, were
   recognized in other income (expense), net on the consolidated
   statements of income.

   The aggregate fair value of investments classified as
   available-for-sale included within funds receivable and customer
   accounts in an unrealized loss position was $3.1 billion and $6.0
   billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no material investments that had
   been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than 12
   months. The aggregate gross unrealized loss on our short-term and
   long-term investments was not material as of December 31, 2018 and
   2017. We believe the decline in value is due to temporary market
   conditions and expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
   securities. We neither intend nor anticipate the need to sell the
   securities before recovery. We will continue to monitor the performance
   of the investment portfolio and assess market and interest rate risk
   when evaluating whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. Amounts
   reclassified to earnings from unrealized gains and losses were not
   material for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

   The estimated fair values of our investments classified as
   available-for-sale included within funds receivable and customer
   accounts by date of contractual maturity were as follows:

   We elected to account for foreign denominated available-for-sale
   investments held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary under the fair
   value option. Election of the fair value option allows us to recognize
   any gains and losses from fair value changes on such investments in
   other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income to
   offset certain foreign exchange gains and losses on our foreign
   denominated customer liabilities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the
   estimated fair value of our investments included within short-term
   investments and long-term investments under the fair value option was
   $305 million and $277 million, respectively. In the years ended
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, $15 million of net losses and $36 million
   of net gains, respectively, from fair value changes were recognized in
   other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.

   The aggregate fair value of short-term and long-term investments
   classified as available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position was
   $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $2.8 billion as of
   December 31, 2017, of which $895 million and $207 million,
   respectively, was in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater
   than 12 months. The aggregate gross unrealized loss on our short-term
   and long-term investments was not material as of December 31, 2018 and
   2017. We believe the decline in value is due to temporary market
   conditions and expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
   securities.  We neither intend nor anticipate the need to sell the
   securities before recovery. We will continue to monitor the performance
   of the investment portfolio and assess market and interest rate risk
   when evaluating whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. Amounts
   reclassified to earnings from unrealized gains and losses were not
   material for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

   Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on
   less active markets (Level 2). Level 2 instrument valuations are
   obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable
   instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models
   using market observable inputs.

   Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments
   with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are
   comprised primarily of bank deposits, government and agency securities,
   and commercial paper.

   We elect to account for foreign currency denominated available-for-sale
   investments underlying funds receivable and customer accounts,
   short-term investments, and long-term investments under the fair value
   option as further discussed in "Note 7--Funds Receivable and Customer
   Accounts" and "Note 8--Investments."

   A majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing
   models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple
   inputs where applicable, such as currency rates, interest rate yield
   curves, option volatility, and equity prices. Our derivative
   instruments are primarily short-term in nature, generally one month to
   one year in duration. Certain foreign currency contracts designated as
   cash flow hedges may have a duration of up to 18 months.

   We did not have any transfers of financial instruments between
   valuation levels during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As
   of December 31, 2018, we did not have any assets or liabilities
   requiring measurement at fair value without observable market values
   that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value
   (Level 3).

   We measured these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any,
   plus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly
   transactions for an identical or a similar investment in the same
   issuer.

   None of our financial assets and liabilities were measured at fair
   value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2017.

   Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured and Recorded at Fair
   Value

   Our financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time
   deposits, loans and interest receivable, net, loans and interest
   receivable, held for sale, certain customer accounts, notes receivable,
   and notes payable are carried at amortized cost, which approximates
   their fair value. If these financial instruments were measured at fair
   value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1;
   restricted cash, time deposits, loans and interest receivable, held for
   sale, certain customer accounts and notes payable would be classified
   as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified
   as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

   Note 10--Derivative Instruments

   Summary of Derivative Instruments

   Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the
   volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in
   foreign currency exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit
   risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the
   terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our
   counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial
   institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In
   addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty
   resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing
   basis.

   Foreign Exchange Contracts

   We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant
   international revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies,
   which subjects us to foreign currency risk. We have a foreign currency
   exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign
   currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 18 months or
   less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to
   forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of
   the foreign exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the
   U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in
   the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These
   derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and
   accordingly, the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a
   component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
   subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the
   forecasted transaction affects earnings. Beginning in 2018, we evaluate
   the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange contracts on a
   quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative
   instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the
   hedged item; if the critical terms are the same we conclude the hedge
   will be perfectly effective. Prior to and during 2018, we evaluated the
   effectiveness of some of our foreign exchange contracts on a monthly
   basis by comparing the change in the fair value of the derivative
   instruments with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash
   flows of the hedged item. We did not exclude any component of the
   changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment
   of hedge effectiveness. We do not use any foreign exchange contracts
   for trading or speculative purposes.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that $171 million of net
   derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in
   accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into
   earnings within the next 12 months. During the years ended December 31,
   2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges
   because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would
   not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to
   earnings prior to the occurrence of the hedged transaction. If we elect
   to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the
   original forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to report them
   in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted
   transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify the
   de-designated hedges into earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives
   held after we discontinue our cash flow hedge and gains and losses on
   derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are
   recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the
   derivative relates.

   We have an additional foreign currency exposure management program
   whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign
   exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
   other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts
   are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not
   entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on
   our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on
   our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net,
   which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange
   contracts.

   Fair Value of Derivative Contracts

   The fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments as of
   December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

   Master Netting Agreements - Rights of Setoff

   Under master netting agreements with respective counterparties to our
   foreign exchange contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we are
   allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net
   amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have elected to
   present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross
   basis in our consolidated balance sheets. Rights of setoff associated
   with our foreign exchange contracts represented a potential offset to
   both assets and liabilities by $45 million as of December 31, 2018 and
   $56 million as of December 31, 2017. During the years ended
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, we entered into collateral security
   arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when
   the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from
   contractually established thresholds. We posted no collateral related
   to our derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and $38 million
   of collateral related to our derivative liabilities as of December 31,
   2017, which is recognized in other current assets on our consolidated
   balance sheets, and is related to the right to reclaim cash collateral.
   We received $195 million in counterparty cash collateral related to our
   derivative assets as of December 31, 2018, which is recognized in other
   current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and is related
   to the obligation to return cash collateral. Additionally, as of
   December 31, 2018, we received $6 million in counterparty non-cash
   collateral in the form of debt securities. We did not receive any
   counterparty cash or non-cash collateral related to our derivative
   assets as of December 31, 2017.

   Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount;
   however, this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not,
   when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of

   Note 11--Loans and Interest Receivable

   We offer credit products to consumers and certain small and
   medium-sized merchants. We work with independent chartered financial
   institutions that extend credit to the consumer or merchant using our
   credit products in the U.S. For our consumer credit products outside
   the U.S., we extend credit through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary.
   For our merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend working
   capital advances in the U.K. and loans in Germany through our
   Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and we extend working capital loans in
   Australia through an Australian subsidiary. Prior to July 2018, we
   purchased receivables related to credit extended to U.S. consumers by
   independent chartered financial institutions and were responsible for
   servicing functions related to that portfolio. Following the completion
   of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to
   Synchrony Bank in July 2018, we no longer purchase receivables related
   to the U.S. consumer loans, but remain responsible for the servicing
   functions related to the sold portfolio through a transition period. We
   purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by an
   independent chartered financial institution and are responsible for
   servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the year ended
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, we purchased approximately $8.1 billion and
   $10.2 billion in credit receivables, respectively.

   Loans and Interest Receivable, Held for Sale

   As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding balance of loans and
   interest receivable, held for sale as compared to $6.4 billion as of
   December 31, 2017. In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell
   our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank.
   Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal
   balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro rata
   allowances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and
   estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval of our Board of
   Directors to sell these receivables, the portfolio was reclassified as
   held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value,
   determined on an aggregate basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017,
   due to the designation as held for sale, the associated allowance for
   this portfolio was reversed, resulting in an increase of approximately
   $39 million in revenue from other value added services and a decrease
   of approximately $283 million in transaction and loan losses in our
   consolidated statements of income. See "Note 1--Overview and Summary of
   Significant Accounting Policies" for additional information. In July
   2018, we completed the sale of this portfolio to Synchrony Bank,
   approximately at par, for total consideration of $6.9 billion, which
   includes cash consideration of $6.5 billion and a long-term note
   receivable in the amount of $426 million, which was recorded at its
   present value at the time of the completion of the sale in the amount
   of $261 million in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
   This amount will be subject to accretion over the term of the
   arrangement, and is not reflected as a cash item on our consolidated
   statements of cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2018,
   additional expenses incurred due to this transaction resulted in a net
   loss of approximately $40 million recorded in restructuring and other
   expenses on our consolidated statements of income. The purchase price
   is subject to post-closing true-up and certain other adjustments under
   the terms of the purchase agreement. PayPal also earns a revenue share
   on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which
   includes both the sold and newly generated receivables. The transaction
   was accounted for as a true sale based on our determination that it met
   all the necessary criteria for such accounting, including legal
   isolation for transferred assets, ability of the transferee to pledge
   or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and the transfer
   of control. We also concluded that our continuing involvement in the
   revenue share arrangement does not invalidate this determination.

   Loans and Interest Receivable, Net

   Consumer Receivables

   We offer credit products to consumers who choose PayPal Credit at
   checkout. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance of
   consumer receivables primarily consisted of loans and interest
   receivable due from international consumer accounts and was $704
   million and $326 million, respectively.

   We closely monitor credit quality for our consumer receivables to
   manage and evaluate our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk
   management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to
   full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we
   use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using
   detailed information from external sources such as credit bureaus where
   available and internal historical experience including the consumer's
   prior repayment history with PayPal Credit products as well as other
   measures. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new
   and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our
   collection practices and strategies and in our determination of our
   allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.

   The following tables present the delinquency status of the principal
   amount of consumer loans and interest receivable. The amounts shown
   below are based on the number of days past the billing date to the
   consumer. Current represents balances that are within 30 days of the
   billing date. Amounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 represent loans
   and interest receivable due from consumer accounts, of which
   approximately 94.9% and 96.0%, respectively, were current.

   We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a
   customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date. Bankrupt
   accounts are charged off within 90 days after receipt of notification
   of bankruptcy. Loans receivable past the payment due date continue to
   accrue interest until they are charged off. We record an allowance for
   loss against the interest and fees receivable.

   respectively, and allowances of $12 million and $7 million at
   December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

   The provision for loan losses relating to our consumer loans receivable
   portfolio is recognized in transaction and loan losses. The provision
   for interest receivable due to interest and fees earned on our consumer
   loans receivable portfolio is recognized in net revenues from other
   value added services as a reduction in revenue. Charge-offs that are
   recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and
   interest receivable.

   Merchant receivables

   We offer business financing solutions to certain small and medium-sized
   merchants through our PayPal Working Capital ("PPWC") and PayPal
   Business Loan ("PPBL") products. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the
   total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and
   interest and fees receivable was $1.9 billion and $1.0 billion,
   respectively, net of the participation interest sold to an independent
   chartered financial institution of $84 million and $28 million,
   respectively. See "Note 1--Overview and Summary of Significant
   Accounting Policies" for additional information on this participation
   arrangement.

   Through our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of
   their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed
   fee for the loan or advance, which targets an annual percentage rate
   based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and
   advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant's future
   payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we
   provide merchants with access to short-term business financing for a
   fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well
   as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected by periodic
   payments until the balance has been satisfied.

   The interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is
   extended and recognized as deferred revenues included in other current
   liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or
   fee is amortized to net revenues from other value added services based
   on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the
   repayment period based on the merchant's payment processing history
   with PayPal, where available. For PPWC, there is a general requirement
   that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus
   the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment
   rate of the merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the
   loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9
   to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis,
   we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on
   the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on
   actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed
   periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan which generally
   ranges from 3 to 12 months. We actively monitor receivables with
   repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual
   repayment period.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   We closely monitor credit quality for our merchant loans and advances
   that we extend or purchase, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and
   manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a
   business financing loan or advance, we use, among other indicators,
   risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained
   from multiple data sources, both external and internal data to predict
   the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of
   the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary
   drivers of the models include the merchant's annual payment volume,
   payment processing history with PayPal and prior repayment history with
   the PayPal products where available, elements sourced from consumer
   credit bureau and business credit bureau reports, and other information
   obtained during the application process. We use delinquency status and
   trends to assist in making ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our
   internal models, to plan our collection practices and strategies, and
   in our determination of our allowance for these loans and advances.

   For merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency, from
   current to 180 days past due, is based on the current expected or
   contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest
   or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual
   repayment period. We charge off receivables outstanding under our PPBL
   product when the repayments are 180 days past due. We charge off the
   receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are
   180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not
   made a payment in the last 60 days or when the repayments are 360 days
   past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment within
   the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of
   receiving notification of bankruptcy. The provision for loan losses is
   recognized in transaction and loan losses, and the provisions for
   interest and fees receivable is recognized in deferred revenues
   included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance
   sheets. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to
   our allowance for loans and interest receivable.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   Note 12--Notes Payable

   Amended Credit Agreement

   In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement
   ("2017 Credit Agreement") that provided for an unsecured $3.0 billion,
   364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was available in
   up to three borrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into
   an amended credit agreement ("Amended Credit Agreement") which amends
   and restates in its entirety the existing 2017 Credit Agreement. The
   Amended Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion,
   364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in
   up to four separate borrowings. Borrowings and other amounts payable
   under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PayPal, Inc.
   Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our
   subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Amended Credit Agreement
   provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other
   obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Amended Credit
   Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, no subsidiaries were designated as
   additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement
   may be used to repurchase equity securities from shareholders, to repay
   intercompany debt, and for other general corporate purposes of the
   Company and our subsidiaries.

   Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at either
   (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin (based on
   our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent or
   (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the New York
   Federal Reserve Bank rate (the greater of the federal funds effective
   rate and the overnight bank funding rate), or LIBOR plus a margin
   (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.25
   percent. The Amended Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts
   owed thereunder will be due and payable in November 2019, unless the
   commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an
   event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case
   of certain bankruptcy-related events). Subject to certain exceptions,
   if we were to issue debt securities or enter into a credit facility, a
   corresponding portion of the aggregate commitments and outstanding
   loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will be terminated and be
   required to be paid, as applicable. The Amended Credit Agreement
   contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and
   negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default,
   and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative
   covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens,
   subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to
   meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated
   interest coverage ratio, which will be applicable under certain
   conditions based on our public debt ratings, and a maximum consolidated
   leverage ratio.

   In the first quarter of 2018, we effected two drawdowns aggregating to
   $2.0 billion under the 2017 Credit Agreement, which were in addition to
   the outstanding balance of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. In the
   second quarter of 2018, we repaid $1.0 billion of the borrowings
   outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The borrowings outstanding
   as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus
   a margin of 1.125% resulting in a weighted average interest rate of
   3.34% and 2.78%, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion
   was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. The total interest
   expense and fees we recorded related to the Amended Credit Agreement
   was $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31,
   2018, $3.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes
   permitted by the Amended Credit Agreement, subject to customary
   conditions to borrowing.

   2015 Credit Agreement

   In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement ("2015
   Credit Agreement") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion,
   five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter
   of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with
   available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the
   amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding
   from time to time. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the 2015
   Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. We may,
   subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the
   commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million.
   Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our
   subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2015 Credit Agreement
   provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other
   obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2015 Credit Agreement.
   As of December 31, 2018, no subsidiaries were designated as additional
   borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement may be used
   for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
   general corporate purposes.

   Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either
   (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from
   1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent
   bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, or LIBOR plus a
   margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to
   0.625 percent. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or
   more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2015 Credit
   Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings
   and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2015 Credit
   Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts
   owed thereunder will be due and payable on July 17, 2020, unless
   (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or,
   if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the
   case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is
   extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The
   2015 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties,
   affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants,
   events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the
   banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the
   incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial
   covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to
   a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, which will be
   applicable under certain conditions based on our public debt ratings,
   and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.

   During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the
   2015 Credit Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of
   2017. The borrowing bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus a margin of
   1.125% resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 2.36%. As of
   December 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding
   under the 2015 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018,
   $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes
   permitted by the 2015 Credit Agreement subject to customary conditions
   to borrowing.

   Other Available Facilities

   We maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout
   the world, with borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million in the
   aggregate. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and
   reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit
   ratings. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under
   those facilities, and therefore, approximately $300 million of
   borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to
   borrowing.

   Note 13--Commitments and Contingencies

   Commitments

   As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.8 billion of unused credit
   was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $26.4
   billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2017. While this amount
   represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced,
   and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit account holders will
   access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In
   addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused
   credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on, among
   other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. The decrease
   in unused credit in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to the sale of our
   U.S. consumer credit portfolio.

   Prior to the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables portfolio in July 2018, when a consumer funded a purchase
   in the U.S. using a PayPal Credit product issued by a chartered
   financial institution, the chartered financial institution extended
   credit to the consumer, funded the extension of credit at the point of
   sale and advanced funds to the merchant. We purchased the receivables
   related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial
   institution and, as a result of such purchase, bore the risk of loss in
   the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial
   institution continued to own each customer account, we owned the
   related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and were
   responsible for all servicing functions related to the account.
   Subsequent to the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit
   receivables portfolio, we no longer purchase the receivables related to
   consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution. See
   "Note 1--Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for
   additional information.

   Lease Arrangements

   We have lease obligations under certain non-cancelable operating
   leases. Our non-cancelable operating lease agreements typically have
   terms between 3-10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal
   options. We recognize rent expense under such agreements on a
   straight-line basis.

   Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases at
   December 31, 2018, are as follows:

   Litigation and Regulatory Matters

   Overview

   We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing
   basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an
   indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from
   such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
   estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of
   estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the
   range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none
   of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other
   amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in
   which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable,
   we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range
   of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably
   possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding
   (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are
   not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible
   loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have
   disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal
   proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary
   damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary
   remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may
   require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have
   a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters
   disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss
   or range of losses that could potentially result from the application
   of such non-monetary remedies.

   Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we
   believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended
   December 31, 2018. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings
   described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently
   available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly
   from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in
   judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not
   material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently
   unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more
   matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in
   excess of management's expectations, the impact on our operating
   results or financial condition for that reporting period could be
   material.

   Regulatory Proceedings

   We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions
   administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign
   Assets Control ("OFAC"). We have self-reported to OFAC certain
   transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently
   identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade
   sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding
   possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices
   between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time
   transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported
   additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received
   new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of
   these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in
   claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage
   awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business
   practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require
   significant management time, result in the diversion of significant
   operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.



   On March 28, 2016, we received a Civil Investigative Demand ("CID")
   from the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") as part of its investigation
   to determine whether we, through our Venmo service, have been or are
   engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in violation of the Federal
   Trade Commission Act. The CID requested the production of documents and
   answers to written questions related to our Venmo service. We have
   cooperated with the FTC in connection with the CID. On February 27,
   2018, we entered into a Consent Order with the FTC in which we settled
   potential allegations arising from our Venmo services between 2013 and
   2017. The Consent Order does not contain a monetary penalty, but
   requires PayPal to make various changes to Venmo's disclosures and
   business practices. The FTC approved the final Consent Order on May 24,
   2018. As required by the Consent Order, we are cooperating with the
   FTC's requirements and working to ensure compliance with the Consent
   Order. Any failure to comply with the Consent Order may increase the
   possibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation,
   additional regulatory actions, injunctions, or monetary penalties, or
   require further changes to our business practices, significant
   management time, or the diversion of significant operational resources,
   all of which could result in a material loss or otherwise harm our
   business.

   Legal Proceedings

   On January 12, 2017, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned
   Silverman v. Schulman, et al., Case No. 5:17-cv-00162 (the "California
   Derivative Case") was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
   District of California (the "Court"). On March 24, 2017, a second
   derivative action substantially similar to the California Derivative
   Case captioned Seeman v. Schulman, et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-00318-UNA,
   was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the
   "Delaware Derivative Case"). On April 19, 2017, the Delaware court in
   the Delaware Derivative Case issued an order adopting a stipulation
   filed by the parties transferring the Delaware Derivative Case to the
   Court so that the Delaware Derivative Case could be consolidated with
   the pending California Derivative Case. On April 27 and 28, 2017, two
   additional shareholder derivative lawsuits substantially similar to the
   California Derivative Case and Delaware Derivative Case were filed in
   the Court. These cases are captioned Sims v. Schulman, et al., Case No.
   1:17-cv-02428, and Liss v. Schulman, et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-02446-NC
   (together with the California Derivative Case and the Delaware
   Derivative Case, the "Derivative Cases"). The Derivative Cases are
   purportedly brought on behalf of the Company and assert claims relating
   to our disclosure in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
   quarterly period ended March 31, 2016, that on March 28, 2016, we
   received a CID from the FTC as part of its investigation to determine
   whether we, through our Venmo service, have been or are engaged in
   deceptive or unfair practices in violation of the Federal Trade
   Commission Act. The Derivative Cases allege that the Company's Chief
   Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, former interim Chief
   Financial Officer, and certain members of its Board of Directors (the
   "Individual Defendants") breached their fiduciary duties to the
   Company, violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
   and were unjustly enriched by, among other things, causing or
   permitting the Company to issue materially false and misleading
   statements or omissions regarding the Company's compliance with
   applicable laws and regulations with respect to its Venmo service,
   and/or by permitting or causing the Company to engage in unfair trade
   practices through its Venmo service. The Derivative Cases seek, among
   other things, to recover unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of
   the Company arising out of the individual defendants' alleged wrongful
   conduct. Although plaintiffs in the Derivative Cases do not seek relief
   against the Company, we have certain indemnification obligations to the
   individual defendants. On June 30, 2017, the Court issued an order
   approving a stipulation filed by the parties in the Derivative Cases
   that consolidated these cases and appointed co-lead plaintiffs' counsel
   for the consolidated case, captioned In re PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 5:17-cv-00162-RS (the
   "Consolidated Derivative Case"). The Court's order states that it
   applies to each purported derivative action that is subsequently filed
   in, removed to, or transferred to the Court, arising out of the same or
   substantially the same transactions or events as the Derivative
   Cases. On July 31, 2017, plaintiffs' counsel designated the complaint
   filed in the Liss action as the operative complaint for the
   Consolidated Derivative Case. On October 5, 2017, another putative
   shareholder derivative suit was filed in the Court captioned Iron
   Workers Local No. 25 Pension Fund v. John J. Donahoe, et al., Case No.
   5:17-cv-05741-NC, that makes similar allegations and advances similar
   claims against the same Individual Defendants as those at issue in the
   Consolidated Derivative Case. Pursuant to the Court's consolidation
   order, this shareholder derivative suit is part of the Consolidated
   Derivative Case. On September 28, 2017, we filed

   109
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   a motion to dismiss the operative complaint on grounds that plaintiffs
   lack standing to pursue claims on behalf of the Company because they
   did not make a pre-suit demand on the Company's Board of Directors
   prior to filing the Derivative Cases and failed to establish that
   making such a demand would have been futile. On January 18, 2018, the
   Court granted our motion to dismiss with leave to amend and gave
   plaintiffs 30 days from that date to file an amended complaint. On
   February 16, 2018, plaintiffs in the Consolidated Derivative Case filed
   an amended complaint. Plaintiffs' counsel also sent a letter dated
   February 15, 2018 to the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors,
   demanding on behalf of plaintiffs that the Board take action to remedy
   the violations of law allegedly committed by the Individual Defendants
   in the Consolidated Derivative Case. In April 2018, the Individual
   Defendants in the Consolidated Derivative Case entered into a tolling
   agreement with plaintiffs that tolls the running of any statute of
   limitations applicable to the claims at issue in the lawsuit and the
   demand plaintiffs made on the Company's Board of Directors until 30
   days from the time the Board issues a final response to the demand or
   three years elapse from the date of the tolling agreement, whichever
   comes first. Pursuant to that agreement, plaintiffs in the Consolidated
   Derivative Case have voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit without
   prejudice. On October 1, 2018, the Board issued its final response to
   the demand, which informed plaintiffs' counsel that the Board had
   determined that it is not in the best interests of the Company and its
   shareholders to pursue the claims alleged in the demand or to undertake
   any further action in response to the demand.

   In November 2017, we announced that we had suspended the operations of
   TIO Networks ("TIO") as part of an ongoing investigation of security
   vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. On December 1, 2017 we announced
   that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to TIO's
   network, including locations that stored personal information of some
   of TIO's customers and customers of TIO billers and the potential
   compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6
   million customers. We have received a number of governmental inquiries,
   including from state attorneys general, and we may be subject to
   additional governmental inquiries and investigations in the future. In
   addition, on December 6, 2017, a putative class action lawsuit
   captioned Sgarlata v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No.
   3:17-cv-06956 was filed in the Court against the Company, its Chief
   Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and Hamed Shahbazi, the
   former chief executive officer of TIO (the "Defendants") alleging
   violations of federal securities laws. Specifically, the lawsuit
   alleges that Defendants made false or misleading statements or failed
   to disclose that TIO's data security program was inadequate to
   safeguard the personally identifiable information of its users, those
   vulnerabilities threatened continued operation of TIO's platform, the
   Company's revenues derived from TIO services were thus unsustainable,
   and consequently, the Company overstated the benefits of the TIO
   acquisition, and, as a result, the Company's public statements were
   materially false and misleading at all relevant times. The plaintiff
   who initiated the lawsuit sought to represent a class of shareholders
   who acquired shares of the Company's common stock between February 14,
   2017 through December 1, 2017 and sought damages and attorneys' fees,
   among other relief. On March 16, 2018, the Court appointed two new
   plaintiffs, not the original plaintiff who filed the case, as interim
   co-lead plaintiffs in the case and appointed two law firms as interim
   co-lead counsel. On June 13, 2018, the interim co-lead plaintiffs filed
   an amended complaint, which named TIO Networks ULC, TIO Networks USA,
   Inc., and John Kunze (the Company's Vice President, Global Consumer
   Products and Xoom) as additional defendants. The amended complaint is
   purportedly brought on behalf of all persons other than the Defendants
   who acquired the Company's securities between November 10, 2017 and
   December 1, 2017. The amended complaint alleges that the Company's and
   TIO's November 10, 2017 announcement of the suspension of TIO's
   operations was false and misleading because the announcement only
   disclosed security vulnerabilities on TIO's platform, rather than an
   actual security breach that Defendants were allegedly aware of at the
   time of the announcement. Defendants' filed their motion to dismiss the
   amended complaint on July 13, 2018 and the Court heard oral argument on
   the motion to dismiss on September 20, 2018. On December 13, 2018, the
   Court dismissed Plaintiff's amended complaint without prejudice.
   Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on January 14, 2019.We may
   be subject to additional litigation relating to TIO's data security
   platform or the suspension of TIO's operations in the future. See Note
   4--"Business Combinations" and Note 5--"Goodwill and Intangible Assets"
   to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure
   relating to the suspension of operations of TIO.

   General Matters

   Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may
   claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property
   rights. We are subject to patent disputes and expect that we will
   increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims
   involving various aspects of our business as our products and services
   continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought
   directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our
   customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under
   their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to
   such claims as a result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases
   where we are introducing new products or services in connection with
   such acquisitions. We have in the past been forced to litigate such
   claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims
   will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether
   meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and
   resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing
   business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing
   agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle
   claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.

   110
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory
   inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including
   suits by our customers (individually or as class actions) alleging,
   among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or
   policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies, or customer/user
   agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or
   not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies, or
   agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory
   inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and/or legal
   review and/or challenges that tend to reflect the increasing global
   regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when
   taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative action, such
   actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens
   on our business and customers and may lead to increased costs and
   decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and
   significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as we have
   grown larger, our business has expanded in scope (both in terms of the
   range of products and services that we offer and our geographical
   operations), and our products and services have increased in
   complexity. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether
   meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly
   litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory
   damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines,
   penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business
   through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our
   business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of
   management time, result in the diversion of significant operational
   resources, or otherwise harm our business.

   Indemnification Provisions

   We entered into a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters
   agreement, an operating agreement and various other agreements with
   eBay Inc. ("eBay") to govern the separation of the two companies in
   2015 and the relationship of the two companies going forward. These
   agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for
   both eBay and us. Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others
   may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could
   materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations,
   and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have
   against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us,
   and our indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.

   In the ordinary course of business, we include limited indemnification
   provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have
   commercial relationships. Under these contracts, we generally
   indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party
   for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection
   with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names,
   trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent that such
   marks are related to the subject agreement. We have provided an
   indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which are indemnities
   mainly related to intellectual property rights, confidentiality,
   willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of
   contract claims. We have also provided an indemnity to our payments
   processors in the event of card association fines against the processor
   arising out of conduct by us or our customers. It is not possible to
   determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification
   provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims
   and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
   situation. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either
   individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification
   provisions.



   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet
   arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
   future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
   of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

   Protection Programs

   We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most
   transactions completed on our Payments Platform, except for
   transactions using our gateway products or where our customer
   agreements specifically do not provide for protections. These programs
   protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud
   and counterparty performance. Our Buyer Protection Program provides
   protection to consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the
   consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does
   not arrive or does not match the seller's description. Our Seller
   Protection Programs provide protection to merchants against claims that
   a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item
   was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the
   payment on eligible sales. These protection programs are considered
   assurance-type warranties for which we estimate and record associated
   costs in transaction and loan losses during the period the payment
   transaction is completed.

   111
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   The maximum potential exposure under our protection programs is
   estimated to be the portion of total eligible transaction volume (TPV)
   for which buyer or seller protection claims may be raised under our
   existing user agreements. Since eligible transactions are typically
   completed in a period significantly shorter than the period under which
   disputes may be opened, and based on our historical losses to date, we
   do not believe that the maximum potential exposure is representative of
   our actual potential exposure. The actual amount of potential exposure
   cannot be quantified as we are unable to determine total eligible
   transactions where performance by a merchant or consumer is incomplete
   or completed transactions that may result in a claim under our
   protection programs. We record a liability with respect to losses under
   these protection programs when they are probable and the amount can be
   reasonably estimated. The following table shows changes in the
   allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances related
   to our protection programs for the year end December 31, 2018 and 2017:

   Note 14--Stock Repurchase Programs

   In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
   program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our
   common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In
   April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock
   repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $5 billion
   of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization.
   This program became effective upon completion of the January 2016 stock
   repurchase program in December 2017. In July 2018, our Board of
   Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that
   provides for the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock,
   with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program will
   become effective upon completion of the April 2017 stock repurchase
   program. Our stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the
   impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject
   to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make
   opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding
   share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs
   may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately
   negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase
   agreements, or other means at times and in such amounts as management
   deems appropriate and will be funded from cash from operations or other
   financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to
   market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or
   when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock
   repurchase programs at any time without notice.

   In February 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase
   ("ASR") agreement with an unrelated third party financial institution
   to repurchase shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the ASR
   agreement, we made an upfront payment of approximately $1.0 billion to
   the third party financial institution and received approximately 12.8
   million shares of our common stock during the term of the transaction,
   which ended in March 2018. The total number of shares of our common
   stock repurchased was based on the volume-weighted average share price
   of our common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount
   and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the ASR agreement.
   We recorded the initial payment of $1.0 billion as a reduction to
   stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. All common
   stock received was recorded as treasury stock and the forward contract
   indexed to our own common stock met all applicable criteria for equity
   classification.

   Note 15--Stock-Based and Employee Savings Plans

   Equity Incentive Plan

   Under the terms of the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015
   Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"), equity awards, including
   stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), restricted stock awards
   ("RSAs"), performance based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs"), deferred
   stock units ("DSUs"), and stock payments may be granted to our
   directors, officers, and employees. In May 2018, our stockholders
   approved increasing the number of shares reserved for issuance under
   the Plan by an additional 37 million shares . At December 31,
   2018, there were 97 million shares authorized under the Plan and 71
   million shares were available for future grant. Shares issued as a
   result of stock option exercises and the release of stock awards were
   funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of common stock.

   All stock options granted under the Plan generally
   vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one year from the
   date of hire for grants to new employees) with the remainder vesting at
   a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and generally expire seven years
   from the date of grant. The cost of stock options is determined using
   the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of grant. We
   discontinued granting stock options in January 2016.

   RSUs are granted to eligible employees under the Plan. In general, RSUs
   vest in equal annual installments over a period of three years, are
   subject to an employee's continuing service to us, and do not have an
   expiration date. The cost of RSUs granted is determined using the fair
   market value of PayPal's common stock on the date of grant.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   Certain of our executives and non-executives are eligible to receive
   PBRSUs, which are equity awards that may be earned based on an initial
   target number with the final number of PBRSUs that may be vested and
   settled determined based on the Company's performance against
   pre-established performance metrics over a predefined performance
   period. PBRSUs granted under the Plan generally have one to three-year
   performance periods with cliff vesting following the completion of the
   performance period, subject to the Compensation Committee's approval of
   the level of achievement against the pre-established performance
   targets. Over the performance period, the number of PBRSUs that may be
   issued and related stock-based compensation expense that is recognized
   is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving
   the approved performance targets against the performance metrics.
   Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established
   performance targets, the number of PBRSUs issued could range from 0% to
   200% of the target amount.

   Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   In May 2018, our stockholders approved increasing the number of shares
   reserved for issuance under the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings,
   Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") by an additional 50 million
   shares. Under the terms of the ESPP, shares of our common stock may be
   purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of two years
   at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the
   applicable offering period or on the last business day of each
   six-month purchase period within the offering period. Employees may
   contribute between 2% and 10% of their gross compensation during an
   offering period to purchase shares, but not more than the statutory
   limitation of $25,000 per year. The company stock purchased through the
   ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average
   outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings
   per share. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our
   employees purchased 2.4 million, 2.7 million, and 2.7 million shares
   under the ESPP at an average per share price of $43.09, $34.06, and
   $29.49, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 53
   million shares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

   options were in-the-money.

   During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the aggregate
   intrinsic value of RSUs and PBRSUs vested under the Plan was $1.4
   billion, $519 million, and $378 million, respectively.

   In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted 1.6 million
   PBRSUs with a one-year performance period (fiscal 2018) and cliff
   vesting following the completion of the performance period in February
   2019 (one year from the annual incentive award cycle grant date) and
   0.8 million PBRSUs with a three-year performance period. Additionally,
   in the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted 0.4 million
   PBRSUs with a five-year performance period based on market conditions;
   the number of PBRSUs that may be issued under this award is fixed.

   In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted 2.9 million
   PBRSUs with a one-year performance period and cliff vesting following
   the completion of the performance period in February 2018 (one year
   from the annual incentive award cycle grant date) and 1.3 million
   PBRSUs with a three-year performance period.

   Stock-Based Compensation Expense

   We record stock-based compensation expense for the Plan in accordance
   with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement and recognition of
   compensation expense based on estimated fair values.

   The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based
   compensation expense under the Plan for the years ended December 31,
   2018, 2017, and 2016 was as follows:

   As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $883 million of
   unearned stock-based compensation estimated to be expensed from 2019
   through 2020. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the
   underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase,
   or cancel all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based
   compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will
   increase to the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the
   mix of grants between stock options and RSUs, or assume unvested equity
   awards in connection with acquisitions.

   Employee Saving Plan

   Under the terms of the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation
   Plan, which also qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code,
   participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their eligible
   compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In the years ended
   December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, under the PayPal plan, eligible
   employees received one dollar for each dollar contributed, up to 4% of
   each employee's eligible salary, subject to a maximum employer
   contribution of $11,200, $10,800, and $10,600, respectively, per
   employee. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans.
   For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the matching
   contribution expense for our U.S. and international savings plans was
   approximately $51 million, $47 million, and $42 million, respectively.

   Note 16--Income Taxes

   On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs
   Act (the "Tax Act"). The Tax Act included significant changes to the
   U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate
   reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest
   expense and executive compensation; creation of the base erosion
   anti-abuse tax ("BEAT"), a new minimum tax; and the transition of U.S.
   international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified
   territorial tax system. The change to a modified territorial tax system
   resulted in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which had
   not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the "Transition Tax"),
   with future distributions not subject to U.S. federal income tax when
   repatriated. A majority of the provisions in the Tax Act were effective
   January 1, 2018.

   In response to the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued guidance on accounting
   for the tax effects of the Tax Act. The guidance provided a one-year
   measurement period for companies to complete the accounting.

   In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act,
   we recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $180
   million for the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense
   consisted of provisional estimates of $1,468 million net expense for
   the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295
   million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on
   unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for
   remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
   corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

   During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting
   for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We recognized additional
   discrete net tax expense of $20 million to the provisional amounts
   recorded at December 31, 2017 for the enactment-date effects of the Tax
   Act, for a total of $200 million of discrete net tax expense which
   consists of $1,490 million of net federal and state Transition Tax, the
   majority of which is payable in installments over eight years, $1,295
   million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on
   unremitted foreign earnings, and $5 million net expense for
   remeasurement of our deferred tax assets/liabilities for the corporate
   rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

   We elected to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI")
   as a current-period expense when incurred.

   In connection with the distribution, eBay and PayPal entered into
   various agreements that govern the relationship between the parties
   going forward, including a tax matters agreement. The tax matters
   agreement was entered into on the distribution date. Under the tax
   matters agreement, eBay is generally responsible for all additional
   taxes (and will be entitled to all related refunds of taxes) imposed on
   eBay and its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries that were transferred
   to PayPal pursuant to the separation) arising after the distribution
   date with respect to the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ended on
   or prior to July 17, 2015, except for those taxes for which PayPal has
   reflected an unrecognized tax benefit in its financial statements on
   the distribution date.

   the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the difference between the

   state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019.
   Approximately $10 million of the foreign net operating loss
   carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021, $24 million will expire in
   2034 and $357 million has no expiration date and may be carried forward
   indefinitely. As of December 31, 2018, our federal and state tax credit
   carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $29 million
   and $137 million, respectively. The federal tax credits will begin to
   expire in 2028. Most of the state tax credits may be carried forward
   indefinitely.

   In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
   considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion
   of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have elected the
   tax law ordering approach to assess the realizability of our net
   operating losses. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and
   2016, we increased our valuation allowance by $39 million, $50 million,
   and $11 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we
   maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our
   deferred tax assets relating to operating losses in certain states and
   foreign jurisdictions and tax credits in certain states that we believe
   are not likely to be realized.

   At December 31, 2018, none of our unremitted foreign earnings of
   approximately $6.9 billion, are considered to be indefinitely
   reinvested. We have accrued $35 million of deferred U.S. state and
   foreign withholding taxes on the $6.9 billion of undistributed foreign
   earnings.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   We benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different
   jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore and Luxembourg. These
   rulings result in significantly lower rates of taxation on certain
   classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and
   employment in those jurisdictions. We review our compliance on an
   annual basis to ensure we continue to meet our obligations under these
   tax rulings. These rulings resulted in tax savings of approximately
   $465 million, $443 million and $310 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016,
   respectively. The benefit of these tax rulings on our net income per
   share (diluted) was approximately $0.39, $0.36 and $0.25 in 2018, 2017
   and 2016, respectively. These tax rulings are currently in effect and
   expire in 2020.

   The following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for
   the periods presented below:

   $
   312

   If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in
   a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $757 million.

   During the year ended December 31, 2018, we increased our unrecognized
   tax benefits by $194 million due to uncertainties related to the
   impacts of the Tax Act.



   In December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized net interest and
   penalties of $57 million, $13 million, and $13 million, respectively,
   related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The amount of
   interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was
   approximately $124 million and $75 million, respectively.

   We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign
   jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by certain tax
   authorities for the 2003 to 2017 tax years. The material jurisdictions
   in which we are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years
   after 2002 primarily include the U.S. (Federal and California), France,
   Germany, India, Israel, and Singapore. During 2018, we settled our
   audit with Italy. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved
   for any adjustments that may ultimately result from our open
   examinations.

   Although the timing of the resolution of these audits is uncertain, we
   do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of
   December 31, 2018 will materially change in the next 12 months.
   However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and
   the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the
   full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized
   tax benefits.

   Note 17--Restructuring

   In the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, management approved strategic
   reductions of the existing global workforce, which resulted in
   restructuring charges of $25 million and $40 million, respectively. The
   reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 also included
   restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down TIO
   operations. We incurred employee and severance benefits expenses under
   both the 2018 and 2017 strategic reductions, which were substantially
   completed by the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

   No restructuring expenses were recognized during the year ended
   December 31, 2016.
