   Presentation of Information

   On July 17, 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal Holdings") became an
   independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution
   by eBay Inc. ("eBay") of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal
   Holdings to eBay's stockholders (which we refer to as the "separation"
   or the "distribution"). For additional information, see
   "Business--Separation from eBay Inc." To accomplish this separation, in
   January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc., which ultimately
   became the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all
   of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. Unless
   otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires,
   references to "we," "our," "us," "the Company" or "PayPal" refer to
   PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case
   of information as of dates or for periods prior to our separation from
   eBay, the consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay,
   including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that
   were historically held at the eBay corporate level, but were
   specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business,
   and references to our "Payments Platform" mean our combined payment
   solution capabilities, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree,
   Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products.

   References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "eBay" refer to eBay
   Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, which
   prior to the separation and distribution, but not after such date,
   included the business and operations of PayPal.

   Trademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks

   PayPal owns or has rights to use the trademarks, service marks and
   trade names that it uses in conjunction with the operation of its
   business. Some of the more important trademarks that PayPal owns or has
   rights to use that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include:
   PayPal®, PayPal Credit®, Braintree, Venmo and Xoom, which may be
   registered or trademarked in the United States and other jurisdictions.
   PayPal's rights to some of these trademarks may be limited to select
   markets. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other
   company appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is, to PayPal's
   knowledge, owned by such other company.

   ITEM 1. BUSINESS

   Overview

   PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and
   is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that
   enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and
   merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services,
   as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people,
   not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for
   consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the
   world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined
   payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree,
   Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments
   Platform.

   We operate a two-sided proprietary global technology platform that
   links our customers, both merchants and consumers, around the globe to
   facilitate the processing of payment transactions, allowing us to
   connect millions of merchants and consumers worldwide. We offer our
   customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and be
   paid for goods, as well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable
   consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety
   of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account
   balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit and debit card or other
   stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. Our PayPal, Venmo
   and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family
   to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end
   payments solution that provides authorization and settlement
   capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants
   connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to
   engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global
   reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling
   overseas and cross-border trade.

   We generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction
   processing and other payment-related services, primarily based on the
   volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform. We
   generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts;
   however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged to exchange
   currencies. We also earn revenue by providing value added services to
   consumers and merchants, such as our PayPal Credit and gateway
   services. Our gateway services include our Payflow Gateway services and
   Braintree Gateway service that enable merchants to accept payments
   online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services provide the
   technology that links a merchant's website to its processing network
   and merchant account.

   Strategy

   Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things,
   consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital
   payment methods other than cash, the expansion of multiple commerce
   channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant applications on
   those devices, the growth of consumers globally with Internet and
   mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital
   forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our
   ability to innovate new methods of payment that merchants and consumers
   value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the
   following:

   4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o Growing our core: through expanding our global capabilities, customer
   base and scale, increasing our customers use of our products and
   services by better addressing their everyday needs related to
   accessing, managing and moving money and expanding the adoption of our
   solutions by new merchants and consumers;

   o Expanding our value proposition for customers: by focusing on trust
   and simplicity, providing risk management and insights from our
   two-sided Payments Platform and being technology and platform agnostic;

   o Extending through strategic partnerships: by building new strategic
   partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, such as
   offering greater choice and flexibility, to acquire new customers and
   reinforce our role in the ecosystem; and

   o Seeking new areas of growth: through new international markets around
   the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and the
   physical world.

   Key Performance Metrics

   ppannualreport2016keymetrics.jpg

   We measure the relevance of our products to our customers, and
   therefore the success of our business, through active customer
   accounts, payment volume and payment transactions:

   Active Customer Accounts: An active customer account is a registered
   account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or
   payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions
   processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12
   months. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 197 million
   active customer accounts across more than 200 markets. A market is a
   geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country,
   territory, or protectorate, in which we offer our services. A country,
   territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and
   regulations.

   Total Payment Volume ("TPV"): TPV is the value of payments, net of
   payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments
   Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and
   Paydiant products.

   Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is
   defined as the total number of payments, net of payment reversals,
   successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding
   transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.

   Our Strengths

   Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to differentiate
   us from our competitors and drive growth. We believe that our
   competitive strengths include the following:

   o Two-sided Platform - our platform connecting merchants and consumers
   enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while
   gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our
   platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions while
   being both brand and technology agnostic.

   o Scale - our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of
   December 31, 2016, we had 197 million active customer accounts which
   included 15 million active merchant accounts, and in 2016, we processed
   $354 billion of TPV in more than 200 markets around the world.

   o Brand - we have built a well-recognized and trusted brand. Our
   marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility,
   usage and overall preference among customers.

   o Risk Management - our risk management system and tokenization usage
   are designed to keep our customers safer and to process legitimate
   transactions around the world while minimizing illegal, high-risk, or
   fraudulent transactions.

   o Regulatory - we believe that our regulatory licenses, which give us
   the ability to operate in markets around the world, are a clear
   advantage and support business growth.

   Technology

   Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary
   technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided
   by third parties to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions
   between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different
   channels, markets and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with
   financial institutions around the world and allows consumers to make
   purchases using a broad range of payment methods, regardless of where a
   merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can engage
   in cross-border shopping by sending payments in more than 200 markets
   across the globe and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to
   their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal
   accounts in 25 currencies.

   A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple
   participants in addition to us: a merchant, a consumer and the
   consumer's funding source provider. The following diagram illustrates a
   typical payment transaction between a consumer and a merchant using our
   PayPal product on our Payments Platform:

     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   ppannualreport2016service.jpg

   We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools on our
   Payments Platform, transaction processing, database and network
   applications that help our customers to utilize our suite of products
   and services. Our Payments Platform, open application programming
   interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to
   innovate with ease and to offer robust applications to a global
   ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time
   maintaining the security of our customers' financial information.

   The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform
   simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases
   the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and
   services, and automates much of the administration of large-scale
   clusters of computers. Our technology infrastructure has been designed
   around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event
   of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform
   incorporates multiple layers of protection, both for continuity and
   system redundancy purposes and to help address cyber-security
   challenges. We engage in multiple efforts to protect our technology
   infrastructure and Payments Platform against these challenges,
   including regularly testing our systems to address potential
   vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology
   infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience
   and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security.

   Consumer and Merchant Payment Solutions

   Our combined payment solution capabilities were built to offer our
   customers, both consumers and merchants, a broad range of products and
   services in the digital and mobile age, allowing our consumers to make
   seamless transactions across different markets and networks while
   enabling our merchants to safely and simply receive payments from their
   customers.

   We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses
   by improving sales conversion, providing global reach, offering
   alternative payment methods, reducing losses through proprietary
   protection programs, and leveraging data analytics. Online and mobile
   merchants can onboard quickly with PayPal and are not required to
   invest in new or specialized hardware. For our standard service, we do
   not charge merchants setup or recurring fees. We offer credit products
   to certain small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working
   Capital ("PPWC") product which, for a fee, allows them to borrow a
   certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal.
   We believe that our PPWC product allows us to deepen our engagement
   with our small and medium-sized business merchants by providing them
   capital to grow their business that they may not otherwise have
   effective or efficient access to from banks or other lending providers.

   PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our
   business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. Our
   Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and
   extend our coverage to a new class of retailers that offer their
   services primarily through mobile applications. Through a single
   Braintree integration, a merchant can begin

   7
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, Android Pay,
   Apple Pay, digital currencies such as Bitcoin, or other payment
   solutions. We also offer gateway services including our Payflow Gateway
   services and Braintree Gateway service that enable merchants to accept
   payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services
   provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant's website
   to its processing network and merchant account.

   We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to
   democratize access to and movement of money. We offer our customers the
   flexibility to use their account to both purchase and be paid for
   goods, as well as transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to
   more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety of financial
   resources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance,
   a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card or other stored value
   products such as coupons and gift cards. We generally do not charge
   consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate
   revenue from consumers on fees charged to exchange currencies and on
   interest and fees from our PayPal Credit products. We offer our PayPal
   Credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout.
   Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made easily
   available as a funding source in their account. We believe that our
   consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with both
   consumers and merchants on our two-sided network as well as
   differentiate ourselves from rival payment processors by helping
   merchants drive incremental sales through products like PayPal Credit.
   We are responsible for all servicing functions related to all of our
   credit products. In the U.S., all credit originated through our PayPal
   Credit and PPWC products is currently extended through third-party
   financial institutions with whom we partner, and from whom we purchase
   the related receivables. For our consumer credit products outside the
   U.S., we extend credit through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary. For
   our merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend working
   capital advances in the U.K. through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary,
   and we extend working capital advances in Australia through an
   Australian subsidiary. We continue to evaluate partnerships and
   third-party sources of funding of our credit portfolio, including, but
   not limited to, commercial banks, securitization markets, private
   equity firms and sovereign wealth funds.

   We offer consumers person-to-person ("P2P") payment solutions through
   our PayPal website and mobile application, Venmo and Xoom. Our Venmo
   app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money
   between friends and family with their mobile device. Xoom is an
   international money transfer service that enables our customers to send
   money to, pay bills for and send prepaid mobile phone reloads
   for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and
   cost-effective way, using their mobile device or personal computers.
   P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel with network effects
   that help to establish relationships with potential PayPal users by
   allowing them to join our Payments Platform at the time of making or
   receiving payments, which drives organic customer-driven growth.

   Protecting Merchants and Consumers

   Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from
   financial and data loss is imperative to successfully competing in the
   payments industry and growing our business sustainably. The risk to
   merchants and consumers (and their payments partners) from fraudulent
   activities, such as account takeover, identity theft and counterparty
   malicious activities, is growing. We provide merchants and consumers
   with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed
   through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our
   gateway and Paydiant products. We believe that these programs, which
   protect both merchants and consumers from financial and data loss
   primarily due to fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally
   much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in
   the payments industry. Many payments providers do not offer merchant
   protection in general, and those that do so generally do not provide
   protection for online or card not present transactions. As a result,
   merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain
   transactions when using other payments providers that they would not
   incur if they used our payments services. We also provide consumer
   protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for
   180 days post transaction in the markets that we serve. We believe that
   this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that
   offered by other payments providers. We believe that as a result of
   these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be
   required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as
   described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive
   payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer.

   Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on
   our proprietary end-to-end payments platform, our ability to leverage
   the data we collect on both sides of the transactions, from buyers and
   sellers, or from senders and receivers of money, on our two-sided
   network. We believe mobile devices will play an important part in the
   future of commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make our
   ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able to use location data from
   mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating
   environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers. Our ongoing
   investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and
   security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized
   as one of the world's most trusted payments brands.

   Competition

   The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against
   a wide range of businesses, including banks, credit card providers,
   technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers, many of
   which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or
   offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we
   do not offer. We compete against all forms of payments, including
   credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers;
   other online payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment
   methods, including cash and check.

   We compete primarily on the basis of the following:

   o ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers
   with our two-sided platform;

   o ability to show that merchants may achieve incremental sales by
   offering our end-to-end services;

   o consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our
   Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our
   products and services without sharing their financial information with
   the merchant or the party they are paying;

   o simplicity of our fee structure;

   o ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce
   channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of
   sale;

   o trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection
   programs;

   o customer service;

   o brand recognition;

   o website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and
   accessibility;

   o the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;

   o system reliability and data security;

   o ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications
   and operating systems; and

   o quality of developer tools such as our application programming
   interfaces and software development kits.

   In addition to the discussion in this section, see "Item 1A. Risk
   Factors" under the caption "Substantial and increasingly intense
   competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our
   business" for further discussion of the potential impact of competition
   on our business.

   Research and Development

   Total research and development expense was $834 million, $792 million
   and $747 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

   Intellectual Property

   The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks
   (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents, copyrights,
   domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success
   of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying
   on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as
   well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on
   contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products
   and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and
   invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and
   nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to
   control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information.

   We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service
   marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S.
   and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our
   proprietary technology. We have registered our core brands as
   trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other
   jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure
   trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of
   interest.

   For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our
   intellectual property, including costs of protecting our intellectual
   property, see the information in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the
   captions "We are subject to patent litigation" and

   property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing

   Government Regulation

   We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment
   characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the
   payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened
   as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as
   countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and
   consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are
   subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable
   to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and
   mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and
   regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws
   and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to
   non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their
   interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations
   applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business,
   results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor
   these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who
   depend on us.

   Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are
   subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets
   we operate.

   Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments
   industry in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. holds
   licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which,
   among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to reporting requirements,
   bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds
   and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we
   provide localized versions of our service to customers through various
   foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or
   may, be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the
   jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory
   authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur
   Financier (the "CSSF"), the Australian Securities and Investment
   Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of
   India, and the Central Bank of Russia have asserted jurisdiction over
   some or all of our activities in country. This list is not exhaustive,
   as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert
   jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable
   to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to
   interpretation and change.

   Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European
   Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned
   subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in
   Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and
   regulations of the banking industry, including those related to
   capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money
   laundering, disclosure, reporting and inspection. We also are, or may
   be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in
   the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition,
   based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions in
   the U.S., we are subject to indirect regulation and examination by
   these financial institutions' regulators.

   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection
   Bureau (the "CFPB") has significant authority to regulate consumer
   financial products in the United States, including consumer credit,
   deposit, payment, and similar products. As a large market participant
   of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over
   our business. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other
   jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could
   result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations
   that may affect our business.

   Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is
   subject to anti-money laundering ("AML") laws and regulations in the
   U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the
   use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. We
   have implemented a comprehensive AML program designed to prevent our
   payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering,
   terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in
   countries or with persons and entities included on designated country
   or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's
   Office of Foreign Assets Controls ("OFAC") and equivalent authorities
   in other countries. Our AML compliance program, overseen by our
   compliance officer, is composed of policies, procedures and internal
   controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory
   requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist
   financing risks.

   Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments
   systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For
   example, in the European Union, the Multilateral Interchange Fee
   ("MIF") Regulation (which became effective in December 2015) caps
   credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for
   business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card
   transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect
   in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory
   challenge.

   Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or
   business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the
   United States, the European Union and elsewhere. For example, in the
   United States, we are subject to information safeguarding requirements
   under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a
   written, comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the
   operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to information
   safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act, among other
   laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous
   legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data
   protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of these
   privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and
   elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.

   Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws,
   such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery
   Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it
   operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising,
   giving, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either
   directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in
   order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business
   advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented
   policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply
   with these laws and regulations.

   Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies
   continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual
   currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy,
   disclosure rules, security and marketing that may impact PayPal's
   business.

   For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our
   business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our
   payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data
   use and/or security in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the caption "Risk
   Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and
   Financial Condition" and "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" included elsewhere
   in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Seasonality

   The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to
   net revenues. No individual quarter in 2016, 2015 or 2014 accounted for
   more than 30% of annual net revenue.

   Financial Information About Segments

   We operate in one business segment and have one reportable segment. See
   "Note 11--Segment and Geographical Information" to the consolidated
   financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
   10-K for additional information including certain financial information
   about our operations in the U.S. and abroad. Additionally, please see
   the information in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the caption "Our
   international operations are subject to increased risks, which could
   harm our business," which describes risks associated with our foreign
   operations.

   Employees

   As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 18,100 people
   globally, of whom approximately 10,180 were located in the U.S. We
   consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

   Separation from eBay Inc.

   PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for
   the purpose of owning and operating eBay's Payments business in
   connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior
   to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which
   occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the "distribution date"), PayPal
   became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata
   distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal
   to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the "separation" or the
   "distribution"). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of
   business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for
   every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately
   1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17,
   2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal's common stock began "regular way"
   trading under the ticker symbol "PYPL" on The NASDAQ Stock Market on
   July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially
   all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments
   business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015.

   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

   The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first
   section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses
   some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of
   operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned
   "Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent
   Publicly Traded Company," discusses some of the risks relating to our
   separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third
   section, captioned "Risks Related to Our Common Stock," discusses some
   of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should
   carefully review all of these sections for important information
   regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us, in addition to the
   other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
   including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The
   risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
   Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we
   currently believe are not material, may also become important factors
   that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks
   actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of
   operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely
   affected.



   Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and
   Financial Condition

   Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the
   global payments industry may harm our business.

   The global payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete
   against a wide range of businesses, many of which are larger than we
   are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and
   services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. As online
   and offline commerce are increasingly converging, the pace of change,
   innovation and disruption is also increasing. The global payments
   industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly
   subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect the
   competitive landscape. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve
   rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs,
   and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition
   may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants
   enter into business combinations and alliances, and established
   companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with
   our business. We compete against a wide range of businesses with
   varying roles in all forms of payments, including:

   o paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);

   o providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and
   debit cards, and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular,
   well-established banks);

   o payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;

   o providers of "digital wallets" which offer customers the ability to
   pay online and/or on mobile devices through a variety of payment
   methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless
   payments, and with a variety of payment cards;

   o providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data
   approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication
   functionality or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the
   need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification
   number or password;

   o payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants,
   including for "card on file" payments where the merchant invites the
   consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction, and
   subsequently uses the same payment method for subsequent transactions;

   12
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o providers of "person-to-person" payments that facilitate individuals
   sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;

   o merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment
   networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;

   o money remitters;

   o providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other
   point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and

   o providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.

   We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the
   ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our
   business. Competition for relationships with these partners is very
   intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to
   establish, grow or maintain these partner relationships.

   We also face competition and potential competition from:

   o services that provide online merchants the ability to offer their
   customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or
   paying on credit;

   o issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;

   o other global online payment-services providers;

   o other providers of online account-based payments;

   o payment services targeting users of social networks and online
   gaming, including those offering billing to the consumer's mobile phone
   account;

   o mobile payment services between bank accounts;

   o payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking
   customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank
   account;

   o ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific
   payment provider;

   o services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies;
   and

   o electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both
   online and offline transactions, particularly in Germany and the
   Netherlands.

   Some of these competitors have greater customer bases, volume, scale,
   resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant
   competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to
   less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist
   financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater
   resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and
   services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce
   their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our
   growth.

   We compete primarily on the basis of the following:

   o ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;

   o ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by
   offering our PayPal services;

   o consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our
   Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our
   PayPal products and services without sharing their financial
   information with the merchant or the party they are paying;

   o simplicity of our fee structure;

   o ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels,
   including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;

   o trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection
   programs;

   o customer service;

   o brand recognition;

   o website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and
   accessibility;

   o the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;

   o system reliability and data security;

   o ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications
   and operating systems; and

   o quality of developer tools, such as our application programming
   interfaces and software development kits.

   If we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our
   competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our
   resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete
   effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively
   against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and
   adversely harm our business.

   Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from
   transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result
   in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could
   adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
   operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common
   stock.

   Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from
   transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our
   operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during
   our limited operating history and may continue to fluctuate
   significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a
   result of the risks set forth in this "Risk Factors" section. It is
   difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or
   earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of
   our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may
   not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication
   of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting
   revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of
   net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net
   revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly
   different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in
   one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of
   securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common
   stock could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors
   described in this paragraph.

   Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.

   Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and
   regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events
   have negatively impacted global and regional financial markets in the
   past, and uncertainty about global and regional economic events and
   conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing spending
   in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market
   volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news,
   declines in income or asset values, and other factors. These and other
   global and regional economic events and conditions could have a
   material adverse impact on demand for our products and services,
   including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our
   Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the
   banking system or financial markets could cause additional
   consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial
   service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the
   credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in
   the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could
   have a material adverse impact on our business.

   If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide
   new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and
   services and, consequently, our revenues could decline.

   Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to
   impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in
   payment card tokenization, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce
   through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies,
   distributed ledger technologies, near field communication and other
   proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot
   predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In
   addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on
   third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development
   of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and
   technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will
   continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the
   technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing
   and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may
   require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and
   ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new
   products and services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by
   industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and
   regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants,
   third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success
   will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies
   and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if
   we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our
   business could be harmed.

   Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our
   business.

   We pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment
   transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund
   payments with debit cards, nominal fees when consumers fund payment
   transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and
   nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing
   PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our
   financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our
   consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively,
   "payment cards"), which can significantly increase our costs. While we
   provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal
   account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may
   prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer
   functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank
   accounts. Some of our offerings, including the ability of consumers to
   make a limited number of "guest" payments without opening a PayPal
   account, have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic
   product offering. An increase in the portion of our payment volume
   funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix,
   or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly
   for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank
   accounts or existing PayPal account balances, could materially and
   adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our
   business. Some of

   14
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   our plans to lower our funding costs, including our PayPal Credit
   products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of
   time on some transactions, may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by
   consumers.

   Negotiated arrangements with payment card networks and/or issuing
   banks, promoting greater choice and options for consumers to fund
   payment transactions could have an uncertain impact on our business. We
   have entered into a strategic partnership with partners such as Visa
   U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa"), MasterCard International Incorporated
   ("MasterCard") and DFS Services LLC ("Discover") to make it easier for
   merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners' credit
   and/or debt cards and allow us to gain access to these partners
   tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions.
   While we anticipate these and similar strategic partnerships we may
   enter in the future will result in an increase in the number of
   transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate
   that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed
   using a credit or debit card, which would likely increase our funding
   costs. If our transaction volume does not increase as expected, our
   business and results of operations could be adversely affected due to
   increased costs associated with our funding mix.

   Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy
   breaches.

   Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and
   transmission of customers' personal data, including financial
   information. In addition, a significant number of our customers
   authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for
   all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our
   reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a
   secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations,
   including large merchants and businesses, other large technology
   companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have
   disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which
   have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on
   portions of their websites or infrastructure.

   The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access
   to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade
   service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult
   to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against
   a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our
   systems or facilities through various means, including, among others,
   hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers,
   partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce our
   employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems
   into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or
   other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our
   information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored
   and supported by significant financial and technological resources,
   making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We believe
   that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and
   attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread
   adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have
   developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data
   and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches,
   and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to
   bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide
   absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be
   vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may
   be able to access our customers' personal or proprietary information
   and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those
   systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to human error,
   malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities.
   Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our
   operations, result in our systems or services being unavailable, result
   in improper disclosure of data, materially harm our reputation and
   brands, result in significant legal and financial exposure, lead to
   loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and
   services, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
   In addition, any breaches of network or data security at our customers,
   partners or vendors (including data center and cloud computing
   providers) could have similar negative effects. Actual or perceived
   vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against us.

   In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card
   processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we
   store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing
   customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for
   their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to
   expend significant additional resources to protect against security or
   privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by
   breaches. Among other reasons, financial services regulators in various
   jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union ("EU"), have
   implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication
   requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online
   fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our
   business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join
   PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm
   our business. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they
   may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security
   breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under
   these insurance policies.

   Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our
   websites, applications, products or services could harm our business.

   Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may
   experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and
   software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other
   cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires,
   natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications
   services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks,
   computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also
   may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of
   vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our
   disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.
   In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to
   heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business
   continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous
   testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may
   divert our resources from other business priorities.

   We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system
   failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from
   time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the
   speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have
   resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged
   interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability,
   speed or other functionality of our products and services could
   materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in
   our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that
   our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors
   or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our
   reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure
   or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business
   partners, these customers or partners could seek significant
   compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and
   those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and
   costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described
   in this "Risk Factors" section under the caption "Our business is
   subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches."

   Our Payments Platform has experienced significant intermittent
   unavailability. Reliability is particularly critical for us because the
   full-time availability of our products and services is critical to our
   goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for
   digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and
   re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed.
   These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant
   technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and
   products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will
   succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain
   jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to
   regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and
   costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us
   to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay
   us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our
   business.

   We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third
   parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services.
   If these third parties cease to provide the facilities, components or
   services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach
   their agreements with us, or fail to meet our expectations, our
   operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which
   could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and
   brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not
   carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for
   all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a
   result of systems failures and similar events.

   Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices
   could harm our business.

   We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and
   MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards,
   including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on
   banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay
   fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have
   increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and
   assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their
   networks. Payment card networks have or may impose special assessments
   for transactions that are executed through a "digital wallet" such as
   PayPal's, and such fees could particularly impact us and significantly
   increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to
   pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well
   as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange
   fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our
   operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa
   and MasterCard to further expand our relationships with these networks
   in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers
   to choose to pay with Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards.
   During the term of the agreements, Visa and MasterCard have each agreed
   to not enact or impose any fees or rules solely targeted at PayPal.
   Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to
   special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.

   In addition, in some jurisdictions, governments have required Visa and
   MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as
   to whether Visa's or MasterCard's interchange fees and practices
   violate antitrust law. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board issued a
   final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower
   rates than Visa or MasterCard previously charged. In the EU, the
   Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation limits credit and debit
   interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card
   processing services. Any material change in credit or debit card
   interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets,

   16
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could
   adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit
   and debit card service providers. Future changes to those regulations
   could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.

   We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network
   operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service
   providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors
   for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of
   any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks
   set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the
   networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model
   violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved
   favorably, they may result in material fines and penalties or require
   changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card
   networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret
   existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even
   impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could
   lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to
   fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like
   their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment
   cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business
   would be adversely affected.

   We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business
   processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating
   rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with
   these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from
   payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging
   in activities that are illegal or that are considered "high risk,"
   primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For "high risk"
   merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using our PayPal
   services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and
   conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although
   the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional
   fines in the future could become material and could result in a
   termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes
   in our process for registering new customers, which would materially
   harm our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the
   cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the
   development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may
   negatively impact their deployment and adoption.

   Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad
   transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss
   rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and
   consumer confidence in and use of our services.

   We incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants
   have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the
   merchant's description. We seek to recover such losses from the
   merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is
   unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy
   or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or
   services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g.,
   airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods and
   subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or
   services, either through our buyer protection program or through
   chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment.
   While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates
   that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these
   reserves may be insufficient.

   We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not
   authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous
   transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have
   insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses
   incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive,
   they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment
   cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken
   measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures
   need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new
   and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new
   product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could
   be harmed.

   We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

   We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in
   foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The
   strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound,
   Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of
   our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S.
   dollar. Additionally, in connection with providing our services in
   multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign exchange rates twice
   per day. We may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our
   foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign
   exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also
   hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our
   financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S.
   currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our
   assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
   functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into
   transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and
   balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the
   effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could
   significantly impact our financial results.

   17

   Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more
   difficult could harm our business.

   Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer
   are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and
   profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues
   and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a
   single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our
   primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important
   markets.

   Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign
   exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation
   and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the
   jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely
   complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the
   interpretation and/or application of laws applicable to cross-border
   trade could impose additional requirements (which may impose
   conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade and
   increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that
   increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make
   cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our
   revenues and profits and could harm our business.

   The United Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us.

   The United Kingdom ("U.K.") held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which
   a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU ("Brexit").
   Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of
   the U.K.'s relationship with the EU, including, among other things, the
   terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU. The effects of Brexit will
   depend on any agreements the U.K. reaches to retain access to EU
   markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The
   outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets
   and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about
   the terms and impact of Brexit may continue to do so in the future.
   Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and
   worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to
   instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including
   volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn
   could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do
   business, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to
   legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and
   regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or
   replicate. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face
   new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:

   o we could lose our ability for our EU operations to passport into the
   U.K. market through the banking license of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et
   Cie, SCA ("PayPal (Europe)"), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is
   licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg, and our
   corresponding ability to work with Luxembourg regulators as the lead
   authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations;

   o we could be required to obtain additional regulatory licensing to
   operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to
   our business; and

   o we could also be required to comply with regulatory requirements in
   the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory
   requirements of the EU.

   Any of these effects of Brexit and others we cannot anticipate could
   adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
   condition and cash flows.

   Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and
   oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently
   changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations.

   Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and
   oversight. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key
   aspects of our business, please see "Item 1. Business--Government
   Regulation" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is also
   subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations
   in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to,
   those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and
   domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data
   protection, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment
   processing and settlement services), consumer protection, economic and
   trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist
   financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are
   extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and
   may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.

   Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory
   scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view
   matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in
   the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and
   increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and
   tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our
   business.

   As we expand and localize our international activities, we are
   increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the
   countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our
   services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of

   18
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more
   jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply
   with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related
   technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific,
   or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability.
   For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local
   jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of
   Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") or U.S. anti-money
   laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.

   Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws
   and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the
   interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those
   discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines,
   penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant
   assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions;
   result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase
   regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; force us
   to change our business practices, make product or operational changes
   or delay planned product launches or improvements. The foregoing could,
   individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability,
   impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources,
   increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brands and
   business, make our products and services less attractive, result in the
   loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, adversely
   affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation. The
   complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement
   regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the
   evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event
   giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal
   and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in
   different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures
   designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and
   regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees,
   contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations.

   Payments Regulation

   In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money
   transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as
   well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto
   Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and
   services in these states, but also our Venmo and Xoom branded products
   and services. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to
   restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds,
   reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state
   regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or
   regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional
   restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain
   states, forced to change our business practices or be required to
   obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose
   substantial costs.

   While we currently allow our customers with credit cards to send
   payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only
   approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also
   receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the
   manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may
   affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. Of the
   markets whose residents can use our PayPal services, almost 30 of them
   are in member states of the EU.

   We provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe),
   our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation
   as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to
   significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the
   disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, fund
   management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information
   security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements
   imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are
   typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent
   interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can
   make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage.
   Moreover, the countries that are members of the EU may each have
   different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations
   implementing the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money
   Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally
   difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive ("PSD2")
   entered into force in January 2016 and will need to be implemented into
   national legislation by January 2018. The implementation of the PSD2
   may negatively affect our business. Finally, if PayPal (Europe) exceed
   certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank ("ECB") determines
   that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some
   activity of PayPal (Europe) is subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal
   (Europe) or certain of its activities could become directly regulated
   by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de
   Surveillance du Secteur Financier, as its national supervisor, which
   could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase
   compliance costs.

   In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd.
   ("PayPal Australia"), which is licensed by the Australian Securities
   and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product
   and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased
   payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository
   institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant
   fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product
   disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements,
   privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on
   Australian depository institutions.

   19
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   In many of the other markets in which we do business, we serve our
   customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary that is
   based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary
   Authority of Singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value
   facility and does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal
   Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including
   donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for
   the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets
   (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and
   uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to
   Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws,
   whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be
   licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or
   otherwise.

   We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do
   business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to
   apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in
   a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be
   no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses,
   certifications, and approvals. Even if we were able to obtain such
   licenses, certifications, and approvals, there are substantial costs
   and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses,
   certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or
   other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure,
   reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance
   or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose
   substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the
   development or provision of our products or services, or could require
   significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing
   any products or services in a given market.

   In many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to
   be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution
   or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process
   payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency.
   Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local
   merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from
   doing business in a country. Such regulatory actions or the need to
   obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could
   impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision
   or development of our services, require significant and costly
   operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional
   requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products
   or services in a given market. For example, in June 2016, we suspended
   our operations in Turkey following cease and desist instructions from
   Turkey's regulatory body, Bankacýlýk Düzenleme Ve Denetleme Kurumu
   ("BDDK"), following the BDDK's rejection of our application for an
   e-money payments license.

   Consumer Protection

   The financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and
   we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the
   countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal
   and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our
   activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ("EFTA") and
   Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
   ("CFPB"). Under such regulations we are required to provide advance
   disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error
   resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain
   transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements.
   Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could
   result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or
   penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per
   violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we
   could also be liable for plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in such cases. We
   are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits
   containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and
   Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our
   business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or
   otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).

   In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts with
   an effective date of October 1, 2017. The rule's definition of prepaid
   account includes certain loadable accounts whose primary function is to
   conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs
   and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital
   wallets. The rule's requirements include: the disclosure of fees and
   other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid
   account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and
   error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application
   of Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009
   credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit
   features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB
   and their publication to the general public. We are evaluating the rule
   and its requirements. Implementation of the rule could require us to
   make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of
   certain products, allocate additional resources, and increase our
   costs, which could negatively affect our business.

   In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent
   Order ("Consent Order") with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory
   claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The
   Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in
   redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and
   required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures
   and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage
   with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order,
   which may result in us incurring additional costs.

   20
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   PayPal (Europe) offers its services in EU countries through a
   "passport" notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to
   regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU Directives, and has
   completed the "passport" notification process in all EU member
   countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal
   (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business,
   in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek
   to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to
   conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office.
   These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost
   of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries.

   Economic and Trade Sanctions

   We are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by
   OFAC. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were
   inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible
   violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we
   reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising
   from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to
   the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program.
   Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible
   violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking
   additional information about certain of these transactions. Such
   self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against
   us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or
   penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner
   that could result in a material loss, require significant management
   time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or
   otherwise harm our business.

   Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing

   We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
   financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among
   other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal
   activities. U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase
   their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require
   us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the
   procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to
   monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in
   which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
   financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be
   required to make changes to our compliance program in various
   jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the
   transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep
   applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in
   such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the
   EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive
   and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds
   (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation), which both
   come into effect on June 26, 2017, could make compliance more costly
   and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for
   customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for
   non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could
   include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)'s total annual turnover.
   The EU institutions are also proposing changes to the Fourth Anti-Money
   Laundering Directive which could be even more stringent.

   Privacy and Protection of User Data

   We are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we
   refer to as "privacy laws") relating to the collection, use, retention,
   security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as "process") of
   personally identifiable information about our customers and employees
   (which we refer to as "personal data") in the countries where we
   operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially
   financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in
   some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases,
   these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to
   transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and
   other parties with which we have commercial relationships.

   Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and
   sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty
   associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and
   data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot
   predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud
   computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and
   applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent
   or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional
   requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or
   require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our
   business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws
   can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and
   business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may
   restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.
   A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data
   protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and
   other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate,
   materially harm our business and reputation.

   In October 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that the U.S.-EU
   Safe Harbor framework clauses, one compliance method by which companies
   could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the EU to the U.S.,
   could no longer be relied upon. The U.S. and EU authorities have agreed
   in principle on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as "Privacy
   Shield". The Privacy Shield

   approach has not been fully endorsed by all relevant parties and there
   have already been challenges to this initiative in the European justice
   system. PayPal has chosen to adopt EU model clauses published by the
   European Commission as a basis for the export of data from the EU to
   the U.S. for those parts of our business that had previously relied on
   Safe Harbor. In addition, because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in
   Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we
   have relied on the "one-stop-shop" concept under which Luxembourg has
   been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a recent
   European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do
   business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data
   protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU
   member states in which we have established legal entities and which
   apply privacy laws that are different than, and which may even conflict
   with, those in Luxembourg.

   In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails,
   phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers
   for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that
   provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation
   could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For
   example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), in the
   U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of
   $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the
   damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, are, and
   may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action
   lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA.
   These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and
   injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of
   communications we send to our customers, a determination that there
   have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes
   could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually
   or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.

   The EU has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data
   protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a
   single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data
   Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which comes into effect in 2018. The
   proposed EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data
   protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU
   residents. It provides for a harmonization of the data protection
   regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for
   non-European companies to comply with these regulations. It imposes a
   strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to
   the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and EUR20 million and includes
   new rights such as the "portability" of personal data. Although the
   GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing
   legislation, as has been the case under the current data protection
   regime, local data protection authorities ("DPAs") will still have the
   ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create
   inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the
   rule and its requirements. Implementation of the GDPR could require
   changes to certain of our business practices, thereby increasing our
   costs.

   We post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and
   practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data.
   Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted
   privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or
   orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer
   protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more
   jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by
   governmental entities or others, including class action privacy
   litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines,
   penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our
   business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance,
   and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and
   information security have become the subject of increasing public,
   media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their
   use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our
   business could be materially harmed. As noted above, we are also
   subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which
   themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.

   If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on
   their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur
   significant losses.

   We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other
   investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial
   institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging
   activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial
   instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and
   financial institutions are also lenders under our revolving credit
   facility. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit
   risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated
   risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default
   by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or
   failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of
   counterparty default, deterioration or failure may be heightened during
   economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets.
   If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for
   bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of
   default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held
   in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's
   liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy
   proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our
   counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could
   negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

   PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon
   third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our
   business.

   As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to
   make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on a third-party chartered
   financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in
   the U.S., and a different chartered financial institution to issue the
   PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. Both of these chartered
   financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the State of
   Utah. In the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of
   the chartered financial institution that currently issues the PayPal
   Credit consumer product in the U.S. to lend under the PayPal Credit
   consumer product, the chartered financial institution that issues the
   PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. has agreed to take ownership
   of (and originate loans with respect to) all PayPal Credit consumer
   accounts. Nevertheless, any termination or interruption of either
   bank's ability to lend could result in the inability or unwillingness
   to originate any new PayPal Credit or PayPal Working Capital loans. In
   the event of either bank's inability or unwillingness to lend, we would
   either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered
   financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses. We
   may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on
   favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending
   licenses would be a time-consuming and costly process and would subject
   us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be
   burdensome and increase our costs. In addition, our commercial
   relationships with third parties which are federally supervised U.S.
   financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal
   banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide.

   In 2015, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Madden v. Midland
   Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), concluded that the buyer of
   a charged off credit card account could not rely on the National Bank
   Act's preemption of state interest rate limits for interest at rates
   imposed by the buyer after charge-off. A petition to the U.S. Supreme
   Court to review the decision was denied in June 2016, and the case has
   been remanded to the lower court to be determined in accordance with
   the ruling of the Second Circuit. The decision has resulted in some
   uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated
   by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may
   create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our
   ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of
   certain loans. Although the Madden decision specifically addressed
   preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support
   future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions,
   including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like those
   that we rely on to issue our loan products in the U.S. Although we
   believe the Madden case can be distinguished from the manner in which
   we offer our credit products, there can be no assurances as to the
   outcome of any potential litigation, or that the possible impact of
   such litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our
   business.

   Our credit products expose us to additional risks.

   Our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products are offered to a
   wide range of consumers and merchants, and the financial success of
   these products depends on the effective management of the risk related
   to these products. The lender for the PayPal Credit product extends
   credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other
   analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific
   consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with
   PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, to assess a merchant
   who wishes to obtain a PayPal Working Capital advance, among other
   indicators, the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict
   the merchant's ability to repay the working capital advance. These risk
   models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or
   merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or
   merchant or the economic environment or limited transaction history,
   among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability
   of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our
   PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products may also be affected
   by legal or regulatory changes, competitors' actions, changes in
   consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other
   factors.

   Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer
   and merchant credit, we face the risk that PayPal Credit and PayPal
   Working Capital account holders will default on their payment
   obligation, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment
   rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things,
   changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such
   as a recession or greater austerity in various countries, increases in
   prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders
   who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders
   who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not
   repay their loans.

   We purchase receivables related to our PayPal Credit products, and
   originated loans with respect to our PayPal Working Capital Products.
   If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately
   or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently
   manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business
   could be harmed.

   Our international expansion of our PayPal Credit product offerings
   exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under
   the risk factor titled "Our international operations are subject to
   increased risks, which could harm our business."

   23
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Our business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism,
   public health issues, natural disasters and other business
   interruptions.

   War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and
   other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or
   disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis,
   which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our
   customers, and companies with which we do business. Our business
   operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural
   disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power
   plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and
   other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other
   events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our
   products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to
   deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a
   natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require
   substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in
   order to resume operations.

   Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our
   loss rate.

   Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and
   consumers from fraudulent transactions. In 2015, we increased the scope
   of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible
   goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may
   have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a
   bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses
   from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to
   individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted
   by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these
   programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes
   that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of
   transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal
   becoming an independent publicly traded company on July 17, 2015, we
   extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain
   customers' purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these
   programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate,
   including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection
   programs, could harm our business.

   Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which
   could harm our business.

   Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of
   our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our
   ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand
   into international markets, and the foreign currency risks discussed
   earlier in this "Risk Factors" section under the caption "We are
   exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates," there are
   risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic
   (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including:

   o expenses associated with localizing our products and services and
   customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact
   business in the local currency and adapting our products and services
   to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have
   limited or no experience;

   o trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;

   o difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a
   large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance,
   language, and cultural differences;

   o stringent local labor laws and regulations;

   o credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;

   o profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange
   restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
   for a particular currency;

   o political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or
   human rights issues;

   o geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health
   issues, acts of war, and terrorism;

   o import or export regulations;

   o compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt
   payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices
   Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;

   o compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money
   laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;

   o antitrust and competition regulations;

   o potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;

   o economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;

   o different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data
   protection, privacy, and other laws;

   o risks related to other government regulation or required compliance
   with local laws;

   o data localization requirements;

   o risks related to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes,
   which may impose conflicting requirements on us;

   o national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;

   o local licensing and reporting obligations; and

   o increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.

   24

   Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations
   that apply to our international operations may result in fines,
   criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our
   employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to
   our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures
   designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our
   employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks
   are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may
   increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm
   our business.

   We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.

   We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and
   from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we
   hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate
   environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our
   investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in
   interest rates may adversely impact our customers' spending levels and
   ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher
   interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to
   us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer
   loans, which may reduce our customers' ability to remain current on
   their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies,
   charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could
   have an adverse effect on our net income.

   In July 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As a result,
   to the extent of our borrowings under the facility, which bear interest
   at a floating rate, we will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations.

   Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our
   business.

   Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper
   uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online
   gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of
   prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software,
   movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in
   particular, digital goods), money laundering, bank fraud, child
   pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or
   tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other
   illegal activity. Certain activity that may be legal in one country may
   be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or
   inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal
   goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the
   penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain
   illegal activities and additional payments-related proposals are under
   active consideration by government authorities. Intellectual property
   rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action
   against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are
   peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items. Any threatened
   or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any
   resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs
   could harm our business.

   Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our
   customer funds properly could harm our business.

   We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers,
   including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to
   sellers of goods and services. Our ability to manage and account
   accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high
   level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we
   expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our
   associated internal controls. For example, in March 2016, as approved
   by the Supervisory Board of PayPal (Europe) and as permitted by the
   CSSF, certain European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking
   subsidiary are being used to extend credit to our European customers.
   Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to
   properly manage our customers' balances and handle large and growing
   transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to
   maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the
   assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in
   reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of
   our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could
   materially harm our business.

   We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under
   competition laws.

   We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S.
   and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition
   laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights
   of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of
   anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have
   in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the
   antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other
   countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair
   competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating
   competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large
   markets such as China. Our business agreements or arrangements with
   customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or
   antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of
   the U.S., may perceive our business to be used so broadly that
   otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed
   anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without
   foundation, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve
   negative publicity

   and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could
   result in reputational harm, significant judgments against us, or
   require us to change our business practices.

   We are subject to patent litigation.

   We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties'
   patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of
   patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential
   patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to
   patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:

   o our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;

   o we continue to expand into new business areas, including through
   acquisitions; and

   o the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the
   companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their
   patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent
   owners, continues to increase.

   Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers
   whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to
   do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an
   increasing number of these claims against us and other technology
   companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties
   whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition,
   we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in
   some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not,
   are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require
   us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter
   into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments
   to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease
   conducting certain operations, which would harm our business.

   We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual
   property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing
   their intellectual property rights.

   The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks,
   patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is
   important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our
   intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and
   regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of
   administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to
   protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and
   services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements
   entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality
   agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.

   Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in
   every country in which our products and services are made available. We
   may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to
   prevent infringement or to enforce our rights.

   Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual
   property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
   in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that
   contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect
   our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or
   misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent
   development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by
   others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,
   registering or using trademarks and trade dress that
   infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value
   of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely
   affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent
   of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in
   the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our
   proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to
   others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our
   proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately
   protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant
   costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible
   assets and materially harm our business.

   As the number of products in the technology and payments industries
   increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and
   as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may
   become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and
   other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and
   scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
   The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and,
   regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may
   be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management's
   time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other
   things, stop providing transaction processing and other payment-related
   services or redesign, stop selling our products or services, pay
   substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits,
   pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification
   obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have
   commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or
   other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual
   property matters, may harm our business.

   26
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes,
   and government inquiries.

   We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action
   lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or
   requests, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust
   law, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information
   security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing,
   sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, accessibility claims,
   securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services,
   escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In
   particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and
   intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and
   significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our
   company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and
   geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in
   complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our
   business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce,
   payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by
   the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty
   in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations
   increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and
   governmental actions alleging violations of those laws, rules and
   regulations.

   The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government
   investigations, and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be
   predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such
   investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because
   of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage,
   and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and
   regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that is
   subject to management's judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and
   regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial
   payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims
   or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our
   business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm,
   criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from
   offering certain products or services, requiring a change in our
   business practices in costly ways or development of non-infringing or
   otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences
   could materially and adversely affect our business.

   Certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with
   class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer
   class action litigation, but there can be no assurance that we will be
   successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, or the class
   action waiver provisions in them, in the future or in any given case.
   Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or
   indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses
   and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or
   limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or
   class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits,
   including additional consumer class action litigation, or materially
   impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action
   litigation.

   We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

   The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other
   tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there
   are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
   determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations,
   we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.
   Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and
   review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are
   currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by
   taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any
   such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and
   the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our
   financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in
   the periods for which such determination is made. While we have
   established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe
   are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to
   be insufficient.

   In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by
   earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses,
   in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than
   anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by
   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as
   a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or
   changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as
   certain discrete items.

   Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state
   legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization
   for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") and the EU, are
   increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory
   action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other
   legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax
   rate.

   We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and
   record-keeping obligations.

   A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign
   countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing
   reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or
   facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number
   of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and
   other intermediaries could be deemed

   27
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified
   our software to meet known requirements and expect further
   modifications will be required to comply with future requirements,
   which may change our customer experience and increase operational
   costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and
   record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary
   penalties and other sanctions, impact our ability to do business in
   certain jurisdictions, and harm our business.

   Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other
   strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could
   harm our business.

   Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other
   strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate
   strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array
   of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business
   strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and
   dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products,
   and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and
   commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve
   significant challenges and risks, including:

   o the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business
   partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and
   continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;

   o declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of
   companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes
   in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects,
   or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;

   o difficulty making strategic hires of new employees;

   o diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the
   business to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition,
   integration and administration;

   o the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting,
   management, information, compliance, human resource and other
   administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each
   acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy
   and costly process;

   o the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such
   integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties
   and expenditures that may arise as a result;

   o the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies
   appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to
   acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or
   whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal,
   regulatory and other standards;

   o potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and
   regulatory obligations associated with new products or entry into new
   markets;

   o risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;

   o risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effective
   managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic
   partnerships

   o lawsuits resulting from the transaction;

   o liability for activities of the acquired company before the
   acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation
   claims or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations,
   commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown
   liabilities;

   o the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;

   o the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information,
   which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or
   additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to
   additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance;
   and

   o our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating
   metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired
   businesses and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems,
   controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements
   or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.

   At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with
   respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of
   which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our
   financial condition and results of operations. There can be no
   assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and
   consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer
   than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these
   transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than
   anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect
   our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions
   may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our
   cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and
   amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of
   goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and
   dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.

   Joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser
   degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially
   increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks
   associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition,
   we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling
   shareholders, management or other persons or entities who

   28
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   control them may have business interests, strategies or goals that are
   inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or
   omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders,
   management or other persons or entities who control them may adversely
   affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory
   action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.

   We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates
   additional risk.

   We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the
   following:

   o networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link
   us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process
   transactions;

   o unaffiliated third-party lenders to make consumer and merchant loans
   originated in the U.S. for our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital
   products, respectively;

   o third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements
   processing;

   o third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and
   product development functions, which are critical to our operations;
   and

   o third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components and
   services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.

   Third parties that we rely on to process transactions may fail or
   refuse to process transactions adequately, and these and other third
   parties on whom we rely may breach their agreements with us, refuse to
   renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, take actions
   that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs
   or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive
   services. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other
   problems that prevent these third parties from providing services to us
   or our customers could harm our business. If our service providers do
   not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which
   could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation, and
   harm our business.

   Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations,
   disruptions or interruptions at, companies that we rely on to provide
   services to us or our customers could disrupt our operations and harm
   our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or
   gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without
   competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that
   third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will
   continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties
   were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable
   terms, including as a result of bankruptcy or other business
   interruption, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third
   parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at
   all.

   Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party
   developers, subject us to additional risks.

   We provide third-party developers with access to application
   programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools
   designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a
   particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that
   merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain
   applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at
   all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to
   curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our
   business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible
   that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development
   platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we
   may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our
   business.

   Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks.

   We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable
   merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to,
   or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment
   cards and codes using the mobile device's embedded camera, and which
   enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of
   sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa, MasterCard
   and Discover to further expand our relationship with these companies in
   a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to
   choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies' credit and
   debit cards. As part of those agreements, we will gain access to each
   of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store
   point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the
   number of point of sale transactions that we process. As we continue to
   expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale,
   we will face additional risks, including:

   o increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the
   reliability and availability of our systems and services and
   correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to
   meet;

   o significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly
   from established payment card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and
   American Express, many of which have substantially greater resources
   than we do;

   29
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   o increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are
   less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and
   associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at
   the point of sale;

   o exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware
   devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction
   or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial
   liability and require product recalls or other actions;

   o exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;

   o increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store
   payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of
   sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad
   providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store
   transactions; and

   o lower operating income than our other payment solutions.

   Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including
   driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point
   of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed.

   Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for
   our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,
   and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our
   business. The loss of key personnel could harm our business.

   Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services
   of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled
   employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such
   personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the
   San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located
   and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to
   successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key
   personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the
   technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the
   value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their
   employment, and fluctuations in our stock price, or a perception that
   the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more
   slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may
   make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We
   are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive
   domestic immigration laws or policies. In addition, we do not have
   long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do
   not maintain any "key person" life insurance policies. The loss of the
   services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract
   highly qualified key personnel, could harm our business.

   We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated
   through our products and services.

   Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating
   to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging
   defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence,
   copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws
   relating to the liability of companies providing online services for
   information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent
   challenges both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We are also
   subject to potential liability to third parties for the
   customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in
   jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled.
   If we become liable for information provided by our customers and
   carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and
   we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to
   this liability, including expending substantial resources or
   discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm
   our business.

   Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent
   Publicly Traded Company

   If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does
   not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S.
   federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the
   Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders
   could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain
   circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material
   taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters
   agreement.

   On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company
   through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% our outstanding
   common stock to eBay's stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the
   "separation" or the "distribution"). eBay received an opinion from its
   outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution,
   together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is
   generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections
   368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied
   on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as
   certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and of us,
   including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of
   us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were,
   or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our
   respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of
   counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be
   jeopardized.

   30
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that
   the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be
   treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of
   these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such
   opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS
   disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of
   counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no
   assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in
   the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the
   separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.

   If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed
   to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections
   368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize
   taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable
   sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal
   common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had
   received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such
   shares and we could incur significant liabilities.

   We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising
   transactions for a period of time following the separation. In
   addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting
   from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions.

   To preserve the tax-free treatment to eBay of the separation and the
   distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with
   eBay, for a period of time following the distribution, we are generally
   prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution
   and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is
   generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections
   368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. These restrictions may limit our
   ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions
   that we or our stockholders consider desirable or may prevent us from
   engaging in certain capital-raising transactions.

   We have limited history of operating as an independent, publicly traded
   company in our current form, and our historical financial information
   is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have
   achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a
   reliable indicator of our future results.

   The consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of
   this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived in part from the
   consolidated financial statements and accounting records of eBay and do
   not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations,
   or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, independent,
   publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we
   will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors
   described below:

   o Prior to the separation, our business was operated by eBay as part of
   its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent
   company. eBay or its affiliates performed various corporate functions
   for us, such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, tax, auditing,
   human resources, certain compliance functions, and public affairs. Our
   historical financial results prior to separation reflect allocations of
   corporate expenses from eBay for such functions, which are likely to be
   less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we
   operated as a separate publicly traded company. In addition, we may
   need to significantly increase our investment in certain of these
   functions to ensure appropriate levels of administrative, legal and
   regulatory compliance.

   o Prior to the separation, our business was integrated with the other
   businesses of eBay. Historically, we shared economies of scope and
   scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer
   relationships. Although we have entered into arm's length agreements
   with eBay, including the operating agreement, these arrangements may
   not retain or fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of
   being integrated with eBay and may result in our paying higher charges
   than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect
   on our results of operations and financial condition.

   o As a part of eBay, we benefited from, among other things, the
   acquisition of new customers from eBay, capital to fund acquisitions,
   investments and credit, and data from eBay that helped us to manage
   risks and maintain a low loss rate. In addition, being a part of eBay
   enabled us to leverage eBay's technology capabilities, data, commerce
   platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants
   worldwide. The loss of these synergies and benefits could adversely
   affect our results of operations and financial condition.

   o Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our
   general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital
   expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide
   cash management policies of eBay. We may need to obtain additional
   financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of
   debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other
   arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.

   o The cost of capital for our business may be higher than eBay's cost
   of capital prior to the separation.

   We may continue to experience significant changes in our cost
   structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result
   of operating as an independent company separate from eBay. For
   additional information, please see "Management's

   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
   notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   eBay remains a significant source of our revenues.

   We continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating
   income from eBay. Our relationship with eBay is governed in part by an
   operating agreement that was entered into at separation and has a term
   of five years. When our operating agreement with eBay expires, or if it
   is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant
   change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a
   merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management
   or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different
   provider of payment services or offers eBay customers more payment
   options, our business could be materially harmed.

   eBay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as
   part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and
   services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.

   In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and
   distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements,
   including an operating agreement, colocation services agreements,
   transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an employee
   matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data
   sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation
   agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement,
   and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the
   allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing)
   between the companies following the separation for those respective
   areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities
   and obligations. The operating agreement, the colocation services
   agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial
   relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing,
   credit, information technology infrastructure and data sharing. The
   transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain
   services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited
   period of time after the separation. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy
   its performance and payment obligations under these agreements,
   including its respective indemnification obligations, we could incur
   operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial
   indemnification or other payments to eBay. If we do not have in place
   our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with
   other providers of these services once these transaction agreements
   expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business
   effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be
   adversely affected.

   After the separation, certain of our directors may have actual or
   potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing
   positions at eBay.

   Because of their current or former positions with eBay, certain of our
   directors own eBay common stock and equity awards. Following the
   separation, even though our board of directors consists of a majority
   of directors who are independent, some of our directors continue to
   have a financial interest in eBay common stock and equity awards. In
   addition, one of our directors continues to serve on the eBay board of
   directors. Continuing ownership of eBay common stock and equity awards
   or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to
   create, potential conflicts of interest if we and eBay were to have
   disagreements about the agreements between us or face decisions that
   could have different implications for us and eBay.

   Risks Related to Our Common Stock

   The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to
   fluctuate significantly.

   The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to
   fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may
   be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:

   o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

   o changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and
   recommendations by securities analysts;

   o changes in our capital structure;

   o speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment
   community;

   o the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;

   o changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we
   operate; and

   o market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries
   of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.

   Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the
   state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in
   the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the
   District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types
   of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders,
   which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and
   officers.

   Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that
   unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the
   State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of
   Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of
   Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative
   action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a
   claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or
   officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim
   against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any
   provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") or our
   amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any
   action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers
   governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum
   provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in
   a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes
   with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such
   lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a
   court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision
   inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the
   specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could
   incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other
   jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial
   condition or results of operations.

   Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our
   company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.

   Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of
   deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by
   making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and
   by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of
   directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions
   include, among others:

   o rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate
   directors for election at stockholder meetings;

   o the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at
   stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group
   owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;

   o the right of our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the
   voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without
   stockholder approval; and

   o the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies
   on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the
   size of our board of directors;

   o the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and

   o the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.

   We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL,
   which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that
   acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15%
   of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not
   engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by
   merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a
   three-year period following the date on which that person or its
   affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's
   outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors
   Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold
   instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could
   delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.

   Certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement
   between eBay Inc. and certain entities under the control of Carl C.
   Icahn. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from
   takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may
   be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent
   an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the
   best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also
   prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent
   directors.

   In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock (including
   preferred stock) could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the
   Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e), see "Material U.S. Federal
   Income Tax Consequences" in our registration statement on Form 10, as
   amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the
   tax matters agreement, in such circumstances, we would be required to
   indemnify eBay for any resulting taxes, which could materially and
   adversely affect us. Moreover, this indemnity obligation might
   discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders
   may consider favorable. Please refer to "Certain Relationships and
   Related Person Transactions" and "Description of PayPal's Capital
   Stock" in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with
   the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed description
   of these agreements and provisions.

   As of February 2, 2017, there were approximately 3,932 holders of
   record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is
   significantly greater than this number of record holders, and includes
   stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in
   street name by brokers and other nominees.

   Dividend Policy

   We have never paid any cash dividends and we currently do not
   anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

   Stock Repurchase Activity

   We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2015. In
   January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
   program that provides for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our
   common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This
   stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution
   from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
   and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases
   of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share
   repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open
   market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or
   other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
   appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other
   financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to
   market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or
   when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our
   stock repurchase program at any time without notice.

   The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during
   the three months ended December 31, 2016 is summarized as follows:

   ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements
   within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
   Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including
   statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as
   those relating to future business, future results of operations or
   financial condition, new or planned features or services, or management
   strategies). You can identify these forward-looking statements by words
   such as "may," "will," "would," "should," "could," "expect,"
   "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan" and other similar
   expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and

   others, those discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial
   statements, related notes, and the other information appearing
   elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the SEC. We do not
   intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our

   actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and
   uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on

   Separation from eBay Inc.

   On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. ("eBay") announced its intent to
   separate its payments business into an independent, publicly traded
   company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay
   incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal Holdings") which is now the
   parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the
   assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. In June 2015, the
   board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the "separation")
   of eBay's payments business through the distribution (the
   "distribution") of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal
   Holdings to eBay's stockholders. PayPal Holdings' registration
   statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S.
   Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015
   (the "distribution date"), PayPal Holdings became an independent
   publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of
   100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay
   stockholders. Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of
   business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common
   stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date.
   Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock were
   distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings'
   common stock began "regular way" trading under the ticker symbol "PYPL"
   on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.

   Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the
   assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to
   PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the
   "capitalization"). The consolidated financial statements prior to the
   capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived
   from eBay's consolidated financial statements and accounting records.
   The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position,
   results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our
   business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization.
   Following the capitalization, our consolidated financial statements
   include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned
   subsidiaries. The consolidated financial position, results of
   operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the
   separation may not be indicative of what our financial position,
   results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate
   stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they
   indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and
   cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see "Note
   1--Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our
   consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K.

   Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires,
   references to "we," "our," "us," "the Company" and "PayPal" refer to
   PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of
   information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation, the
   consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including
   PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that had been
   historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically
   identifiable and attributable to the payments business.

   Business Environment

   We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that
   enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and
   merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services,
   as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people,
   not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for
   consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the
   world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined
   payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree,
   Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments
   Platform.

   37
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment
   characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the
   payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened
   as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as
   countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and
   consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are
   subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable
   to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and
   mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and
   regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws
   and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to
   non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their
   interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations
   applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business,
   results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor
   these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who
   depend on us.

   The United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a
   majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU)
   ("Brexit"). The outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global
   stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Brexit
   could adversely affect the U.K., European and worldwide economic and
   market conditions and could contribute to instability in regional or
   global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in
   the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign exchange
   exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from
   foreign currency rate movements. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, net revenues
   generated from our U.K. operations constituted 12%, 13% and 14%,
   respectively, of total net revenues. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, net
   revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted
   approximately 20% of total net revenues. For additional information on
   how Brexit could affect our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under
   the caption--"The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union
   could adversely affect us."

   Information security risks for global payments and technology companies
   have significantly increased in recent years. Although we are not aware
   of any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information
   security breaches on our Payments Platform, there can be no assurance
   that we are immune to these risks and will not suffer such losses in
   the future. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the caption--"Our
   business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches."

   distribution date.

   ** Not Meaningful

   Net revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 17%, in 2016 and $1.2 billion,
   or 15%, in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by growth in TPV (as
   defined below under "Net Revenues") of 26% in 2016 and 20% in 2015. Net
   revenues from Xoom (acquired in November 2015) contributed two
   percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015
   growth rate.

   Total operating expenses increased $1.5 billion, or 19%, in 2016 and $1
   billion or 15% in 2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an
   increase in transaction expense and transaction and loan losses and
   higher other operating expenses incurred to

   Table of Contents

   operate as an independent public company (primarily in customer support
   and operations, general and administrative, and depreciation and
   amortization), partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expense.
   The increase in total operating expense in 2015 was primarily due to an
   increase in transaction expense, transaction and loan losses, general
   and administrative, and customer support and operations expense. Xoom
   operating expenses contributed three percentage points to the 2016
   growth rate and one percentage point to the 2015 growth rate.

   Operating income increased $125 million, or 9%, in 2016 and $193
   million, or 15% in 2015. Operating income increased in 2016 and 2015
   primarily due to the increase in net revenues and total operating
   expenses increasing less compared to the increase in net revenues from
   operating efficiencies. Xoom had a four percentage points negative
   impact to 2016 growth rates and a one percentage point negative impact
   to 2015 growth rates. Our operating margin was 15%, 16% and 16% in
   2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating margin decreased in 2016
   primarily due to growth in our transaction expense and transaction and
   loan losses which together increased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015.
   Operating margin was flat in 2015 compared to 2014.



   Net income increased by $173 million, or 14%, in 2016 and $809 million,
   or 193%, in 2015. The increase in net income in 2016 was attributable
   to an increase in operating income of $125 million, a decrease in
   income tax expense of $30 million and an increase in other income
   (expense), net of $18 million. The increase in net income in 2015 was
   attributable to an increase in operating income of $193 million and a
   decrease in income tax expense of $582 million primarily resulting from
   the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to
   undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013
   and prior years.

   Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

   We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in
   foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk
   which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or
   weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we
   conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our
   net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into
   the U.S. dollar. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately
   47%, 50% and 52% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside
   of the United States, respectively. During each of these periods, the
   United Kingdom ("U.K.") was the only country, other than the United
   States, where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in. In
   2016, 2015 and 2014, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the
   U.K.) constituted approximately 20%

   39
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   of total net revenues. Because we have generated substantial net
   revenues internationally in recent periods, including during the
   periods presented, we are subject to the risks of doing business in
   countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under "Item 1A. Risk
   Factors--Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of
   Operations and Financial Condition."

   We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on
   our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied
   to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in
   foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a
   foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we
   designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow
   hedges to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency
   exchange rate movements. However, it is impossible to predict or
   eliminate the effects of this exposure. Gains and losses from these
   foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of
   transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions
   impact earnings.

   In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the year-over-year
   foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the
   following impact on our reported results:

   Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies,
   we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day, and
   may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency
   exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency
   exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency
   exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk
   on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
   functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign
   currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign
   currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange
   rate movements on our assets and liabilities.  The foreign currency
   gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in "Other
   income (expense), net," which is offset by the gains and losses on the
   foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange
   contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency
   exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.

   Financial Results

   Net revenues

   Revenue description

   We earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our
   Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are
   classified into the following two categories:



   o Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and
   merchants primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payments
   Volume ("TPV"), processed through our Payments Platform. We define TPV
   as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully
   completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions
   processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is
   directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable
   on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of
   payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our
   Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway
   and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled
   in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e.,
   transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different
   countries).

   o Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from
   interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable
   portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of
   participation interests in certain consumer loans

   40
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   receivable, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned
   on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our
   Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and
   merchants.

   Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:



   o The mix of merchants, products and services;

   o The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;

   o Geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and

   o The amount of PayPal Credit loans receivable outstanding with
   consumers and merchants.

   Transaction revenues

   Transaction revenues increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2016
   compared to 2015, and by $1.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015 compared to
   2014. Xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to
   the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015 growth rate. The
   increase in transaction revenues in 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to
   the growth in TPV and in the number of payment transactions, both of
   which were due primarily to increased engagement from our customers
   (measured by payment transactions per active account) and the increase
   in our active customer accounts. Net gains from our foreign currency
   exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in
   2016 were $119 million, compared to $182 million in 2015. Refer to
   "Note 8--Derivative Instruments" to our consolidated financial
   statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for

   program.

   ** Not meaningful

   The percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the
   percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2016 due primarily
   to a higher portion of person-to-person ("P2P") transactions (including
   our Venmo products) for which we earn

   41
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   lower rates, and a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants
   who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume. The
   percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage
   growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2015 due to a higher portion
   of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on
   higher transaction volume and a lower mix of cross-border transactions.
   Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues than
   similar transactions that take place within a single country or market.
   The percent of TPV generated by large merchants increased in 2016 and
   2015. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our
   customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2016 or 2015.

   Other value added services

   Net revenues from other value added services increased by $232 million,
   or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and by $202 million, or 22%, in 2015
   compared to 2014. Growth in net revenues from other value-added
   services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on
   our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. The total consumer and
   merchant loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and
   December 31, 2015 was $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively,
   reflecting a year over year increase of 29%. The increase in net
   revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to
   interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from
   consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products, revenue
   share earned under our credit program agreement with Synchrony
   Financial, and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain
   consumer loans receivable that we purchased, as described further
   below.

   In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit
   program agreement with Synchrony Financial. As a result of the
   amendment, we recognized $78 million of additional revenue under the
   agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement,
   our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables
   relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program
   agreement with Synchrony Financial was terminated. We retain an option
   to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term.

   In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain
   investors under which we sold participation interests in certain
   consumer loans and interest receivable related to our PayPal Credit
   products with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. As a
   result of the arrangement, the impact to net revenues from other value
   added services during 2015 was a net decrease of $35 million compared
   to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and
   fees on the participation interests sold, partially offset by the gain
   recognized on the sale of the participation interest (inclusive of the
   gain of $26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately
   $708 million in certain consumer loans receivable) and servicing fees.

   Operating Expenses

   Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain
   operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better
   align our external and internal financial reporting. These
   classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information
   technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among
   customer support and operations expense, sales and marketing expense
   and product development expense. Our management no longer allocates
   these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or
   general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this
   allocation for external financial reporting purposes. As a result,
   starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were
   reported as part of general and administrative expenses. These changes
   have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for
   prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position
   or cash flows for any periods presented, and do not eliminate any of
   the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the
   separation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
   the current period presentation. See "Note 1--Overview and Summary of
   Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial
   statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
   additional information on the effects of the changes on the
   presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported
   consolidated statement of income. Growth rates presented below are
   calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts.

   Transaction expense

   Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to
   accept a customer's funding source of payment. These costs include fees
   paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to
   draw funds from a customer's credit or debit card, bank account or
   other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet.
   Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to
   enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to
   finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal
   Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources
   used by our consumers as our "funding mix." The cost of funding a
   transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the
   cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources
   such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the
   availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change
   in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate.
   For example, in connection with our customer choice initiatives, we
   expect that our transaction expense rate will increase. The cost of
   funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or
   country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower
   rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than
   in the U.S.

   Transaction expense increased $736 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to
   2015. The increases in transaction expense in 2016 was primarily
   attributable to an increase in TPV, which increased 26% in 2016.
   Transaction expense increased by $440 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared
   to 2014. The increase in transaction expense in 2015 was primarily
   attributable to an increase in TPV, offset by favorable foreign
   currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

   Our transaction expense rate in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due
   primarily to changes in funding mix. For the years ended December 31,
   2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal
   Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
   approximately 45%, 45%, and 48% of TPV, respectively, was generated
   outside of the U.S. Our transaction expense rate in 2015 increased
   compared to 2014 due to higher assessments charged by payments
   processors and other financial institutions partially offset by cost
   efficiencies from our Payments Platform and a more favorable funding
   mix. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio
   of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was not material
   for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

   Transaction and loan losses

   Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer
   protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the
   losses associated with our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. We
   expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many
   factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our
   customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the
   credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded
   with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to select
   merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered
   certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs
   offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs
   included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's
   customer protection programs that we administered and

   43
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   funded on behalf of eBay, which were included as a reduction of
   transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection
   losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the years ended
   December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $27 million and $43 million,
   respectively. Following the distribution, we no longer administer
   eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay
   associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases;
   instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer
   protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend
   to customers' eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred
   and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our
   customer protection programs following the distribution.

   The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended
   December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

   to 2014.

   Transaction losses increased by $144 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared
   to 2015 primarily attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss
   rate, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, in 2016 was flat
   compared to 2015. The growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher
   than the growth in TPV in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs
   in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the
   distribution. Transaction losses increased by $103 million, or 25%, in
   2015 compared to 2014 primarily attributable to higher TPV. Our
   transaction loss rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to lower
   recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on
   eligible eBay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance
   and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred.

   Loan losses increased $135 million, or 45%, in 2016 compared to 2015
   and increased $60 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The
   increase in loan losses in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the
   loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves
   recorded in the current period due to increases to forecasted principal
   balance delinquency rates. The total consumer loans receivable balance
   as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5.1 billion and $4.0 billion,
   respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 28%. The increase
   in loan losses in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the loans
   receivable balance year over year. The total consumer loans receivable
   balance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $4.0 billion and $3.7
   billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 8% in
   2015, including the sale of additional participation interests to
   certain investors in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in
   consumer loans receivables in 2016 and 2015 was due to the growth in
   the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers
   who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working
   capital advances to selected merchant sellers.

   We offer credit products to certain existing small and medium-sized
   merchants through our PayPal Working Capital product. The total PayPal
   Working Capital advances and fees receivable ("merchant receivables")
   outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $558
   million and $421 million, respectively, reflecting a year over year
   increase of 33% due to the increase in the availability of our credit
   products domestically and internationally. To assess a merchant seeking
   a PayPal Working Capital advance, we use, among other indicators, a
   risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to as our
   PayPal Working Capital Risk Model ("PRM"), as a credit quality
   indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the principal
   balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance. The PRM
   uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to
   repay a working capital advance. Primary drivers of the model include
   the merchant's annual payment volume and payment processing history
   with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital
   product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score
   within the range of 350 to 750. We generally expect that merchants to
   which we extend a working capital advance will have PRM scores greater
   than 525. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to
   pose less credit risk. We assess a participating merchant's PRM score
   on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
   weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital
   balances outstanding was 625 and 630, respectively.

   The determination of the number of days our merchant receivables are
   outstanding is based on the current expected repayment period of the
   advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment
   period. We generally calculate the repayment rate based on the
   merchant's estimated future payment volume so that repayment of the
   advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from
   the date of the advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the
   repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As
   such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment
   processing volumes. We monitor receivables with repayment periods
   greater than the original expected repayment period. In the second
   quarter of 2016, we refined our estimate of the original expected
   repayment period to take into account the variability in repayment
   patterns. Prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this
   change.

   The following table provides information regarding the credit quality
   of our merchant receivables:

   ^(1) Amounts in the prior periods were updated to reflect changes in
   our estimate of the original expected repayment period.

   The changes in percentage of merchant receivables past their expected
   repayment period at December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 were due
   primarily to the increase in longer duration merchant loans in 2016
   compared to the prior year, which increased the seasonality of
   repayments trends.  Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of
   our PayPal Credit products for the periods presented did not have a
   material impact on our loans.

   Customer support and operations

   Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to
   provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and
   other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform,
   costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our
   merchants and consumers and other costs incurred in our operations
   centers. Customer support and operations costs increased $157 million,
   or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and $119 million, or 12%, in 2015
   compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase
   in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in
   our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions
   occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2015 was
   predominantly related to an increase in headcount to service the growth
   in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions
   occurring on our Payments Platform and an increase in expenses to
   operate as an independent public company offset in part by favorable
   foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S.
   dollar.

   Sales and marketing

   Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition,
   business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee
   compensation and contractor costs to support these programs. Sales and
   marketing expenses increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to
   2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend
   related to Xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global
   brand recognition. Sales and marketing expense decreased by $17
   million, or 2%, in

   45
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to a
   decrease in employee and contractor related expenses and favorable
   foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S.
   dollar, offset in part by higher marketing spend.

   Product development

   Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation
   and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the
   development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement
   of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software
   and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of
   developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization
   expense.

   Product development expenses increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016
   compared to 2015 and increased $45 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to
   2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee
   related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in
   contractor related expenses. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to
   investments in our Payments Platform, creating new mobile experiences
   for our customers and supporting our strategic initiatives, partially
   offset by a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses.

   General and Administrative

   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred
   to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources,
   finance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses,
   including those related to ongoing legal proceedings, case settlements
   and judgments, and regulatory proceedings and fines, may fluctuate
   substantially from period to period.

   For periods prior to the separation, our consolidated financial
   statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and
   information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments
   segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate
   functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and
   finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock-based
   compensation. The expenses that were incurred by eBay have been
   allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable,
   with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount,
   or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of
   expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have
   been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the
   periods presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the
   expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or
   lower. In the periods presented, a significant portion of expenses
   associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated
   financial statements are included in general and administrative
   expenses.

   General and administrative expenses increased $155 million, or 18%, in
   2016 compared to 2015 and increased $140 million, or 19%, in 2015
   compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase
   in employee expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate
   as an independent public company and continued investments in
   compliance programs. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to an
   increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public
   company and an increase in expenses associated with professional
   services, including contractor related expenses, and regulatory
   matters. In 2015, $121 million of corporate costs and expenses
   allocated to us by eBay were included in general and administrative
   expenses compared to $207 million in 2014, representing a decrease of
   $86 million, or 42%, compared to 2014.

   Depreciation and Amortization

   The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses
   include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the
   amortization of capitalized software and website development costs,
   amortization of equipment used to deliver our services and the
   amortization of acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and
   amortization expenses increased $116 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared
   to 2015 and increased $92 million, or 18%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
   The increases in 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to additional
   depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology
   platform and in 2015, an increase in capital expenditures to operate as
   an independent public company. Amortization expense for intangible
   assets was $150 million, $93 million and $84 million in the years ended
   December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in
   amortization of intangibles in 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to our
   acquisitions.

   Restructuring

   In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay's board of directors (the
   "eBay Board"), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic
   reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed
   by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product
   development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015.
   No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016 or 2014.

   Income Tax Expense

   Our effective tax rate was 14% in 2016, 17% in 2015, and 67% in 2014.
   The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to
   favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31,
   2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year ended
   December 31, 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015
   compared to 2014 was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of a U.S.
   deferred tax liability of approximately $650 million on $1.9 billion of
   undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries
   for 2013 and prior years. See "Note 16--Income Taxes" to the
   consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.

   Non-GAAP Financial Information

   Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a
   company's performance that excludes or includes amounts that are
   different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and
   presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
   in the United States ("GAAP"). Pursuant to the requirements of
   Regulation S-K, portions of this "Management's Discussion and Analysis
   of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" include a
   reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most
   directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of
   non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as
   a substitute for our related financial results prepared in accordance
   with GAAP.

   We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor's
   evaluation of our ongoing operating results and to facilitate
   meaningful comparison of our results between periods. Management uses
   these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our
   ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and
   in the calculation of performance-based compensation.

   We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net
   income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating
   margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and non-GAAP income tax expense:

   o Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes.
   This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive
   plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP
   measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management
   does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The
   related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the
   timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which
   management has limited to no control, and as such management does not
   believe it correlates to the operation of our business.

   o Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment
   of goodwill and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal
   of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired
   intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may
   incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the
   acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these
   amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because
   management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing
   operating results.

   o Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation
   of our business from eBay into a separate, independent publicly traded
   company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal
   fees, employee retention payments and other expenses incurred to
   complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does
   not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.

   o Restructuring. These consist of significant expenses for employee
   severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring
   charges primarily because management does not believe they are
   reflective of ongoing operating results.

   o Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not
   indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains,
   losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated
   events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past
   and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these
   amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does not believe
   they are indicative of our ongoing operating results.

   o Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This amount is used to present
   stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an
   after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net
   income.

   ^1 On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record
   as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of
   PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the
   record date. Basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended
   December 31, 2014 was calculated using the number of common shares
   distributed on the distribution date.

   ^2 The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic
   and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was
   based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for
   the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of
   common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the
   distribution date.

   In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free
   cash flow to assess our operating performance. Free cash flow
   represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of
   property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a key
   performance measure that provides useful information to management and
   investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the
   purchases of property and equipment and including investments in our
   Payments Platform, which can

   48
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make
   strategic acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders. A limitation
   of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance
   is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our
   cash balance for the period.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources

   We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global
   operations, including customer protection programs, our PayPal Credit
   products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential
   acquisitions, working capital and other cash needs. The following table
   summarizes the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances available
   as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

   ^(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $17 million and $26 million at
   December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and cost method
   investments of $50 million and $26 million as of December 31, 2016 and
   December 31, 2015, respectively.

   Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries
   (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to United States
   tax upon repatriation) were $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and
   $4.2 billion at December 31, 2015, or 78% and 74% of our total cash,
   cash equivalents and investments as of those dates, respectively.

   In the second quarter of 2015, we received a contribution of
   approximately $3.8 billion of cash from eBay, as well as a related
   estimated deferred tax liability of $236 million associated with
   foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested. In
   the fourth quarter of 2015, we reassessed the measurement of the
   deferred tax liability based on updated valuation information and
   reduced the deferred tax liability balance to $172 million as of
   December 31, 2015. The adjustment to the deferred tax liability was
   recorded as a contribution from eBay and resulted in an increase to net
   parent investment within stockholders' equity. This cash is being used
   for general corporate purposes in both our international and domestic
   operations.

   In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement
   ("Credit Agreement") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion,
   five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter
   of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with
   available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the
   amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding.
   Borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement are
   guaranteed by PayPal, Inc. (the "Guarantor"). We may also, subject to
   the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under
   the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million. Subject to
   specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries
   as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement provided that we and
   the Guarantor guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any
   such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016,
   no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed
   under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital
   expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

   Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the
   London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin (based on our
   public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or
   (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds
   effective rate or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt
   ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.625 percent. Subject to certain
   conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our
   subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and
   re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time
   during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will
   terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on
   July 17, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier,
   either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders
   (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or
   (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the
   agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary
   representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants,
   including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification
   provisions in favor of the banks. The negative

   49
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens,
   subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to
   meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated
   interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio,
   based on our public debt ratings.

   As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings or letters of credit were
   outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31,
   2016, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes
   permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to
   borrowing.

   We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for
   cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals
   from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash
   balances held within the financial institution ("Aggregate Cash
   Deposits"). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts
   exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The
   net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used
   by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net
   interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31,
   2016, we had a total of $2.0 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our
   $2.0 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial
   institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

   As of December 31, 2016, we were rated investment grade by Standard and
   Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that
   these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance,
   including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is
   to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change there are
   factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put
   on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it
   could increase our borrowing costs, including the interest rate on
   loans under our Credit Agreement.

   The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific
   to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be
   impacted by regional variations in the programs and modifications to
   the programs resulting from changes to regulatory requirements. For the
   periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included
   in this report, our transaction loss rates, calculated by dividing
   transaction loss by TPV, ranged between 0.17% and 0.18% of TPV.
   Historical trends may not be an indication of future results. In
   addition, prior to the distribution, we recovered certain amounts from
   eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay
   purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of
   protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs
   that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which are included
   as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Following the
   distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection
   programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with transaction
   losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each
   independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further,
   our customer protection programs extend to customers' eligible
   purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue
   to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection
   programs following the distribution.

   Growth in our portfolio of loan receivables originated through PayPal
   Credit products increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet
   those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue
   to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding of our
   credit portfolio, including, but not limited to, commercial banks,
   securitization markets, private equity firms and sovereign wealth
   funds. Consistent with this strategy, in March 2016, as approved by
   management and our Luxembourg banking subsidiary Supervisory Board and
   as permitted within regulations set forth by the Luxembourg Commission
   de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the "CSSF"), we designated $800
   million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking
   subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. These
   funds are classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated
   balance sheet and represent approximately 20% of European customer
   balances potentially available for corporate use by us at December 31,
   2016 as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the
   CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of
   customer balances to be used to extend credit to our European
   customers, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and
   anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the
   availability of our credit products with capital from external sources,
   although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in
   achieving that goal.

   In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
   program that provides for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our
   common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This
   stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution
   from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
   and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases
   of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share
   repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open
   market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or
   other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
   appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other
   financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to
   market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or
   when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our
   stock repurchase program at any time without notice. During the year
   ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $995 million of
   our common stock

   50
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016, a total of
   approximately $1.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of
   our common stock under our stock repurchase program.

   Our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely
   impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance,
   and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other
   factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing
   costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the
   legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See "Risk
   Factors--Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of
   Operations and Financial Condition" and "Note 12--Commitments and
   Contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements included
   elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion
   of these and other risks facing our business.

   We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale
   investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our
   expected access to capital markets, together with potential external
   funding through third-party sources, such as commercial banks, private
   equity firms, and sovereign wealth funds, will be sufficient to fund
   our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and PayPal
   Credit products for the foreseeable future.

   Cash Flows

   In March 2016, we designated $800 million of European customer balances
   held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit
   to our European customers. We have presented changes in funds
   receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing
   activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the
   nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts which includes
   purchases of investments, maturities and sales of investments and
   changes in funds receivable and customer accounts. We have elected to
   conform the prior period statement of cash flows to the current period
   presentation to enhance transparency and provide comparability. See
   "Note 1--Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to
   our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
   Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the
   changes on the presentation of our statement of cash flows to our
   previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows.

   Operating Activities

   Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for
   certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses
   recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual
   transaction losses paid, and changes in other assets and liabilities.
   Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and
   amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred tax expenses. The
   cash impact from actual transaction losses paid during a period are
   reflected as a negative impact to changes in other current and
   non-current assets in cash from operating activities. The expenses
   recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are
   estimates of probable incurred losses on our PayPal Credit products for
   which the receivable has not been charged off. Actual charge offs of
   receivables related to our PayPal Credit products are reflected as a
   reduction in changes in principal loans receivable impacting investing
   activities and thus have no impact on cash from operating activities.

   We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due
   primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and
   stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from
   stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to provision for transaction
   and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. The cash
   generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes
   in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for
   cash losses, net.

   We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2015 due
   primarily to operating income of approximately $1.5 billion.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and
   stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from
   stock-based compensation) were approximately $928 million during 2015.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses

   51
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   related to transaction and loan losses were approximately $809 million
   during 2015. The cash generated from operating activities was
   negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to
   actual transaction losses paid during the period. Additional uses of
   cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net
   cash outflows relating to settlement of eBay payables and receivables
   of approximately $96 million and increases in accounts receivable of
   approximately $22 million.

   We generated cash from operating activities of $2.2 billion in 2014 due
   primarily to operating income of approximately $1.3 billion.
   Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and
   stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from
   stock-based compensation) were approximately $774 million. Adjustments
   to non-cash expenses for transaction and loan losses were $646 million.
   The cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash
   primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net
   and changes in other working capital.

   Cash paid for income taxes in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $48 million, $216
   million and $47 million, respectively.

   Investing Activities

   The net cash used in investing activities of $5 billion in 2016 was due
   primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of $21.0
   billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of
   collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $1.5
   billion, purchases of property and equipment of $669 million and net
   increases in funds receivable from customers and customer accounts of
   $176 million, including the reclassification of $800 million of
   European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as
   cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were offset by
   maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion.

   The net cash used in investing activities of $8 billion in 2015 was due
   primarily to purchases of investments of $21.6 billion, acquisitions,
   net of cash acquired of $1.2 billion, increases in our loan receivable
   portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal Credit
   products of $819 million and purchases of property and equipment of
   $722 million. These net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities
   and sales of investments of $16.1 billion and net cash inflows relating
   to receivables from eBay of $575 million.

   The net cash used in investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2014 was
   due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of $8.7
   billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of
   collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $1
   billion, purchases of property and equipment of $492 million and net
   cash outflows relating to receivables from eBay of $362 million. These
   net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of
   investments of $7.8 billion.

   Financing Activities

   The net cash provided by financing activities of $2 billion in 2016 was
   due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to
   customers of $3 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995
   million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.



   The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.7 billion in 2015
   was due primarily to a contribution of approximately $3.9 billion of
   cash from eBay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to
   customers of $1.6 billion, offset in part by repayments of borrowings
   from eBay of $862 million.

   The net cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2014
   was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to
   customers of $1.3 billion, offset in part by repayments of borrowings
   from eBay.

   Free Cash Flow

   We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less
   purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in
   2016, an increase of $665 million from 2015. The increase in free cash
   flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from
   operating activities of $612 million and lower purchases of property
   and equipment of $53 million. Free cash flow generated during 2016 was
   used for funding our credit portfolio, repurchasing our common stock
   under our stock repurchase program, and general business purposes.

   Free cash flow was $1.8 billion in 2015, an increase of $96 million
   from 2014. The increase in free cash flow during the period was
   primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of
   $326 million, offset in part by higher purchases of property and
   equipment of $230 million. Free cash flow generated during 2015 was
   used towards our acquisitions completed in 2015, funding our credit
   portfolio and general business purposes.

   52
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial
   Information" for information on how we compute free cash flow and a
   reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

   Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash

   Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash and cash
   equivalents in 2016. The negative effect of currency exchange rates on
   cash and cash equivalents during 2015 and 2014 of $44 million and $26
   million, respectively, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
   against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet
   arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
   future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
   of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

   Future Liquidity and Obligations

   As of December 31, 2016, approximately $28.8 billion of unused credit
   was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $24.8
   billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2015. While this amount
   represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced,
   and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders
   will access their entire available credit at any given point in time.
   In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused
   credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered
   financial institution that is the issuer of PayPal Credit products
   based on, among other things, account usage and customer
   creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a
   PayPal Credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the
   chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds
   the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the
   merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the
   consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as
   a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan
   defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own
   each customer account, we own the related receivable (excluding
   participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing
   functions related to the account.

   We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that
   include future estimated payments for general operating purposes.
   Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions,
   fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual
   payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty
   regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table
   summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2016 that are expected to
   impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be
   able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment
   portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations.

   The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts
   presented in the above table are as follows:

   o Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for
   advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software
   applications, engineering development services, construction contracts)
   and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of
   business.

   o Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our
   non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities,

   53
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease
   arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual
   terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results
   under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount
   needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office
   facility early.

   As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of
   liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does
   not include $244 million of such non-current liabilities included in
   deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance
   sheet as of December 31, 2016.

   Seasonality

   The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to
   net revenues. No individual quarter in 2016, 2015 or 2014 accounted for
   more than 30% of annual net revenue.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

   The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
   assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect
   our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies
   and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods
   used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are
   applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates
   and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to
   be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting
   estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate
   or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
   judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of
   outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial
   condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection
   and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board
   of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent
   accounting pronouncements, are described in "Note 1--Overview and
   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated annual
   financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
   10-K.

   A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information
   is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides
   material information to investors. The amounts used to assess
   sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a
   general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do
   not represent management's predictions of variability. For all of these
   estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly
   as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

   Transaction and loan losses

   Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our
   customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses
   associated with our loans receivable balances. We expect our
   transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors,
   including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer
   protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit
   quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our
   PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to selected
   merchant sellers.

   We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from
   processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized
   credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of
   goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims,
   account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance,
   in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses
   in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored
   regularly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our
   claims processors and other actual data received. The allowances are
   based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including
   experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment
   patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.

   We also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents
   our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer
   loans receivable and merchant working capital advances. Increases to
   the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and
   loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation
   process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. For our
   consumer loans receivable, the allowance is primarily based on
   forecasted principal balance delinquency rates ("roll rates"). Roll
   rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate
   from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical
   experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies
   and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal
   amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency, from
   current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the
   principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be
   charged off. For merchant working capital advances, the allowance is
   primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.

   54
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due,
   for principal balances related to merchant working capital advances is
   based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed
   fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We calculate
   the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment
   volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically
   expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance.
   On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the
   actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment
   periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes.

   The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily
   determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates
   to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to
   project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are
   probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is
   primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.
   Increases to the allowance for interest receivable is reflected as a
   reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statement of income.
   Increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a
   reduction in deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheet.

   We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a
   customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date. We charge
   off the merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is 180
   days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has
   not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the
   receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the
   original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the
   merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts
   are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification from the
   bankruptcy courts. Loans receivable past the payment due date continue
   to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off, with the
   portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance
   classified as a reduction of revenue.

   Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently
   uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current
   estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts
   become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or
   recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem
   appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance
   sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2016,
   an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate
   would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately
   $109 million.

   Accounting for Income Taxes

   Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax
   planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in
   which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different
   interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing
   authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax
   expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating
   uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the
   balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is
   significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign
   earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our
   income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are
   indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is
   determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning our
   future operations. To the extent we do not intend to repatriate these
   earnings to fund U.S. operations, we do not provide for U.S. federal
   income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings.

   Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes
   payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of
   temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
   assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax
   credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future
   tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected
   taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable
   temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax
   planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates
   that are based on a number of factors, including our historical
   experience and short range and long-range business forecasts. To the
   extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a
   valuation allowance.

   We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with
   GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an
   uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax
   position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
   based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
   recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then
   measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50
   percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We
   report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from
   uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
   GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected
   ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in
   earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize
   interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
   income tax expense.

   We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions
   around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax
   position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally
   resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final

   55
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax
   position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate
   such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained
   in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related
   interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and
   circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the
   use of cash.

   Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2016, a
   one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have
   resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $16
   million.

   Loss Contingencies

   We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings and
   investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory
   oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each
   significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the
   potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding or potential regulatory
   violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably
   estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant
   judgment is required in both the determination of probability and
   whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are
   subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings,
   the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside
   legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters,
   accruals are based only on the best information available at the time.
   As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential
   liability related to pending claims, litigation or other violation and
   may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the
   legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we
   operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual
   outcomes.

   Revenue Recognition

   Application of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related
   to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make
   judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms
   and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to
   determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination
   of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an
   agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we
   provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require
   judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a
   reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these
   assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue
   recognized.

   Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

   The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset
   impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and
   assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business
   combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired,
   liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired
   business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between
   assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment
   testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
   assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group
   of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or
   group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to
   be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
   These valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which
   would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may
   occur.

   We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual
   basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under the Financial
   Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance, the evaluation of
   indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a
   qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the FASB
   guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these
   qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions,
   including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market
   conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors,
   company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors and our market
   capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more
   likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or
   indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying
   amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.

   Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the
   reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds
   the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or
   indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in
   the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting
   unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures:
   amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a
   current transaction between willing parties, using present value
   techniques of estimated future cash flows, or using valuation
   techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar
   performance measure.

   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

   Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on
   market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in
   market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
   and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the
   implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and
   foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market
   risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.

   Interest Rate Risk

   We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment
   portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the
   customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer
   accounts. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from
   changes in interest rates.

   As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 25% and
   24%, respectively, of our total cash and investment portfolio was held
   in cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying the customer
   balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts
   are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time
   deposits, and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. We
   classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based
   on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation
   under amounts due to customers. We seek to preserve principal while
   holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory
   requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions where we operate,
   equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer
   balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.

   In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $2 billion senior
   unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020. Borrowings under the
   revolving facility, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a
   result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the
   extent of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of
   December 31, 2016, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding
   under the Credit Agreement.

   Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers' spending levels
   and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us.
   Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by
   customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other
   consumer loan obligations, which may reduce our customers' ability to
   remain current on their obligations to us and therefore may lead to
   increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowances for loan and
   interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net
   earnings.

   A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a
   material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at December 31,
   2016 and December 31, 2015.

   Foreign Currency Risk

   We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in
   foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
   Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk
   which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business
   in various foreign currencies and have significant international
   revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international
   subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and
   for certain corporate services. Our cash flow, results of operations
   and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign
   exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and
   we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency
   fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net
   receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening
   of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of
   the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.

   We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to
   identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures
   and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our
   reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through
   foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange
   contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional
   details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see
   "Note 8--Derivative Instruments" to the consolidated financial
   statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   We use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted
   U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign
   currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not
   entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate
   movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for
   accounting purposes. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or
   loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
   comprehensive income ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into
   revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
   The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these
   contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings.

   57
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and
   determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange
   rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.
   If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2016 and
   December 31, 2015, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign
   currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been
   approximately $341 million and $321 million lower, respectively. If the
   U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2016 and December 31,
   2015, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency
   exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately
   $341 million and $321 million higher, respectively.

   We have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we
   use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency
   exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
   other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts
   are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not
   entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on
   our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on
   our assets and liabilities are recorded in "Other income (expense),
   net," which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency
   exchange contracts.

   Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have
   resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of
   approximately $160 million and $136 million at December 31, 2016 and
   December 31, 2015, respectively, without considering the offsetting
   effect of hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of
   December 31, 2016 would have positively impacted income before income
   taxes by approximately $128 million, resulting in a net negative impact
   of approximately $32 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in
   place as of December 31, 2015 would have positively impacted income
   before income taxes by approximately $133 million, resulting in a net
   negative impact of approximately $3 million. These reasonably possible
   adverse changes in currency exchange rates of 20% were applied to total
   monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
   the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet
   dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our
   income before income taxes as of these dates.

   Equity Price Risk

   As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our cost method
   investments totaled $50 million and $26 million, respectively, which
   represented less than 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio and
   were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held
   companies. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not hold any
   marketable equity instruments. We review our investments for impairment
   when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such
   assets below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis
   includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales
   and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other
   publicly available data.

   European Debt Exposures



   We actively monitor our exposure to the European markets, including the
   impact of sovereign debt issues associated with Cyprus, Greece,
   Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. As of December 31, 2016 and
   December 31, 2015, we did not have any direct investments in the
   sovereign debt of these countries or in debt securities issued by
   corporations or financial institutions organized in these countries. We
   maintain a small number of operating bank accounts with local and
   foreign banks in the aforementioned countries that have balances that
   we do not consider material.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

   To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc.

   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
   index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material
   respects, the financial position of PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its
   subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the
   results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
   years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with
   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
   America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
   listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in
   all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
   conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in
   our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
   effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
   2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
   Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
   the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible
   for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
   maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
   its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
   reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over
   Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
   express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
   statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over
   financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
   audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
   Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
   that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
   about whether the financial statements are free of material
   misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
   reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
   financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
   supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
   assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
   by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
   presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
   included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
   reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
   testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
   internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
   performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
   circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
   for our opinions.

   A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
   designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
   financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
   external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
   principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting
   includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
   maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
   fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
   company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
   recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
   accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
   receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
   accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
   company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
   timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
   the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
   statements.

   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
   reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
   any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
   risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
   conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
   procedures may deteriorate.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   Note 1--Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Overview and Organization

   PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our")
   was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading
   technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital
   and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Our
   vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that
   managing and moving money is a right for all people, not just the
   affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and
   merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world,
   anytime, on any platform and using any device. We provide safer and
   simpler ways for businesses of all sizes to accept payments from
   merchant websites, mobile devices and applications, and at offline
   retail locations through a wide range of payment solutions. We also
   facilitate person-to-person payments through PayPal, Venmo and Xoom.
   Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit,
   Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary
   Payments Platform. The terms "we," "our," "us," "the Company," and
   "PayPal" mean PayPal Holdings, Inc. and, unless otherwise expressly
   stated or the context requires, its subsidiaries.

   We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment
   characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the
   payments industry. Government regulation impacts key aspects of our
   business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments
   industry in the markets in which we operate. Non-compliance with laws
   and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to
   non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their
   interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations
   applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business,
   results of operations and financial condition.

   Significant Accounting Policies

   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

   On July 17, 2015 (the "distribution date"), PayPal became an
   independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution
   by eBay Inc. ("eBay") of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal
   to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the "separation" or the
   "distribution"). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of
   business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for
   every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately
   1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17,
   2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal's common stock began "regular way"
   trading under the ticker symbol "PYPL" on The NASDAQ Stock Market on
   July 20, 2015.

   Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the
   assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to
   PayPal, which was completed in June 2015 (the "capitalization"). The
   consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization were
   prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay's
   consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The
   consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position,
   results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our
   business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization.
   Following the capitalization, the consolidated financial statements
   include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
   All periods presented have been accounted for in conformity with U.S.
   generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

   For periods prior to the capitalization, the consolidated financial
   statements include expenses associated with real estate and information
   technology that were previously allocated to the payments business of
   eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions,
   including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These
   expenses also include allocations related to stock-based compensation.
   The expenses that were incurred by eBay were allocated to us based on
   direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder
   allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other
   systematic measure. We consider the expense allocation methodology and
   results to be reasonable for all periods presented. The consolidated
   financial statements also include certain assets and liabilities that
   were historically held at the eBay corporate level, but which are
   specifically identifiable and attributable to us. The consolidated
   financial position, results of operations and cash flows of PayPal
   prior to the distribution may not be indicative of our results had we
   been a separate stand-alone entity throughout the periods presented,
   nor are the results stated herein indicative of what the Company's
   financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the
   future. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been
   eliminated. Transactions between the Company and eBay are included in
   these consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

   Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain
   operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better
   align our external and internal financial reporting. These
   classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information

   68
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among
   customer support and operations expense, sales and marketing expense
   and product development expense. As of the first quarter of 2016, our
   management did not allocate these operating expenses for internal
   financial reporting and general management of the business and has
   therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting
   purposes. As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016, these
   operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative
   expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported
   consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating
   expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods presented,
   and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any
   periods prior to the separation. Prior period amounts have been
   reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

   The following tables presents the effects of the changes on the
   presentation of operating expenses to the previously reported
   consolidated statement of income:

   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
   financial statements of PayPal and our wholly and majority-owned
   subsidiaries. Investments in entities where we hold less than a 20%
   ownership interest are accounted for using the cost method of
   accounting, and our share of the investees' results of operations is
   included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement
   of income to the extent dividends are received. Our investment balance
   is included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet.

   In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements
   reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, which are necessary for fair presentation of the
   consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We have
   evaluated all subsequent events through the date the financial
   statements were issued. Certain amounts for prior years have been
   reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of
   and for the year ended December 31, 2016.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   Use of estimates

   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
   GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
   the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
   contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
   financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses,
   including allocations from eBay, during the reporting period. On an
   ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to
   those related to provisions for transaction and loan losses, legal
   contingencies, income taxes, revenue recognition, and the valuation of
   goodwill and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical
   experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be
   reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from
   these estimates.

   Cash and cash equivalents

   Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments
   with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are
   composed of primarily of bank deposits, government and agency
   securities and commercial paper.

   Investments

   Short-term investments, which include time deposits, government and
   agency securities and corporate debt securities with original
   maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when
   purchased, are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at
   fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains
   and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of
   other comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax
   provisions or benefits.



   Long-term investments include corporate debt securities, government and
   agency securities and cost method investments with maturities exceeding
   one year. Debt securities, government and agency securities are
   classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using
   the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are
   excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other
   comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or
   benefits.

   We elect to account for foreign currency denominated available-for-sale
   investments underlying funds receivable and customer accounts,
   short-term investments and long-term investments under the fair value
   option as further discussed in "Note 5--Funds Receivable and Customer
   Accounts" and "Note 6--Investments." The changes in fair value related
   to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are
   included in earnings as a component of other income (expense), net.

   Our cost method investments consist of investments in privately held
   companies where we do not have the ability to exercise significant
   influence, or have control over the investee. These investments are
   recorded at cost and are subject to periodic tests for
   other-than-temporary impairment.

   We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our
   investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market
   conditions. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we
   will write down the investment to its fair value and record the
   corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our
   consolidated statements of income. With respect to our debt securities,
   this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the
   decline in value, our intent to sell the security, whether it is more
   likely than not we will be required to sell the security before
   recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we expect to recover
   the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, whether a
   credit loss exists).

   Loans and interest receivable, net

   Loans and interest receivable, net represents consumer receivables
   originated under PayPal Credit consumer accounts and working capital
   advances to select small and medium-sized PayPal merchants through our
   PayPal Working Capital product. In the U.S., we work with independent
   chartered financial institutions that extend credit to the consumer or
   merchant using our PayPal credit products.

   For our consumer credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit
   through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary. For our merchant credit
   products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances in the
   U.K. through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and we extend working
   capital advances in Australia through an Australian subsidiary. We
   purchase the related receivables extended by the independent chartered
   financial institution and are responsible for servicing functions
   related to all of our credit products. As part of the arrangement with
   the independent chartered financial institution in the U.S. that we
   work with, we sell back a participation interest in the pool of
   consumer receivables outstanding under PayPal Credit consumer accounts.
   For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation
   interest are not material as the carrying amount of the participation
   interest sold

   70
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   approximates the fair value at time of transfer. However, we have a
   separate arrangement with certain investors under which we sell to
   these investors a participation interest in certain consumer loans
   receivable that we purchased, where the consideration received exceeds
   the carrying amount of the participation interest sold which results in
   a gain reflected as net revenues in our consolidated financial
   statements. See "Note 10--Loans and Interest Receivable, net" for
   additional information related to this arrangement. We apply a
   control-oriented, financial-components approach and account for the
   asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the
   participation interest for which control has been surrendered.

   Loans, advances and interest and fees receivable are reported at their
   outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold
   and pro-rata allowances, including unamortized deferred origination
   costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. We maintain the
   servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer receivables
   outstanding and receive a fee approximating the fair value for
   servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.

   The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly
   bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms
   also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain
   circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual
   loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these
   balances.



   Allowance for loans and interest receivable

   The allowance for loans and interest receivable represents management's
   estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in our PayPal Credit
   portfolio of receivables. Increases to the allowance for loans
   receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our
   consolidated financial statements. The evaluation process to assess the
   adequacy of allowances is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.
   For our consumer loans receivable, the allowance is primarily based on
   forecasted principal balance delinquency rates ("roll rates"). Roll
   rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate
   from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical
   experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies
   and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to principal amount
   of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current
   to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the
   principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be
   charged off. For merchant working capital advances, the allowance is
   primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.

   The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due,
   for principal balances related to merchant working capital advances is
   based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed
   fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We calculate
   the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment
   volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically
   expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance.
   On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the
   actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment
   periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. See
   "Note 10--Loans and Interest Receivable, Net" for additional
   information on the delinquency status of our PayPal Credit portfolio of
   receivables.

   The allowance for loss against interest receivable is primarily
   determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates
   to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to
   project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are
   probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is
   primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates and
   recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.
   Increases to the allowance for interest receivable is reflected as a
   reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statement of income.
   Increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a
   reduction in deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheet.

   We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a
   customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date. We charge
   off the merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is 180
   days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has
   not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the
   receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the
   original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the
   merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days.

   Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving
   notification from the bankruptcy courts. Consumer loans receivable past
   the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as
   they are charged off. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a
   reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.

   Customer accounts

   We hold all customer balances (both in the U.S. and internationally) as
   direct claims against us which are reflected on our consolidated
   balance sheet as a liability classified as amounts due to customers.
   Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates require us to hold eligible
   liquid assets, as defined by the regulators in these jurisdictions,
   equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer
   balances. Therefore, we use the assets underlying the customer balances
   to meet these regulatory requirements and separately classify the
   assets as customer accounts in our consolidated balance sheet. We
   classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based
   on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation
   under amounts due to customers.

   In March 2016, as approved by management and our Luxembourg banking
   subsidiary Supervisory Board and as permitted within regulations set
   forth by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier
   (the "CSSF"), we designated $800 million of European customer balances
   held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit
   to our European customers. This is consistent with our strategy of
   diversifying funding sources for our credit business and does not
   represent a change in our credit business development strategy or risk
   appetite. These funds are classified as cash and cash equivalents in
   our consolidated balance sheet and represent approximately 20% of
   European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by
   the Company at December 31, 2016 as determined by applying financial
   regulations maintained by the CSSF. The remaining assets underlying the
   customer balances remain separately classified as customer accounts in
   our consolidated balance sheet. We do not commingle these customer
   accounts with corporate funds and maintain these assets separately in
   interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits,
   corporate debt securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency
   securities. See "Note 5--Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts" for
   additional information related to customer accounts. Due to the above
   approved plan, we have presented changes in funds receivable and
   customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our
   consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the
   activity underlying our customer accounts. We have elected to conform
   the prior year statement of cash flows to the current period
   presentation to provide comparability.

   The following table presents the effects of the changes on the
   presentation of the statement of cash flows to the previously reported
   cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing
   activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years
   ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. These changes have no impact on the
   previously reported total net cash flows:

   Funds receivable and funds payable

   Funds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to
   initiate collection from and clear transactions through external
   payment networks. When customers fund their account using their bank
   account or a credit card or debit card, or withdraw funds from their
   PayPal account to their bank account or through a debit card
   transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or
   settled, usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions and
   generally up to five business days for international transactions.

   Allowance for negative customer balances

   Negative customer balances occur primarily when there are insufficient
   funds in a customer's PayPal account to cover charges applied for
   Automated Clearing House ("ACH") returns, debit card transactions,
   chargebacks, nondelivery or unsatisfactory delivery of goods or
   services. Negative balances can be cured by the customer by adding
   funds to the account, receiving payments, or through back-up funding
   sources. We also utilize third-party collection agents. For negative
   customer balances that are not expected to be cured or otherwise
   collected, we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The
   allowance is estimated based on known facts and circumstances, internal
   factors including our experience with similar cases, and historical
   trends involving collection and write-off patterns. Negative customer
   balances are included in other current assets, net of the allowance.
   Adjustments to the allowance for negative customer balances are
   recorded as a component of transaction and loan loss. The allowance for
   negative customer balances was $144 million and $119 million at
   December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   Property and equipment

   Property and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment,
   software and website development costs, land and buildings and
   leasehold improvements. Property and equipment are stated at historical
   cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are
   computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
   of the assets; generally, one to three years for computer equipment and
   software, including capitalized software and website development costs,
   three years for furniture and fixtures, up to thirty years for
   buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of five years or
   the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.

   Goodwill and intangible assets

   Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis.
   Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first
   performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more
   likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
   its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative
   assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its
   fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of
   the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the
   reporting unit is estimated using income and market approaches. The
   discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses
   expected future operating results and a market participant discount
   rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and other
   relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly
   traded entities or merger and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics
   to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of
   the reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes
   in the discount rate or market pricing metrics, may cause a future
   impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our
   annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2016 and 2015. We
   determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our
   reporting unit was required. As of December 31, 2016, we determined
   that no events or circumstances from August 31, 2016 through
   December 31, 2016 indicated that a further assessment was necessary.

   Intangible assets consist of customer-related intangible assets,
   marketing related intangibles, developed technologies and other
   intangible assets including purchased partner relationships, purchased
   technology, patents and contractual agreements. Intangible assets are
   amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line
   method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years. No
   significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.

   Impairment of long-lived assets

   We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for
   impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
   the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An
   asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future
   net cash flow the asset is expected to generate.

   Allowance for transaction losses

   We are exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other
   payment misuse as well as nonperformance of and credit losses from
   sellers who accept payments through PayPal. We establish an allowance
   for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions,
   such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and
   merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services,
   ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and
   account overdrafts. This allowance represents an accumulation of the
   estimated amounts necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred
   as of the reporting date, including those which we have not yet
   identified. The allowance is monitored regularly and is updated based
   on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other
   actual data received. The allowance is based on known facts and
   circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar
   cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix
   of transaction and loss types. Additions to the allowance are reflected
   as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of
   income. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for transaction
   losses totaled $78 million and $66 million, respectively, and was
   included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

   Derivative instruments

   We have significant international revenues and costs denominated in
   foreign currencies, subjecting our operations to foreign currency risk.
   We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify as cash
   flow hedges, generally with maturities of 18 months or less, to reduce
   the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue
   denominated in certain foreign currencies. All outstanding derivatives
   are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The effective
   portion of the designated derivative's gain or loss is initially
   reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
   (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into the financial statement
   line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the period the
   forecasted transaction affects earnings.

   We also hedge our economic exposure to foreign currency denominated
   monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency contracts. The
   gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts economically offset
   transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency denominated
   monetary assets and liabilities recognized in earnings. Accordingly,
   these outstanding non-designated derivatives are recognized on the
   balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value from these
   contracts are recorded in other income (expense), net in the
   consolidated statement of income. Our hedging program is not designed
   or operated for trading or speculative purposes.

   Our derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent
   counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We
   seek to mitigate this risk by limiting counterparties to major
   financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major
   financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with
   one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored
   on an ongoing basis. See "Note 8--Derivative Instruments" for
   additional information related to the derivative instruments.

   Fair value of financial instruments

   Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on
   both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2).
   Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for
   transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.
   Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available
   pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in
   less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. As of
   December 31, 2016, and 2015 we did not have any assets or liabilities
   requiring measurement at fair value without observable market values
   that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value
   (Level 3). Our financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents,
   accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, funds receivable,
   certain customer accounts, accounts payable, and funds payable and
   amounts due to customers are carried at cost, which approximates their
   fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.



   Concentrations of risk

   Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans and interest
   receivable, and funds receivable and customer accounts are potentially
   subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash, cash equivalents and
   customer accounts are placed with financial institutions that
   management believes are of high credit quality. In addition, funds
   receivable are generated primarily with financial institutions or
   credit card companies which management believes are of high credit
   quality. We invest our cash, cash equivalents and customer accounts
   primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are
   uninsured. From time to time, we may also have corporate deposit
   balances with financial services institutions which exceed the Federal
   Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance limit of $250,000. As
   part of our cash management process, we perform periodic evaluations of
   the relative credit standing of these

   74
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   financial institutions. Our accounts receivable are derived from
   revenue earned from customers located in the U.S. and internationally.
   Our loans and interest receivable are derived from consumer and
   merchant financing activities for customers located in the U.S. and
   internationally. As of December 31, 2016, two customers respectively
   accounted for 29% and 24% of net accounts receivables. No customer
   accounted for more than 10% of net loans receivable as of December 31,
   2016. As of December 31, 2015 three customers accounted for 19%, 15%
   and 13% of net accounts receivables. No customer accounted for more
   than 10% of net loans receivable as of December 31, 2015. During the
   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer accounted for
   more than 10% of net revenues. During the years ended December 31,
   2016, 2015 and 2014, we earned approximately 22%, 26%, and 29% of
   revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform. No other source
   of revenue represented more than 10% of our revenue.

   Revenue recognition

   We earn net revenues primarily from fees charged to customers on the
   volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform. Net
   transaction revenues resulting from a payment processing transaction
   are recognized once the transaction is complete. Based on historical
   experience, specified credits are made at the time revenue is
   recognized and recorded as a reduction to revenue. In certain
   circumstances, we are required to record payments to a customer as a
   reduction to revenue. These payments to customers primarily originate
   from certain customer acquisition arrangements.

   We also earn net revenues from other value added services, including
   interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable
   portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of
   participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable, revenue
   share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal
   customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products
   and other services that we provide to our consumers and merchants. Net
   revenues earned from other value added services are recognized over the
   period services are performed and when amounts are deemed to be fixed
   or determinable. Interest and fees earned on the PayPal Credit
   portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on
   contractual interest and fee rates, and are net of any required
   reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.

   Advertising expense

   We expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production
   occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the
   period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales
   and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based
   on the terms of the individual agreements, which is generally over the
   greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the
   total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on
   a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising
   expense totaled $350 million, $303 million and $272 million for the
   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.



   Internal use software and website development costs

   Direct costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website
   development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimated
   useful life of one to three years and are recorded as depreciation and
   amortization. PayPal capitalized $341 million and $254 million of
   internally developed software and website development costs for the
   years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization
   expense for these capitalized costs was $208 million, $166 million and
   $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
   respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of internal use software
   and website development costs are expensed as incurred.

   Defined contribution savings plans

   We have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies
   under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Our
   non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related
   to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services
   are rendered by our employees.

   Stock-based compensation

   Prior to the separation, our employees participated in eBay's equity
   incentive plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and
   performance-based restricted stock units and the employee stock
   purchases made under eBay's employee stock purchase plan.

   All awards granted under these plans consisted of eBay common shares.
   Our consolidated statement of income reflected compensation expense for
   these stock-based plans associated with the portion of eBay's incentive
   plans in which our employees

   75
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   participated as well as an allocation of stock-based compensation of
   certain employees of eBay who provided general and administrative
   services on our behalf.

   Upon separation, outstanding awards granted to PayPal employees under
   eBay's equity incentive plans were converted into PayPal awards under
   PayPal's equity incentive plans based on a conversion ratio. This
   conversion ratio was determined as the closing per-share price of eBay
   shares on the last regular trading session prior to separation divided
   by the opening per-share price of PayPal shares on the first regular
   trading session after separation. There was no significant incremental
   stock-based compensation expense recorded as a result of the share
   conversions.

   For periods up to separation, we determined compensation expense
   associated with restricted stock units based on the fair value of
   eBay's common stock on the date of grant. Following separation, we
   determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units
   based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We
   determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on
   the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes
   valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a
   straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period
   for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly,
   stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016,
   2015 and 2014 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When
   estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of
   our employees as well as trends of actual option forfeitures.

   Foreign currency

   Most of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their
   respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and
   liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance
   sheet dates. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated into U.S.
   dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from the
   translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a
   component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses
   from foreign currency transactions are recognized as other income
   (expense), net.

   Income taxes

   We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which
   requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current
   year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax
   consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial
   statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax
   assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the
   effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If
   necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the
   amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based
   on available evidence. We report a liability for unrecognized tax
   benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
   taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any,
   related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.



   Net income per share

   Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the
   period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
   during the period. The weighted average number of common shares
   outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended
   December 31, 2016 was based on the weighted average number of common
   shares outstanding for the period. The weighted average number of
   common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for
   the year ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common
   shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to
   distribution and the weighted average number of common shares
   outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date. The
   weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and
   diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 was
   based on the number of shares of PayPal common stock outstanding on the
   distribution date. On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay
   stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015
   received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay
   common stock held as of the record date. Diluted net income per share
   is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted
   average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive
   common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of
   outstanding options and equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted
   net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. The
   calculation of diluted net income per share excludes all anti-dilutive
   common shares. The same number of shares was used to calculate diluted
   earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 since the 1.2
   billion shares that were distributed on the distribution date were not
   outstanding for those periods.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   In 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new
   accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard
   will replace all current GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all
   industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance
   provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is
   recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize
   revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
   customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the
   entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
   In 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to fiscal years, and
   interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
   2017. In 2016, the FASB updated the guidance for reporting revenue
   gross versus net to improve the implementation guidance on principal
   versus agent considerations, and for identifying performance
   obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In
   addition, the FASB introduced practical expedients and made narrow
   scope improvements to the new accounting guidance. We have evaluated
   the impact of this new standard and have concluded that our financial
   statements will not be materially impacted upon adoption. We will adopt
   the guidance on January 1, 2018. Either of the following transition
   methods is permitted: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the
   application of the new standard in each prior reporting period, or (ii)
   a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment
   to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year the new
   standard is first applied. We are continuing to evaluate the approach
   we will use when transitioning to this new guidance.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the
   classification and measurement of financial instruments. This new
   standard makes limited amendments to the guidance in GAAP by requiring
   equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair
   value recognized in net income. This new standard also amends the
   presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities
   measured at fair value and it also amends certain disclosure
   requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
   The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
   within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
   adoption is permitted in limited situations. We are required to apply
   the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis to all outstanding
   instruments, with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of
   adoption. Based on our current portfolio of cost method investments,
   the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact
   on our financial statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to accounting
   for leases, which will require lessees to recognize lease assets and
   lease liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations
   created by all leases with terms greater than twelve months. As we are
   not a lessor, other changes in the standard applicable to lessors do
   not apply. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim
   periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with
   early adoption permitted. We are required to adopt the guidance using a
   modified retrospective basis and can elect to apply optional practical
   expedients. We are evaluating the impact and approach to adopting this
   new accounting guidance on our financial statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to simplify the
   analysis for embedded derivatives. The new guidance clarifies that when
   assessing whether a contingent call or put option qualifies as a
   separate derivative from the host contract (e.g., the debt instrument),
   the nature of the exercise contingency would be excluded from the
   assessment. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim
   periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016,
   with early adoption permitted. We are required to apply the new
   guidance on a modified retrospective basis to all existing debt
   instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the
   amendments are effective. The adoption of this standard is not expected
   to have a material impact on our financial statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on investments that
   qualify for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase
   in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The new
   guidance eliminates the requirement for retrospective adjustment of the
   investment, results of operations and retained earnings as if the
   equity method had been in effect during all the previous periods that
   the investment had been held. Instead, under the new guidance, the cost
   of acquiring the additional interest in the investee would be added to
   the current basis of the previously held interest and equity method
   accounting would be adopted as of the date the investment becomes
   qualified for equity method accounting. The new standard is effective
   for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
   beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The
   guidance should be applied prospectively after adoption. The adoption
   of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our
   financial statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based
   payment compensation. The new guidance makes amendments to the
   following areas: accounting for income taxes upon vesting or settlement
   of awards, presentation of excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies on
   the statement of cash flows, accounting for forfeitures, minimum
   statutory withholding requirements and presentation of employee taxes
   paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares
   to meet minimum statutory withholding requirements. The new standard is
   effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
   years,

   beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We
   will adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. As a result of
   the adoption, stock-based compensation ("SBC") excess tax benefits or
   tax deficiencies will be reflected in the consolidated statement of
   income within the provision for income taxes rather than in the
   consolidated balance sheet within additional paid-in capital. This
   change will be applied prospectively. The amount of the impact to the
   provision for income taxes will depend on the difference between the
   market value of share-based awards at vesting or settlement and the
   grant date fair value recognized through SBC. Additionally, we will
   present the cash flows related to the applicable SBC excess tax
   benefits or tax deficiencies in operating activities along with other
   income tax cash flows rather than in financing activities on a
   prospective basis. Finally, we will continue to utilize an estimate of
   forfeitures as our approach when determining SBC. The remaining
   amendments are not expected to have a material impact on our financial
   statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the measurement of credit
   losses on financial instruments. Credit losses on loans, trade and
   other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and other
   instruments will reflect our current estimate of the expected credit
   losses (CECL). CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated
   life of the financial instrument using historical experience, current
   conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Generally we
   expect that CECL will result in the earlier recognition of allowances
   for losses compared to the current approach of estimating probable
   incurred losses. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities
   with unrealized losses will be recognized as allowances for credit
   losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized
   cost. Additional disclosures will be required, including information
   used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing
   receivables. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and
   interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
   2019, with early adoption permitted. We are required to apply the
   standard's provisions as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
   earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the
   guidance is adopted with impairment of available-for-sale debt
   securities applied prospectively after adoption. We are evaluating the
   impact and approach to adopting this new accounting guidance on our
   financial statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on classifying certain cash
   receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The new
   guidance addresses the classification of cash flows related to: debt
   prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt
   instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that
   are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the
   borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business
   combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds
   from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance, including
   bank-owned life insurance, distributions received from equity method
   investees and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The
   guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be
   applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than
   one class of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal
   years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
   December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should
   be applied retrospectively after adoption. The adoption of this
   standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
   statements.

   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for the income
   tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than
   inventory. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax
   consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than
   inventory, when the transfer occurs. The new standard is effective for
   fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
   with early adoption permitted in the first interim period.  A modified
   retrospective basis of application of the new guidance is required. We
   intend to adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. As a result
   of the adoption, we will record a decrease of approximately $42 million
   in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption,
   with a corresponding decrease in prepaid taxes related to the
   unamortized tax expense attributed to intra-entity transfers of assets
   (other than inventory) previously deferred. Upon adoption, when any new
   intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory occurs, we will
   recognize the income tax consequences associated with this activity in
   the consolidated statement of income in the period when the transaction
   takes place.



   In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on restricted cash on the
   statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires the classification
   and presentation of changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents in
   the statement of cash flows. Therefore, amounts generally described
   as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included
   with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and
   ending balances shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard
   is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
   years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
   permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively after
   adoption. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
   material impact on our financial statements.

   In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the definition of a
   business to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions
   should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The
   new guidance requires a company to evaluate if substantially all of the
   fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is
   concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar
   identifiable assets; if so, the set of assets and activities is not a
   business. The guidance also requires a business to

   78

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of
   outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in
   the guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The new
   standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
   those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
   adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied prospectively to any
   transactions occurring within the period of adoption. The adoption of
   this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our
   financial statements.

   In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for
   goodwill impairment. The guidance simplifies the measurement of
   goodwill impairment by removing step 2 of the goodwill impairment test,
   which requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets
   and liabilities of a reporting unit.  The new guidance requires
   goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting
   unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value; however, the loss
   recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to
   that reporting unit. The amendments should be applied on a prospective
   basis.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
   December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim or annual
   goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We are
   evaluating the impact this new accounting guidance will have on our
   financial statements.

   Note 3--Business Combinations

   There were no acquisitions or divestitures completed in 2016 and 2014.

   During 2015, we completed four acquisitions, reflecting 100% of the
   equity interests of the acquired companies, for an aggregate amount of
   $1.4 billion. During 2016, we finalized the allocation of the purchase
   consideration for Xoom, Paydiant, CyActive and one other acquisition,
   which resulted in a $10 million adjustment to goodwill primarily
   related to Xoom.

   Xoom

   We completed the acquisition of Xoom Corporation ("Xoom") in November
   2015 by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Xoom for $25 per
   share in cash. We acquired Xoom to offer a broader range of services to
   our global customer base, increase customer engagement and accelerate
   our entrance into the international remittances markets. The total
   purchase price of $1.1

   billion included cash consideration paid of approximately $961 million,
   net of cash acquired of $92 million, and the fair value of assumed
   unvested equity totaling $7 million.

   The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase
   consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
   assumed:

   The intangibles acquired consists primarily of partner relationships,
   technology, trade name and customer-related intangible assets, with an
   estimated useful life of 2 to 5 years. The excess of the purchase
   consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable
   intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is
   attributable to the workforce of Xoom and the synergies expected to
   arise from the acquisition. We do not expect goodwill to be deductible
   for income tax purposes.

   Paydiant

   We completed the acquisition of Paydiant, Inc. ("Paydiant") in April
   2015 for total consideration of approximately $230 million, net of cash
   acquired. We acquired Paydiant to expand our capabilities in mobile
   payments. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in
   approximately $49 million of technology and customer-related intangible
   assets, net liabilities of approximately $6 million, and initial
   goodwill of approximately $187 million. We do not expect goodwill to be
   deductible for income tax purposes.

   CyActive

   We completed the acquisition of CyActive Security, Ltd. ("CyActive") in
   April 2015 for total consideration of approximately $43 million, net of
   cash acquired. We acquired CyActive to further enhance our information
   security capabilities. The allocation of purchase consideration
   resulted in approximately $8 million of technology-related intangible
   assets, net liabilities of approximately $2 million, and initial
   goodwill of approximately $37 million. We do not expect goodwill to be
   deductible for income tax purposes.

   We have included the financial results of these acquired businesses in
   our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of
   acquisition. Revenues and expenses related to these acquisitions for
   the year ended December 31, 2015 were not material. Pro forma results
   of operations have not been presented because the effect of these
   acquisitions were not material to our financial results.

   The adjustments to goodwill during 2016 relate to measurement period

   acquired in 2015 was due primarily to the four acquisitions that we
   completed in 2015. The adjustments to goodwill during 2015 relate to
   foreign exchange rate translations.

   We elect to account for certain investments within customer accounts,
   including foreign-currency denominated available-for-sale investments,
   under the fair value option. As a result, any gains and losses from
   fair value changes on such investments are recognized in other income
   (expense), net on the consolidated statement of income. Election of the
   fair value option allows us to significantly reduce the accounting
   asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the changes in
   the fair value of available-for-sale investments and the corresponding
   foreign exchange gains and losses relating to customer liabilities. At
   December 31, 2016 and 2015, the estimated fair value of our investments
   included within funds receivable and customer accounts under the fair
   value option was $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. In the
   years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, $66 million and $65 million of
   net losses from fair value changes, respectively, were recognized in
   other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of income.

   The aggregate fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position
   was $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2016.  The aggregate gross
   unrealized loss on our short-term and long-term investments was not
   material as of December 31, 2016. We believe the decline in value is
   due to temporary market conditions and expect to recover the entire
   amortized cost basis of these securities.  We neither intend nor
   anticipate the need to sell these securities before recovery. We
   continue to monitor the performance of the investment portfolio and
   assess market and interest rate risk when evaluating whether
   other-than-temporary impairment exists.

   million. In the year ended December 31, 2016, $48 million of net losses
   from fair value changes was recognized in other income (expense), net
   on the consolidated statement of income.

   We have short-term restricted cash that we intend to use to support our
   global sabbatical program. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had
   long-term restricted cash related to Xoom and required as collateral by
   payment processors and for licensing rules in India.

   The aggregate fair value of short-term and long-term investments in an
   unrealized loss position was $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016.  The
   aggregate gross unrealized loss on our short-term and long-term
   investments was $5 million as of December 31, 2016. We believe the
   decline in value is due to temporary market conditions and expect to
   recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.  We neither
   intend nor anticipate the need to sell these securities before
   recovery.  We continue to monitor the performance of the investment
   portfolio and assess market and interest rate risk when evaluating
   whether other-than-temporary impairment exists.

   We had no material short-term or long-term investments that have been
   in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months as

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on
   both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2).
   Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for
   transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.
   Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available
   pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in
   less active markets, or models using market observable inputs.

   The majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing
   models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple
   inputs where applicable, such as currency rates, interest rate yield
   curves, option volatility and equity prices. Our derivative instruments
   are primarily short-term in nature, generally one month to one year in
   duration. Certain foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow
   hedges may have a duration of up to 18 months.

   We did not have any transfers of financial instruments between
   valuation levels during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As
   of December 31, 2016, we did not have any assets or liabilities
   requiring measurement at fair value without observable market values
   that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value
   (Level 3).

   Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments
   with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are
   composed primarily of bank deposits, government and agency securities
   and commercial paper.

   We elect to account for foreign currency denominated available-for-sale
   investments underlying funds receivable and customer accounts,
   short-term investments and long-term investments under the fair value
   option as further discussed in "Note 5--Funds Receivable and Customer
   Accounts" and "Note 6--Investments."

   Note 8--Derivative Instruments

   Summary of Derivative Instruments

   Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the
   volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in
   foreign currency exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit
   risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the
   terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our
   counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial
   institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one
   counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an
   ongoing basis.

   Foreign Exchange Contracts

   We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant
   international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign
   currencies, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. We have a
   foreign currency exposure management program whereby we designate
   certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities
   of 18 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily
   related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in foreign
   currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to help
   mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are
   adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign
   currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as
   cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the
   derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of
   accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently
   reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted
   transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized
   gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in
   earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign exchange
   contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the change in the fair
   value of the derivative instruments with the change in the fair value
   of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. We do not use any
   foreign exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

   For our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the
   amounts recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion were
   not material in each of the periods presented, and we did not exclude
   any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative
   instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. During the
   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we did not discontinue any
   cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted
   transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains
   or losses to earnings. As of December 31, 2016, we estimated that $123
   million of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges
   included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified
   into earnings within the next 12 months.

   86
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   We have an additional foreign currency exposure management program
   whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign
   exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
   other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts
   are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not
   entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on
   our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on
   our assets and liabilities are recorded in "Other income (expense),
   net," which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange
   contracts.

   Fair Value of Derivative Contracts

   Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties
   to our foreign exchange contracts, subject to applicable requirements,
   we are allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a
   single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have
   elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on
   a gross basis in our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, the
   potential effect of rights of setoff associated with our foreign
   exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities by
   $59 million, resulting in net derivative assets of $164 million. We are
   not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, cash collateral
   related to these derivative transactions.

   and equipment to eBay with a gross carrying amount of $63 million and a
   net book value of $15 million for proceeds of approximately $26
   million. The proceeds in excess of net book value were recorded as a
   contribution from eBay and resulted in an increase to net parent
   investment within stockholders' equity.

   Depreciation expense was $574 million in 2016, $515 million in 2015 and

   property and equipment included in accounts payable was not material in
   2015 and 2014.

   Note 10--Loans and Interest Receivable, Net

   We offer credit products to consumers who choose PayPal Credit as their
   funding source at checkout and working capital advances to certain
   small and medium-sized PayPal merchants through our PayPal Working
   Capital product. In the U.S., we work with independent chartered
   financial institutions that extend credit to the consumer or merchant
   using our credit products. For our consumer credit products outside the
   U.S., we extend credit through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary. For
   our merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend working
   capital advances in the U.K. through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary,
   and we extend working capital advances in Australia through an
   Australian subsidiary. We purchase the related receivables extended by
   an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S. and are
   responsible for servicing functions related to all our credit products.
   During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we purchased
   approximately $8.4 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, in credit
   receivables. As part of the arrangement with an independent chartered
   financial institution in the U.S., we sell back a participation
   interest in the pool of consumer receivables outstanding under PayPal
   Credit consumer accounts. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the
   sale of the participation interest are not material as the carrying
   amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value
   at time of transfer. However, we have a separate arrangement with
   certain investors under which we sell to these investors a
   participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we
   purchased, where the consideration received exceeded the carrying
   amount of the participation interest sold which results in a gain
   reflected as net revenues in our consolidated financial statements.
   Loans, advances and interest and fees receivable are reported at their
   outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold
   and pro-rata allowances, including unamortized deferred origination
   costs and estimated collectible interest and fees.

   Consumer receivables

   As of December 31, 2016, the total outstanding balance in our pool of
   consumer receivables was $5.1 billion, net of the participation
   interest sold to the independent chartered financial institution and
   other investors of $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2015, the total
   outstanding balance in our pool of consumer receivables was $4.0
   billion, net of the participation interest sold to the independent
   chartered financial institution and other investors of $1.0 billion.
   The independent chartered financial institution and other investors
   have no recourse against us related to their participation interests
   for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests

   89
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   held by the chartered financial institution and other investors have
   the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the
   same credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this
   pool of consumer receivables. All risks of loss are shared equally
   based on participation interests held amongst all participating
   stakeholders.

   We use a consumer's FICO score, where available, among other measures,
   in evaluating the credit quality of our U.S. PayPal Credit consumer
   receivables. A FICO score is a type of credit score that lenders use to
   assess an applicant's credit risk and whether to extend credit.
   Individual FICO scores generally are obtained each quarter in which the
   U.S. consumer has an outstanding consumer receivable owned by PayPal
   Credit. The weighted average U.S. consumer FICO scores related to our
   loans and interest receivable balance outstanding at December 31, 2016
   and December 31, 2015 were 682 and 686, respectively.

   As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 52.1% and
   53.6%, respectively, of the pool of U.S. consumer receivables and
   interest receivable balance was due from U.S. consumers with FICO
   scores greater than 680, which is generally considered "prime" by the
   consumer credit industry. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31,
   2015, approximately 11.1% and 9.4%, respectively, of the pool of U.S.
   consumer receivables and interest receivable balance was due from U.S.
   customers with FICO scores below 599. As of December 31, 2016 and
   December 31, 2015, approximately 90.0% and 90.1%, respectively, of the
   portfolio of consumer receivables and interest receivable was current.

   The following table presents the principal amount of U.S. consumer

   or purchase through that product to manage and evaluate our related
   exposure to credit risk. To assess a merchant seeking a PayPal Working
   Capital advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model that we
   have internally developed that we refer to as our PayPal Working
   Capital Risk Model ("PRM"), as a credit quality indicator to help
   predict the merchant's ability to repay the principal balance and fixed
   fee related to the working capital advance. The PRM uses multiple
   variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay a working
   capital advance. Drivers of the model include the merchant's annual
   payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior
   repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital product, and other
   measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of
   350 to 750. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and
   to pose limited credit risk. We generally expect that merchants to
   which we extend a working capital advance will have PRM scores greater
   than 525. We assess a participating merchant's PRM score on a recurring
   basis for all outstanding working capital advances owned by PayPal. At
   December 31, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average PRM score related to
   our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 625 and 630,
   respectively.

   The following table presents the principal amount of PayPal Working
   Capital advances and fees receivable segmented by our internal PRM
   score range:

   Through our PayPal Working Capital product, merchants can borrow a
   certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal
   and are charged a fixed fee for the advance, which approximates an
   Annual Percentage Rate ("APR") based on the overall credit assessment
   of the merchant. Advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the
   merchant's future payment volume that PayPal processes. The fee is
   fixed at the time the advance is extended and we estimate the repayment
   period based on PayPal's payment processing history with the merchant.
   There is no stated interest rate and there is a general requirement
   that at least 10%

   of the original amount advanced plus the fixed fee must be repaid every
   90 days. We generally calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's
   future payment volume so that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is
   expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance.
   On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the
   repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods
   are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. We monitor
   receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected
   repayment period. We charge off the receivable when the updated
   repayment period is 180 days past the original expected repayment
   period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We
   also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is 360
   days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether
   or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days.

   The following tables present our estimate of the principal amount of
   PayPal Working Capital advances and fees receivable past their original
   expected repayment period. In the second quarter of 2016, we refined
   our estimate of the original expected repayment period to take into
   account the variability in repayment patterns. Prior period amounts
   have been updated to reflect this change.

   The provision for loan losses relating to our PayPal Working Capital
   advances is recognized in transaction and loan losses and the provision
   for fees receivable is recognized in deferred revenues in our
   consolidated balance sheet as a reduction in deferred revenue.

   Note 11--Segment and Geographical Information

   We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating
   decision maker manages the business, including making operating
   decisions, deciding how to allocate resources and evaluating operating
   performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive
   Officer who reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We
   operate in one segment and have one reportable segment.

   Net revenues earned from transaction revenues are attributed to U.S.,

   merchant is located, or in the case of a cross-border transaction, may
   be earned from the country in which the consumer and the merchant
   respectively reside. Net revenues earned from value added services are
   typically attributed to the country in which either the customer or
   partner reside. Tangible long-lived assets for the years ended

   Note 12--Commitments and Contingencies

   Commitments

   As of December 31, 2016, approximately $28.8 billion of unused credit
   was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $24.8
   billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2015. While this amount
   represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced,
   and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders
   will access their entire available credit at any given point in time.
   In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused
   credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered
   financial institution that is the issuer of PayPal Credit products
   based on, among other things, account usage and customer
   creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a
   PayPal Credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the
   chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds
   the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the
   merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the
   consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as
   a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan
   defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own
   each customer account, we own the related receivable (excluding
   participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing
   functions related to the account.

   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement
   ("Credit Agreement") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion,
   five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter
   of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with
   available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the
   amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding.
   Borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement are
   guaranteed by PayPal, Inc. (the "Guarantor"). We may also, subject to
   the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under
   the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million. Subject to
   specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries
   as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement provided that we and
   the Guarantor guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any
   such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016,
   no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed
   under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital
   expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. As of
   December 31, 2016, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding
   under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, $2.0
   billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted
   by the Credit Agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

   Lease Arrangements

   We have lease obligations under certain non-cancelable operating
   leases. Our non-cancelable operating lease agreements typically have
   terms between 3-10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal
   options. We recognize rent expense under such agreements on a
   straight-line basis.

   Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases at
   December 31, 2016, are as follows:

   Litigation and Regulatory Matters

   Overview

   We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing
   basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and may seek an
   indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from
   such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
   estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of
   estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the
   range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none
   of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other
   amount, we accrue at the low end of the range. For those proceedings in
   which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable,
   we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range
   of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably
   possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding
   (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are
   not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible
   loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have
   disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal
   proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary
   damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary
   remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may
   require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have
   a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters
   disclosed in this Note 12, we are unable to estimate the possible loss
   or range of losses that could potentially result from the application
   of such non-monetary remedies.

   Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we
   believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended
   December 31, 2016. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings
   described in this Note 12, we have concluded, based on currently

   94
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly
   from these proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in
   judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not
   material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently
   unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more
   matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in
   excess of management's expectations, the impact on our operating
   results or financial condition for that reporting period could be
   material.

   Regulatory Proceedings

   We are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the
   U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
   ("OFAC"). We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were
   inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible
   violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we
   reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising
   from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to
   the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program.
   Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible
   violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking
   additional information about certain of these transactions. Such
   self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against
   us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or
   penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner
   that could result in a material loss, require significant management
   time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or
   otherwise harm our business.

   On March 28, 2016, we received a Civil Investigative Demand ("CID")
   from the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") as part of its investigation
   to determine whether we, through our Venmo service, have been or are
   engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in violation of the Federal
   Trade Commission Act.  The CID requests the production of documents and
   answers to written questions related to our Venmo service. We are
   cooperating with the FTC in connection with the CID.  The CID could
   lead to an enforcement action and/or one or more consent orders, which
   may result in substantial costs, including legal fees, fines,
   penalties, and remediation expenses and actions, and could require us
   to change the manner in which we operate Venmo.

   Legal Proceedings

   On December 28, 2016, a putative securities class action captioned Cho
   v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:16-cv-07371, was filed in
   the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the
   "Securities Case"). The Securities Case asserts claims allegedly
   relating to our disclosure in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
   quarterly period ended March 31, 2016, that on March 28, 2016, we
   received a Civil Investigative Demand from the FTC as part of its
   investigation to determine whether we, through our Venmo service, have
   been or are engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in violation of
   the Federal Trade Commission Act.  The Securities Case purports to be
   brought on behalf of purchasers of eBay's stock on or after December
   19, 2013 who subsequently received the Company's stock pursuant to
   eBay's spin-off of the Company, effective as of July 17, 2015, and/or
   purchasers of the Company's stock between July 20, 2015 and April 28,
   2016, and asserts claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") against the
   Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and
   former interim Chief Financial Officer, and eBay and certain of its
   former officers, including the Chairman of our Board of Directors. The
   Securities Case alleges that defendants made materially false and
   misleading statements or omissions regarding our compliance with
   applicable laws and regulations, including the failure to disclose that
   we were purportedly engaging in unfair trade practices through our
   Venmo service and that as a result of alleged false and misleading
   statements or omissions, our stock traded at artificially inflated
   prices.  The Securities Case seeks unspecified compensatory damages on
   behalf of the putative class members.  We believe the claims and
   allegations in the Securities Case are without merit and intend to
   defend the action vigorously.

   On January 12, 2017, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned
   Silverman v. Schulman, et al., Case No. 5:17-cv-00162, was filed in the
   U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California based on
   substantially similar allegations underlying the Securities Case
   described above (the "Derivative Case").  The Derivative Case is
   purportedly brought on behalf of the Company and alleges that the
   Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, former
   interim Chief Financial Officer, and members of its Board of Directors
   breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, violated Section 14(a)
   of the Exchange Act, and were unjustly enriched by, among other things,
   causing or permitting the Company to issue materially false and
   misleading statements or omissions regarding the Company's compliance
   with applicable laws and regulation with respect to its Venmo service,
   as alleged in the Securities Case, and by permitting or causing the
   Company to engage in unfair trade practices through its Venmo service.
   The Derivative Case seeks, among other things, to recover unspecified
   compensatory damages on behalf of the Company arising out of the
   individual defendants' alleged wrongful conduct. Although plaintiff in
   this action does not seek relief against the Company, we have certain
   indemnification obligations to the individual defendants.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   We have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ")
   seeking the production of certain information related to our historical
   anti-money laundering program. We are cooperating with the DOJ in
   providing information in response to the subpoenas. We are unable to
   predict the outcome of the government's investigation.

   General Matters

   Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may
   claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property
   rights. We are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we will
   increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims
   involving various aspects of our business as our products and services
   continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought
   directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our
   customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under
   their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to
   such claims as a result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases
   where we are entering into new lines of business in connection with
   such acquisitions. We have in the past been forced to litigate such
   claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims
   will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether
   meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and
   resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing
   business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing
   agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle
   claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.

   From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory
   inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including
   suits by our customers (individually or as class actions) alleging,
   among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or
   policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies or customer/user
   agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or
   not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies or
   agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory
   inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and/or legal
   review and/or challenges that tend to reflect the increasing global
   regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when
   taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative action, such
   actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens
   on our business and customers and may lead to increased costs and
   decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and
   significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our
   Company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope (both in
   terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our
   geographical operations) and our products and services have increased
   in complexity. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether
   meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly
   litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory
   damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines,
   penalties, injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business
   through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our
   business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of
   management time, result in the diversion of significant operational
   resources or otherwise harm our business.

   Indemnification Provisions

   We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various
   other agreements with eBay to govern the separation and relationship of
   the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific
   indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between
   us and eBay, which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity
   rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient
   to protect us and our indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.

   In the ordinary course of business, we include limited indemnification
   provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have
   commercial relationships, including our standard marketing, promotions,
   and application-programming-interface license (API) agreements. Under
   these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to
   reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
   indemnified party in connection with claims by any third-party with
   respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding
   elements to the extent that such marks are related to the subject
   agreement. In a limited number of agreements, we have provided an
   indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which are indemnities
   mainly related to intellectual property rights. We have also provided
   an indemnity to our payments processors in the event of certain
   third-party claims or card association fines against the processor
   arising out of conduct by us or our customers. It is not possible to
   determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification
   provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims
   and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
   situation. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either
   individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification
   provisions.



   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet
   arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
   future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
   of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

   Protection Programs

   We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on
   substantially all transactions completed through our Payments Platform,
   except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. These
   programs protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due
   to fraud and counterparty performance. Our Buyer Protection Program
   provides protection to consumers for qualifying purchases by
   reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a
   purchased item does not arrive or does not match the seller's
   description. Our Seller Protection Programs provide protection to
   merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the
   buyer or claims that an item was not received by covering the seller
   for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales.

   The maximum potential exposure under our protection programs is
   estimated to be the portion of total eligible transaction volume (TPV)
   for which buyer or seller protection claims may be raised under our
   existing user agreements. Since eligible transactions are typically
   completed in a period significantly shorter than the period under which
   disputes may be opened, and based on our historical losses to date, we
   do not believe that the maximum potential exposure is representative of
   our actual potential exposure. The actual amount of potential exposure
   cannot be quantified as we are unable to determine total eligible
   transactions where performance by a merchant or customer is incomplete
   or completed transactions that may result in a claim under our
   protection programs. We record a liability with respect to losses under
   these protection programs when they are probable and the amount can be
   reasonably estimated.

   The following table provides management's estimate of the maximum
   potential exposure related to our protection programs as of
   December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

   Note 13--Related Party Transactions

   As of December 31, 2016, there were no material amounts payable to or
   amounts receivable from related parties. All contracts with related
   parties are at rates and terms that we believe are comparable with
   those that could be entered into with independent third parties. For
   all periods subsequent to the distribution, there were no material
   related party transactions.

   Prior to the distribution, our business comprised the Payments segment
   of eBay and thus our transactions with eBay were considered related
   party transactions. In connection with the separation, we entered into
   a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other
   agreements that govern our relationships with eBay going forward,
   including an operating agreement, transition services agreement, tax
   matters agreement, employee matters agreement, intellectual property
   matters agreement and colocation services agreements. Information
   included in this Note 13 with respect to eBay is strictly limited to
   our related party transactions with eBay prior to the separation (i.e.,
   periods up to July 17, 2015). Following separation, transactions with
   eBay represent third-party transactions on an arms-length basis.

   We earned net revenues of $59 million and $113 million from eBay and
   its subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
   respectively. Prior to the distribution, we recovered certain amounts
   from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible
   eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual
   transaction losses associated with customer-filed claims as well as an
   allocation of salary-related expenses for our customer support teams
   working on customer claims and

   97

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   disputes related to eligible eBay purchases. Recoveries associated with
   transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the years
   ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $27 million and $43 million,
   respectively, which were recorded as a reduction to transaction and
   loan loss. Other costs recovered from eBay related to the customer
   protection programs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014
   were $12 million and $22 million, respectively, and were included as a
   reduction to customer support and operations and general and
   administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income.
   Following the distribution, eBay's customer protection programs are no
   longer administered by us, and therefore these costs are no longer
   reimbursed by eBay.

   Prior to the distribution, we incurred user acquisition fees from eBay
   on payment volume which we processed from purchases made on eBay's
   platform. User acquisition fees during the years ended December 31,
   2015 and 2014 were $64 million and $119 million, respectively.
   Following the distribution, pursuant to the operating agreement, we
   incur referral services fees from eBay based on a fixed rate per new
   user.

   Prior to the distribution, these consolidated financial statements
   include expenses associated with workplace resources and information
   technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of
   eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions,
   including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These
   expenses also include allocations related to share based compensation.
   These expenses allocated to us by eBay are based on direct usage or
   benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata
   basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. We consider
   the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all
   periods presented. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses to us
   from eBay included within customer support and operations, sales and
   marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses
   were $303 million and $443 million for the years ended December 31,
   2015 and 2014, respectively.

   In the second and third quarter of 2015, pursuant to the Separation and
   Distribution Agreement between eBay and us, eBay transferred
   substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of
   eBay's payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015
   (the "capitalization"). As part of the capitalization, we received from
   eBay a contribution of cash of approximately $3.8 billion, as well as a
   related estimated deferred tax liability of $236 million associated
   with the foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely
   reinvested. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reassessed the
   measurement of the deferred tax liability and, based on updated
   valuation information, reduced the deferred tax liability balance to
   $172 million as of December 31, 2015. The adjustment to deferred tax
   liability was recorded as a contribution from eBay and resulted in an
   increase to net parent investment within stockholders' equity. During
   the second and third quarter of 2015, eBay also contributed property
   and equipment with a net book value of approximately $224 million and
   intangible assets with a net book value of approximately $18 million.
   Additionally, we sold certain property and equipment to eBay with a
   gross carrying amount of $63 million and a net book value of $15
   million for proceeds of approximately $26 million. The proceeds in
   excess of net book value were recorded as a contribution from eBay and
   resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholders'
   equity.

   Note 14--Stock Repurchase Program

   In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
   program that provides for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our
   common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This
   stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution
   from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
   and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases
   of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share
   repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open
   market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or
   other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
   appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other
   financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to
   market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or
   when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our
   stock repurchase program at any time without notice.

   The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during
   the year ended December 31, 2016 is summarized as follows:

   Note 15--Stock-Based and Employee Savings Plans

   Prior to the separation (i.e., periods up to July 17, 2015), PayPal
   employees participated in eBay's equity incentive plans, including
   stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based
   restricted stock units ("PBRSUs"). In addition, certain PayPal
   employees participated in eBay's employee stock purchase plan. All
   awards granted under these plans consisted of eBay common shares.
   PayPal's consolidated statement of income reflected compensation
   expense for these stock-based plans associated with the portion of
   eBay's equity incentive plans in which PayPal employees participated.

   Following separation, outstanding awards granted to PayPal employees
   under eBay's equity incentive plans were converted into PayPal awards
   under PayPal's equity incentive plans based on a conversion ratio. This
   conversion ratio was determined as the closing per-share price of eBay
   shares on the last regular trading session prior to separation divided
   by the opening per-share price of PayPal shares on the first regular
   trading session after separation. There was no significant incremental
   stock-based compensation expense recorded as a result of the share
   conversions.

   Equity Incentive Plans

   The Board of Directors adopted the PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity
   Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan") on June 16, 2015. Under the terms of
   the Plan, equity awards, including stock options, RSUs, restricted
   stock awards, PBRSUs, deferred stock units, and stock payments may be
   granted to our directors, officers and employees. At December 31,
   2016, we had 92 million shares authorized under our equity incentive
   plans and 61 million shares were available for future grant. Shares
   issued as a result of stock option exercises and the release of stock
   awards were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of common
   stock.

   99
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
   PayPal Holdings, Inc.
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   All stock options granted under these plans generally
   vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one year from the
   date of hire for grants to new employees) with the remainder vesting at
   a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and generally
   expire seven to ten years from the date of grant. The cost of stock
   options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on
   the date of grant.

   RSUs are granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive
   plans. In general, RSUs vest in equal annual installments over a period
   of three to four years, are subject to an employee's continuing service
   to us and do not have an expiration date. The cost of RSUs granted
   prior to the separation was determined using the fair value of eBay's
   common stock on the date of grant. For RSUs granted following
   separation, the cost of RSUs was determined using the fair value of
   PayPal's common stock on the date of grant.

   Certain of our executives are eligible to receive performance-based
   restricted stock units ("PBRSUs"). PBRSUs are equity awards that may be
   earned based on an initial target number with the final number of
   PBRSUs that may be vested and settled determined based on the Company's
   performance against pre-established performance metrics over a
   predefined performance period. PBRSUs granted under eBay's equity
   incentive plans generally have two-year performance periods with
   one-half of the grant vesting in March following the end of the
   performance period and the remaining one-half vesting more than one
   year following the completion of the performance period. In the first
   quarter of 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a revised
   structure for PBRSUs granted under PayPal's 2015 Equity Incentive Award
   Plan to officers and certain employees providing services to the
   Company. PBRSUs granted under PayPal's 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan
   have three-year performance periods with cliff vesting following the
   completion of the performance period, subject to the Committee's
   approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established
   performance targets. Over the performance period, the number of PBRSUs
   that may be issued and related stock-based compensation expense that is
   recognized is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of
   achieving the approved performance targets against the performance
   metrics. Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established
   performance targets, the PBRSUs issued could range from 0% to 200% of
   the target amount.

   Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   Prior to separation, eligible employees participated in eBay's employee
   stock purchase plan. Effective July 17, 2015, the Board of Directors
   adopted the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
   ("ESPP"). Under the terms of this plan, shares of our common stock may
   be purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of two
   years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of
   the applicable offering period or on the last business day of each
   six-month purchase period within the offering period. Employees may
   purchase shares between 2% and 10% of their gross compensation during
   an offering period but not more than the statutory limitation of
   $25,000 per year. The company stock purchased through the ESPP is
   considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average
   outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings
   per share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our employees
   purchased 2.7 million shares of PayPal common stock at an average price
   of $29.49. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our employees
   purchased 0.9 million shares of eBay common stock at an average price
   of $44.37 and 1.2 million shares of PayPal common stock at an average
   price of $28.12. Under eBay's employee stock purchase plan for the year
   ended December 31, 2014 our employees purchased approximately 1.5
   million shares of eBay common stock at an average price of $42.16. As
   of December 31, 2016, approximately 8.1 million shares were reserved
   for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

   As of December 31, 2016, there was approximately $707 million of
   unearned stock-based compensation estimated to be expensed from 2017
   through 2019. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the
   underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase
   or cancel all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based
   compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will
   increase to the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the
   mix of grants between stock options and RSUs or assume unvested equity
   awards in connection with acquisitions.

   Stock Option Valuation Assumptions

   We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant
   using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted
   average assumptions were used for the years ended December 31, 2016,
   2015 and 2014:


   Year Ended December 31,

   Expected volatility
   25

   26
   %

   29
   %

   For periods prior to separation, our computation of expected volatility
   was based on a combination of historical and market-based implied
   volatility from traded options on eBay's stock. The computation of
   expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar
   awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the
   stock-based awards, vesting schedules, and expectations of future
   employee behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual
   life of the award was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
   at the time of grant.

   For periods subsequent to the separation, the risk-free interest rate
   for periods within the contractual life of the award was based upon the
   U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. Due to
   our limited history of stock option exercises, we estimated the
   expected term of options granted based on the midpoint between the
   vesting date and the end of the contractual term using the "simplified"
   method under the SEC guidance. The computation of expected volatility
   for our employee stock option awards was based on the historical
   volatility of selected peer companies.

   Employee Saving Plans

   Prior to separation, eligible U.S. employees participated in eBay's
   savings plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code.
   Effective July 17, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the PayPal
   Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the terms of this
   plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their
   eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In 2016,
   2015 and 2014, under PayPal's and eBay's savings plans, eligible
   employees received one dollar for each dollar

   102
     __________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   contributed, up to 4% of each employee's eligible salary, subject to a
   maximum employer contribution of $10,600, $10,600 and $10,400,
   respectively, per employee. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other
   savings plans. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
   the matching contribution expense for our U.S. and international
   savings plans were approximately $42 million, $42 million and $37
   million, respectively.

   Note 16--Income Taxes

   For periods ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, we were a member of the
   eBay consolidated group and our U.S. taxable income was included in the
   consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of eBay as well as in
   returns filed by eBay with certain state and local taxing
   jurisdictions. Our foreign income tax returns were filed on a separate
   company basis. For periods ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, our
   income tax liability has been computed and presented herein under the
   "separate return method" as if we were a separate tax paying entity, as
   modified by the benefits-for-loss approach. Accordingly, our operating
   losses and other tax attributes are characterized as utilized when
   those attributes have been utilized by other members of the eBay
   consolidated group; however, the benefits-for-loss approach does not
   impact our tax expense. Federal and unitary state income taxes incurred
   for periods ended on or prior to July 17, 2015 are remitted to eBay
   pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the companies.

   In connection with the distribution, eBay and PayPal entered into
   various agreements that govern the relationship between the parties
   going forward, including a tax matters agreement. The tax matters
   agreement was entered into on the distribution date. Under the tax
   matters agreement, eBay generally is responsible for all additional
   taxes (and will be entitled to all related refunds of taxes) imposed on
   eBay and its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries that were transferred
   to PayPal pursuant to the separation) arising after the distribution
   date with respect to the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ended on
   or prior to July 17, 2015, except for those taxes for which PayPal has
   reflected an unrecognized tax benefit in its financial statements on
   the distribution date.

   The difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal
   statutory rate of 35.0% to income before income taxes is primarily the
   result of foreign income taxed at different rates and, for the year
   ended December 31, 2014, the accrual of U.S. income tax on
   undistributed foreign profits for 2013 and prior years previously
   indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S.

   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
   consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
   liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in
   effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
   Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the
   following:

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   In 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17,
   "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes", which simplifies the
   presentation of deferred income taxes. This guidance requires that
   deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a
   classified statement of financial position. We early adopted the FASB's
   new accounting guidance effective for the year ended December 31, 2015.

   In 2015, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between
   eBay and us, we received from eBay a contribution of cash of
   approximately $3.8 billion, as well as a related estimated deferred tax
   liability of $172 million associated with foreign earnings that are not
   considered indefinitely reinvested. The adjustment to deferred tax
   liability was recorded as a contribution from eBay and resulted in an
   increase to net parent investment within stockholders' equity.

   As of December 31, 2016, our federal, state and foreign net operating
   loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $110
   million, $281 million, and $54 million, respectively. The federal and
   state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various
   limitations under Section 382 of the Code. If not utilized, the federal
   net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019, and the
   state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017.
   The majority of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards have no
   expiration date and may be carried forward indefinitely. As of
   December 31, 2016, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for
   income tax purposes were approximately $5 million and $60 million,
   respectively. The federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2032.
   Most of the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.

   In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
   considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion
   of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2016,
   we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our
   deferred tax assets relating to operating losses in certain states and
   foreign jurisdictions and tax credits in certain states that we believe
   are not likely to be realized. At December 31, 2015, we maintained a
   valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for operating losses
   in certain states and foreign jurisdictions that we believe are not
   likely to be realized.



   At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $3.4 billion of indefinitely
   reinvested foreign earnings for which we had not provided U.S. income
   or applicable foreign withholding taxes. During 2014, we altered our
   capital allocation strategy, which included changing our intent with
   regard to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings from certain
   of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. As a result, we
   provided taxes and recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately
   $650 million on $1.9 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of
   certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years.

   We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding
   taxes on $4.6 billion of our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed
   earnings as of December 31, 2016, because such earnings are intended to
   be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. We do not
   know the time or manner in which we would repatriate those funds;
   therefore, we cannot quantify the tax liability associated with the
   future repatriation of such earnings. In cases where we do not intend
   to indefinitely reinvest a portion of our foreign subsidiaries'
   undistributed earnings, we provide U.S. taxes on such earnings and such
   taxes are included in deferred taxes or tax payable liabilities
   depending upon the planned timing and manner of such repatriation.

   We benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different
   jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore and Luxembourg. These
   rulings result in significantly lower rates of taxation on certain
   classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and
   employment in those jurisdictions. We review our compliance on an
   annual basis to ensure we continue to meet our obligations under these
   tax rulings. These rulings resulted in tax savings of approximately
   $310 million, $285 million and $217 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
   respectively. The benefit of these tax rulings on our net income per
   share (diluted) was approximately $0.25, $0.23 and $0.18 in 2016, 2015
   and 2014, respectively. These tax rulings expire over periods ranging
   from 2020 to 2021.

   On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner,
   invalidated part of a Treasury Regulation requiring stock-based
   compensation to be included in a qualified intercompany cost sharing
   arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on
   December 1, 2015. On February 19, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service
   filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, with
   follow up briefs filed by both Altera and the Internal Revenue Service
   to the appeals court during the second half of 2016. We have reviewed
   this case and its impact on PayPal and concluded that no adjustment to
   the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time. We
   will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to
   our consolidated financial statements.

   $
   165

   If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in
   a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $271 million.



   During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties
   related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. In 2016 we
   recognized net interest and penalties of $13 million in income tax
   expense. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of
   December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67 million and $54
   million, respectively.

   We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign
   jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by certain tax
   authorities for the 2003 to 2015 tax years. The material jurisdictions
   in which we are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years
   after 2002 primarily include the U.S. (Federal and California), France,
   Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Singapore and United Kingdom. We believe
   that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may
   ultimately result from these examinations.

   Although the timing of the resolution of these audits is uncertain, we
   do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of
   December 31, 2016 will materially change in the next 12 months.
   However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and
   the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the
   full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized
   tax benefits.

   Note 17--Restructuring

   In January 2015, at a regular meeting of the eBay board of directors
   (the "eBay Board"), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a
   strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was
   completed by the end of 2015. We recognized $48 million of
   restructuring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, all of
   which were paid by the end of 2015.

   No restructuring expenses were recognized during the years ended
   December 31, 2016 and 2014.
