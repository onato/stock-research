PayPal Releases 1Q 2025 Results

PayPal President and CEO Alex Chriss with Linzi Rooney of Born & Bred, a PayPal small business
merchant in Belfast, Northern Ireland who was featured at our recent global all hands employee meeting.

PayPal released its first quarter 2025 financial results this morning. We encourage you to read
the full materials and listen to our earnings call at 8:00 AM ET.

In 1Q, PayPal delivered a strong quarter to start the year:
  - Transaction margin dollars1 of $3.7B, +7%
  - Non-GAAP operating income of $1.6B, +16%; GAAP operating income of $1.5B, +31%
  - Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7%, +257 bps; GAAP operating margin of 19.6%, +447 bps
  - Non-GAAP EPS of $1.33, +23%; GAAP EPS of $1.29, +56%

President and CEO Alex Chriss said, "PayPal had a great start to the year and our strategy is
working. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with progress across branded
checkout, PSP, omnichannel, and Venmo."

Chriss continued, "We are transforming into the leading commerce platform connecting
consumers and merchants globally. Our foundation is solid and we have multiple ways to win."

We are seeing clear signs of strength across the business. Transaction margin dollars1
excluding interest on customer balances2 accelerated sequentially to 7%. Online branded
checkout TPV grew nearly 6% ex. leap day, and our new checkout experience is now available
on more than 45% of US checkout traffic. Branded experiences TPV, which includes online
branded checkout, as well as debit and tap-to-pay, grew 8% ex. leap day, highlighting the
growing contribution of our omnichannel initiatives. We accelerated Venmo monetization, with
revenue growing 20%, and our PSP business contributed meaningfully to transaction margin
dollar growth.

As we transform PayPal from a payments company to a commerce platform, we are building
more holistic relationships with consumers by bringing our value proposition everywhere they
shop and pay. The best way to see the traction we're gaining is through branded experiences
TPV, which accelerated two points in the first quarter compared to the full year 2024. We
added nearly two million first-time PayPal and Venmo debit card users in the quarter. This
growth is significant because we see a halo effect with debit card users choosing to check out
with PayPal more often. We are making steady progress growing omnichannel, and it is
driving our commerce flywheel.

For the second quarter of 2025, we expect:
  - Transaction margin dollars1 of $3.75B to $3.80B, or 4% to 5% growth
  - Non-GAAP EPS of $1.29 to $1.31, or 8% to 10% growth
  - GAAP EPS of $1.24 to $1.26

Despite a strong first quarter and good start to the second quarter, we are maintaining our full
year 2025 guidance due to uncertainty in the global macro environment:
  - Transaction margin dollars1 of $15.2B to $15.4B, or 4% to 5% growth
  - Non-GAAP EPS of $4.95 to $5.10, or 6% to 10% growth
  - GAAP EPS of $4.80 to $4.95
  - Free cash flow of $6B to $7B
  - Share repurchase of ~$6B

As we shared at Investor Day, we are transforming PayPal into a diversified commerce
platform. We have a strong foundation to navigate whatever lies ahead, and our teams are
focused on execution.

Thank you for your continued interest in PayPal,
Steve and team
