President and CEO Alex Chriss said, "PayPal delivered another strong quarter and we are
raising guidance, with broad-based profitable growth across branded experiences, PSP, and
Venmo. We have returned the company to growth and are on pace for 6% to 7% transaction
margin dollar growth in 2025 when excluding interest on customer balances. We are also
building for an agentic future, partnering with leaders such as Google, OpenAI, and
Perplexity."

Chriss continued, "This is a stronger company today than we were two years ago. With
differentiated competitive advantages, clear strategic direction and building execution
momentum, we believe we are exceptionally well-placed to win into the future."

Over the past two years, we have made good progress reinvigorating key parts of our
business. We are modernizing our branded checkout experience and rolling it out to more
merchants. Venmo and PSP growth are both accelerating, and our omnichannel and buy now,
pay later (BNPL) initiatives are scaling rapidly.

Growth during the quarter was broad-based across our initiatives including:
  - Branded experiences, which saw total payment volume (TPV) growth of 8% on a
    currency-neutral (FXN) basis;
  - Venmo, with revenue up 20%5 and TPV up 14%;
  - PSP, with TPV up 6% FXN; and
  - BNPL TPV up more than 20%.

In the US, where our online checkout and omnichannel initiatives have been focused to-date,
branded experiences TPV growth was even higher at 10%. We are just starting to scale these
products and efforts globally. More than 20% of our global branded checkout traffic is now on
our redesigned paysheet, and we are driving biometric login adoption.

Engagement is increasing with monthly active accounts up 2% and Venmo monthly active
accounts up 7%. Total active accounts grew 1%, and transactions per active account ex-PSP
grew 5%.

Finally, we are continuing to innovate in agentic commerce, ads, stablecoins, and digital wallet
interoperability. PayPal World is in its pilot stage, and we are in the process of adding more
global payment partners like e& and Ooredoo Fintech in the Middle East. We also announced
a new agentic commerce partnership with OpenAI, introduced our Agentic Commerce Services,
enabled small businesses to unlock ad revenue with PayPal Ads Manager, and integrated
crypto within PayPal P2P.

For the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect:
  - Transaction margin dollars of $4.02B to $4.12B, representing 2% to 5% growth or 4%
    to 6% growth excluding interest on customer balances
  - Non-GAAP EPS of $1.27 to $1.31, or 7% to 10% growth
  - GAAP EPS of $1.23 to $1.27

For the full year 2025, we are raising our guidance for transaction margin dollars and non-
GAAP EPS:
  - Transaction margin dollars of $15.45B to $15.55B, representing 5% to 6% growth or 6%
    to 7% growth excluding interest on customer balances
  - Non-GAAP EPS of $5.35 to $5.39, or 15% to 16% growth
  - GAAP EPS of $5.11 to $5.15
  - Free cash flow of $6B to $7B

We are making tangible progress across the business and strengthening our foundation for
long-term growth. We have the capital to invest in high-impact growth initiatives and are
confident in our ability to execute.

Thank you for your continued interest in PayPal,
Steve and team
