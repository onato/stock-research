DATA SOURCES & METHODOLOGY:
===========================

The data was compiled from Uber's SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q reports) and
verified against:
- Uber's quarterly earnings releases
- Investor presentations
- Annual shareholder letters

Note: Some metrics (Operating Expenses, Operating Income) were not included
because Uber reports these with significant non-GAAP adjustments and
restructuring charges that vary by period. The Adjusted EBITDA metric
provides a more consistent view of operational profitability.

Missing Data Fields:
- Early periods (2020-2022) missing some balance sheet items
- Operating Expenses and Operating Income consistently omitted in favor
  of Adjusted EBITDA

DCF VALUATION READINESS:
========================

The extracted data is suitable for DCF analysis with the following considerations:

Required Inputs Available:
✓ Revenue (all periods)
✓ Net Income (all periods)
✓ Free Cash Flow (recent quarters)
✓ Shareholders' Equity (2023-2024)
✓ Total Debt (2023-2024)
✓ Cash & Equivalents (2023-2024)
✓ Shares Outstanding (all periods)

Calculated Ratios:
- ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
- Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents
- Book Value Per Share = Shareholders' Equity / Shares Outstanding

Growth Metrics:
- Revenue CAGR (2020-2024): ~40% annually
- Recent quarters show decelerating but healthy growth
- Path to sustained profitability established

For DCF modeling, recent periods (2023-2024) provide the most reliable
data points for terminal value calculations given the company's
transition to profitability.
