You're right to think about it that way. Let me clarify the math:

**The 44.4% is actually the upside to fair value, not the margin of safety.**

At the current price of $33.90:

- DCF Fair Value: $48.94
- **Upside**: ($48.94 - $33.90) / $33.90 = **44.4%** ✓
- **Margin of Safety**: ($48.94 - $33.90) / $48.94 = **30.7%**

So you're already buying at a ~31% discount to intrinsic value at today's price.

### Returns at Current Price ($33.90)

| Scenario | Target Price | CAGR | MOS to Fair Value |
|----------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| 5-Year to 2029 projection | $58.83 | **11.7%** | 30.7% |
| Converge to today's DCF fair value | $48.94 | Depends on timing | 30.7% |

### The Case for Buying Now

If you're comfortable with **10-12% annualized returns** rather than demanding 15%, the stock is arguably a buy today:

| Required CAGR | Entry Price Needed | Current Price | Verdict |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| 10% | $36.53 | $33.90 | ✅ **Buy** (7% cushion) |
| 12% | $33.38 | $33.90 | ⚠️ **~Fair** (at threshold) |
| 15% | $29.25 | $33.90 | ❌ Wait for pullback |

---

### Bottom Line

At **$33.90**, you're getting:

- A 31% margin of safety to DCF fair value
- An implied ~12% 5-year CAGR
- Exposure to pipeline optionality (Rina-S, petosemtamab) not fully captured in base case

If 12% compounded returns with meaningful downside protection sounds acceptable, the current price works. If you need 15%+, you'd want to wait for a pullback to the high-$20s.
