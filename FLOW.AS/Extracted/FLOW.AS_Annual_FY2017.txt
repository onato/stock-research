The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants who together make ETP investing and trading possible. These include:
investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act as liquidity providers,
such as Flow Traders. The ETP ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the primary market and the secondary market.

into their positions after a number of years working with the
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them.

Remuneration
We reward our uniquely skilled employees with an attractive
combination of fixed and variable pay. When awarding
variable compensation, we look beyond an employee’s
individual results or direct area of responsibility. The variable
pay element depends on company performance, individual
performance, and how an employee contributed to the
long-term success of the company as a whole. We use this
compensation structure as an important tool to stimulate
team work and risk awareness and to reward performance.
For example, awarding variable remuneration and payment
of deferred variable remuneration depends on the future

The remuneration of our Management Board members
consists of a relatively modest fixed base salary and
a variable, partially deferred, remuneration in cash.
The table below shows the total remuneration awarded to
the individual members of the Management Board over
2017.
