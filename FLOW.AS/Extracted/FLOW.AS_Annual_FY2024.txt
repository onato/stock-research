Celebrating 20 years                “In 2024, we proudly celebrated Flow Traders' 20th anniversary, this
                                    was an incredible milestone for our firm, our people, and our trusted
                                    partners. This year has been groundbreaking, showcasing the
                                    strength of our business model, the resilience of our team, and our
                                    commitment to innovation in global financial markets.

                                    I am immensely proud of what we achieved in 2024. We delivered a
                                    strong financial performance, seizing emerging market
                                    opportunities and capitalizing on volatility. Beyond the financials,
                                    this year marked significant strides in advancing our strategic and
                                    commercial agenda, including the introduction of our Trading
                                    Capital Expansion Plan, which is a pivotal step in ensuring Flow
                                    Traders' long-term growth.

                                    More broadly, we strongly believe we stand at a transformative
                                    moment in financial markets, operating at the intersection of
                                    traditional finance (TradFi) and digital asset markets. The shift
                                    towards a 24/7 trading environment is shaping the global financial
                                    landscape, and Flow Traders is uniquely positioned to lead this
                                    evolution. Our leading role in ETP trading, robust distribution
                                    network, strong pricing capabilities, and position as a first mover in
                                    digital assets equip us to drive growth.

                                    Our mission remains clear: to contribute to making global financial
                                    markets more transparent and efficient, ultimately reducing
                                    transaction costs, and increasing accessibility for all market
                                    participants. As digital assets continue to disrupt financial markets,
                                    we see immense potential for traditional and digital asset
                                    ecosystems to co-exist, complementing each other to create a more
                                    inclusive financial ecosystem.

                                    To our partners and counterparties, thank you for your unwavering
                                    support and collaboration. Together, we are paving the way for a
                                    more innovative and inclusive financial system.”

Our role in the ETP ecosystem

As a global liquidity provider we operate between both the primary and secondary markets. By providing continuous liquidity, we play a crucial role in ensuring that ETPs
and other financial instruments can be traded efficiently. This reduces trading costs and improves overall market accessibility for market participants.

The securities market is accessible to registered participants, including broker-dealers and market makers. Investors place orders with broker-dealers, who route them to
exchanges or market makers for execution. As a market maker, we provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices, facilitating trades with counterparties. Once a trade is
confirmed, clearing houses handle the settlement, ensuring secure transfer of assets and payments. Acting as a liquidity provider, we maintain a market-neutral position,
with performance unaffected by market price direction.

Rotation Schedule
Any changes in the composition of the Board require
careful consideration from a succession planning           Board skills and expertise matrix
perspective. In making nominations to the General
Meeting of Shareholders for the election of directors
to the Board, the Board tries to mitigate the potential
future risk of directors simultaneously retiring. The
Board rotation schedule, which gives a clear insight
into each director's term(s) is available our website.

Gender diversity within the Board
We aim to incorporate diversity aspects such as
nationality, age, gender, educational background or
professional background into decision making
concerning the composition of our workforce.
Regardless of rules and regulations, we see diversity
as a means to guarantee a safe and inclusive
environment for our employees and to optimize
balanced decision making. To the extent possible,
these aims also apply to the composition of our             *Was a former executive board member of (listed) international company.

Board. The current composition of the Board is
diverse in terms of gender, nationality and expertise,
and has a suitable level of experience in the financial,
economic, trading, technology, social and legal
aspects of a Company like ours. Specifically with
respect to gender diversity within the Board, we have
set the following goals: (i) to have at least 1/3 female
and 1/3 male Non-Executive Directors and (ii) at least
one female and at least one male Executive Director.
During the year 2024 we were able to continue
meeting our gender diversity goals, as is reflected in
the following table.

The Non-Executive Directors of the Board have
determined that the six KPIs used to assess
Executive Director performance in 2024 will be
retained for the 2025 performance year. The specific

commercially sensitive and accordingly the target

will be disclosed retrospectively together with
appropriate commentary in the next Annual Report.
The weighting of the Company versus individual
targets will remain at 70% versus 30%.

Clawback variable remuneration
Malus and clawback provisions are in place that are
comprehensive, irreversible and substantially exceed
regulatory requirements. No variable remuneration
has been clawed back during 2024.


Temporary deviations from the
Remuneration Policy
No temporary deviations took place from the
respective policy in 2024.


Shares held by employees and Executive
Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging
management and employee share ownership,
creating alignment between the Company’s long-
term success and individual personal financial
circumstances. Since IPO, we have utilized a number
of share schemes. In connection with the IPO a
significant number of current and former employees
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow
Traders Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders
Loyalty Incentive Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The
FCIP was replaced in 2020 by a new share plan which
provides for the award up to 50% of variable
remuneration in shares (or share-like instruments).

The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in
respect of the following transactions:


▪   derivatives;
▪   sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪   securities lending and borrowing.



The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable
securities as set out in notes 18 and 27 in respect of derivatives (including swaps).
Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities received/
granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction,
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each
party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure
to post collateral.


Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include:
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to offset liabilities against
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event of
the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure.
However, the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 are not met in all cases.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024   163
This document contains "forward-looking statements" that relate to without limitation, our plans, objectives,
strategies, anticipated developments in the industry in which we operate, and future operational performance.
These forward-looking statements are often identified by terms such as "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend,"
"plan," "predict," "may," "will," "would," "should," "continue," "expect," and similar expressions, though not exclusively.
Such forward-looking statements are to involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important
factors that could cause circumstances or actual outcomes, results, performance, or achievements to differ
materially from any future circumstances, results, performance or achievements expressed or implied. Key factors
that may affect these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: reduced levels of overall trading
volumes and lower margins; dependence on prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading counterparties, central
counterparties (CCPs), and custodians; potential loss of access to important exchange or other trading venues;
occurrence of systemic market events; incurrence of trading losses; disruptions or failures of our trading platform or
third-party technical infrastructure; operational risks and challenges inherent to our business and trading activities;
ineffective risk management systems processes and strategies; intense industry competition; reliance on
continuous access to liquidity sources; capacity constraints in computer and communication systems; dependence
on third-party software, infrastructure, or software availability; damage to our reputation and the reputation of our
industry; loss of key staff or failure to attract and loss of key personnel or challenges in attracting and retaining
skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory requirements; compliance with applicable laws and
regulations specific to our industry; and enhanced media and regulatory scrutiny affecting public perception
among other risks. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, beliefs, and expectations derived
from our industry experience, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future
developments, and other factors we deem appropriate. Furthermore, any sustainability-related statements—
pertaining to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations—are based on the best evidence and
information available to us at the time of this report. These statements, including those regarding future
opportunities or risks, are inherently uncertain and subject to change as our understanding of ESG factors evolves.
From a quantitative perspective, some of our sustainability metrics, such as emissions calculations, rely on estimates
and external sources, including conversion factors. These estimates are based on current methodologies and
sources, which may vary, leading to potential adjustments in reported figures over time. As such, the figures
presented in this report should be understood as estimates that could change depending on the data sources or
methods employed. While we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking and sustainability
statements are reasonable as of the date they are made, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Therefore, you are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange
regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or
sustainability metrics, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any forward-looking
statements should not be interpreted as guarantees of future performance or outcomes. If the risks or uncertainties
materialize, or if the assumptions underlying our forward -looking statements prove inaccurate, our actual
operational results, financial condition or sustainability outcomes could differ significantly from those anticipated,
believed, estimated or expected. Statements regarding the market, industry trends, including the FX market,
developments in ETP Assets under Management in specific markets, ETP value traded in certain markets and Flow
Traders’ competitive position, are based on external data and sources. As these sources and methodologies evolve,
so too may the information we present.
