Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
ETNs are types of unsecured, unsubordinated debt
securities issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of
ETNs are based on the performance of the index being
tracked. For example, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term
Futures Index TR ETN would track the S&P 500 VIX
Short-Term Futures volatility index.


The ETP ecosystem

who together make ETP investing and trading possible.
These include investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other

◾   the continuing shift to global electronic trading, which
    cuts costs and maximizes efficiency and transparency;
◾   a shift in asset growth from active strategies to more
    cost-effective, passive strategies;
◾   increasing ETP adoption globally among institutions,
    intermediaries and retail investors;
◾   long-term shifts driven by regulators looking to
    increase financial stability and transparency.
To take advantage of this expected growth, we aim to
expand our presence further in all areas of ETP trading in all
regions.

Shared value

Flow Traders was founded more than 15 years ago, and in
that time we have developed an innovative and
entrepreneurial spirit that enables us to grow and explore
new markets. We recognize that with this growth come
responsibilities that go beyond our core business, and that
our activities influence the society in which we live and
operate.


At the same time, society has a very real impact on our
business and operations. Both the Management Board and
the Supervisory Board pay close attention to a wide variety
of developments and trends that could pose either a risk or
an opportunity. One example is the geopolitical risk that
could accompany a no-deal Brexit. Another is the
opportunity that comes with the shift to digitalization, which
is helping make financial products and services more widely
available to investors across society.

Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests
by external experts. We have a comprehensive IT security
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both
from inside and outside the platform. Where we have
a technical interface with institutions like our prime brokers

systems and the data that is being exchanged is subject to
prior conformance testing and continuous monitoring.
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated.
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which,
for instance, provides that each office acts as a back-up site
for other offices.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.


The Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime brokers,
is monitored on a daily basis.
