On the cost side, we maintained a firm discipline on costs
with fixed operating expenses amounting to €58.9 million in
the first six months of 2021 (H1 2020: €54.7 million).
The main drivers of the increase in fixed expenses were
technology investments to support diversification initiatives
and efficiency improvements as well as new hires. There was
€1.3 million of non-recurring expenses in H1 2021 (H1 2020:
€1.5 million), as we continued to incur costs in relation to the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Variable compensation
reduced to €58.1 million in H1 2021 (H1 2020: €205.9 million)
which reflects the overall financial performance of the
business during the first half.


Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders
demonstrated strong operational leverage once again with
an EBITDA margin of 51% (H1 2020: 64%) and EBITDA of
€119.6 million (H1 2020: €464.3 million). Ultimately,
we recorded a Net Profit for H1 2021 of €90.2 million (H1
2020: €375.3 million) with a basic EPS of €2.05 (H1 2020:
€8.25). The interim FY21 dividend has been set at €1.00 per
share (interim FY20 dividend: €4.00 per share).


From a capital perspective, the new IFR/IFD prudential
regime finally came into force on 26 June 2021. The initial
impact has been broadly neutral as lower capital
requirements have been partially offset by growth in
business activities which are more capital intensive. Our own
funds requirement increased to €271 million as at 30 June
2021 compared to €218 million as at 31 December 2020. This
is due to the nature of the overall trading book at this point
in time. Overall, we maintained a strong capital position with
€178 million of excess capital at the end of the half-year.

Related party transactions
As some of Flow Traders’ Supervisory Board members sit on the board of the Flow Traders
Foundation (“Foundation”), the foundation is considered a related party.


During 2020 Flow Traders established the Flow Traders Foundation, a Charity or Foundation
(“Stichting”) to better structure its historic engagement in giving to others in society who need
(financial) help. During 2020 Flow Traders has put in place the funding to make sure that
a significant financial basis has been laid so that the Foundation has the financial means to
make not only an annual but also a structural impact and meets its purpose.


The contribution in the first half year of 2021 was for a total value of €0.3 million (2020: nil) and
related to the Multiyear right to appoint charities the Foundation supports as the main shirt
sponsor of a Dutch professional football club. Furthermore, 60,000 Flow Traders NV shares for
a total value of €2.0 million and a cash donation of €0.5 million were transferred to the
Foundation. These transfers were already accrued for in 2020.
