Societal commitment and charity
It is important for us to back initiatives that contribute to
society. We support a number of charities, not only
financially but also by offering access to the knowledge and
experience that we have available. Our people are
enthusiastic about supporting charitable initiatives, which
has always been part of our working culture. We engage in
the community giving throughout the year, and across our
offices. We do this by supporting Flow Traders employees in
fundraising activities by giving time or access to our network,
by providing guidance to help them have as large an impact
as possible, and by contributing financially.


Next to the individual initiatives of our employees to
contribute to society, we have chosen to focus our 2018
investment in the areas of children’s education and sports.
We believe children should have the ability to learn, get
a quality education (which is the fourth goal on the list of
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals) and to be
able to play sports. The initiatives we support include:
