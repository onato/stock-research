Products

Exchange-traded products (ETPs)
ETPs, the main products that we trade, are often compared
to mutual funds largely because they are both baskets of
shares, bonds, or commodities. However, that is where the
similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds, the majority of
ETPs simply track an index without trying to outperform
such indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures rather
than closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, can be
continuously bought and sold on trading venues during
trading hours and off-exchange at all times.


ETPs provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of
underlying assets, ranging from ETPs that replicate the
composition of a particular equity index, to those that
provide investors with exposure to assets in specific sectors
or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also
enable investors to create and manage diversified
investment portfolios in an efficient manner, as well as
enabling them to switch exposures at any given moment
during trading days. There are broadly three main categories
within ETPs in which we trade:


Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to ETCs
and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares or bonds held
in proportion to an index. For example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF
would hold the same shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index,
in approximately the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments.
For example, bonds included in the Barclays US Treasury 1-3
Year Term Index. ETFs are the most widespread among ETPs
as measured by Assets under Management (AuM).

Anyone with a good idea, in their own area of expertise or
another, is encouraged to share. This is part of the open,
informal and diverse culture that makes us who we truly are.


Nurturing our culture
Maintaining, preserving and nurturing our culture is
extremely important to everyone across the organization.
This is done by the Management Board through the
organization of firm-wide events and company outings as
well regular all-staff updates. Colleagues themselves also
reinforce the strength of our culture by organizing their own
events, competitions and charitable endeavors.


Outstanding behavior in 2021
There have been many individual examples of outstanding
behavior which has reinforced Flow Traders’ strong culture.
An example which is worth highlighting - various colleagues
continue to give up their valuable spare time to assist with
the ongoing operation of the Flow Traders Foundation.

Management and control

Our global capital position is managed on a daily and
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Office department.
The Risk and Mid-Office department checks our positions
and capital posted at every prime broker for correctness and
compares these numbers with the relevant prime broker or
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance
department prepares a rolling 15-month forecast for our
capital positions, every month.


As part of our regulatory capital management cycle, the Risk
and Mid-Office departments prepare a daily report that
shows all the group’s positions and capital versus the
regulatory capital requirements. At the end of every quarter
the company and Flow Traders B.V. report their capital
requirements and corresponding coverage to the Dutch
Central Bank.


A final part of the internal risk management and capital
cycle is the annual Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy
Assessment Process (ICLAAP). The ICLAAP comprises
a review of prevalent risks, the capital management
processes, the risk management framework and an
assessment of capital adequacy and liquidity and is reported
to the Dutch Central Bank annually. The Dutch Central Bank
assesses the capital adequacy based on this report.

      Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, Chief Trading Officer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology Officer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP plan rules they were offered the
       opportunity to buy Company shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a five-year period. The right to these incentives would have been forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and becoming a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However,
       special permission has been granted to both Management Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the shares bought under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow Traders rather than a member of
       the Management Board. As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash incentive.

Comparative overview of company performance and
remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our policy is a relatively
modest base salary and variable remuneration that is
aligned with company performance – therefore varying
considerably in successful and less successful (financial)
years. This is clearly illustrated in the table below which
shows the development of the company performance and
the average (full-time) remuneration of executives and
employees since Flow Traders’ IPO in 2015.

 The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the

 amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of
 default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other
 predetermined events.


 In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realize
 the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
