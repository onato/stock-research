                                             Introduction
                                             We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of
                                             Flow Traders N.V., Amsterdam, as set out on pages 10 to 22, that comprise the condensed
                                             consolidated statement of financial position as at June 30, 2016, the condensed consolidated
                                             statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
                                             flows for the six month period then ended and the notes, comprising a summary of the
                                             significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Management is responsible
                                             for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated interim financial
                                             statements in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European
                                             Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim
                                             financial statements based on our review.


                                             Scope
                                             We conducted our review in accordance with Dutch law including Standard 2410, Review of
                                             Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of
                                             interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
                                             financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review
                                             is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Dutch auditing
                                             standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become
                                             aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
                                             express an audit opinion.


                                             Conclusion
                                             Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
                                             accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the six month
                                             period ended June 30, 2016 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34,
                                             Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union.
