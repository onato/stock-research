markets and products. We aim to grow our global teams,
while remaining agile and flexible. We operate in markets
that are heavily regulated, and focusing on compliance will
continue to be key to our success. But we also see opportu-
nities elsewhere. Becoming a public company has given us
greater exposure, and we believe that transparency about
what we do is vital in creating greater market understanding.
We want to continue to be proactive in this area.

participants can create ETPs with the issuer by transferring
the underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the issuer in
return for a corresponding number of newly issued ETPs.
This increases the ETP’s assets under management. In this
way, the issuance of ETPs through authorized participants
provides the issuers with access to a broad investor market

infrastructure which would be non-core to their business.
Redemption is the reverse of the creation process: the
authorized participant transfers ETPs to their issuer in
exchange for the underlying assets (or a cash equivalent).
The issuer then cancels the ETPs it received. This decreases
the ETP’s assets under management.

The secondary market is where ETP trading takes place
between market participants, similar to the trading of
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. Secondary
market participants include institutional and retail investors,
and liquidity providers and authorized participants.

assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience.
This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements
about future events. new information may become available that causes the Group to change
its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities
will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.


deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority
on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized
simultaneously.


a deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which they can be utilized. deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.


The Group’s cash position as well as the other available in credit lines with prime brokers is
monitored on a daily basis.
