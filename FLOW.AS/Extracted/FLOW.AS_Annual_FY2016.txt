In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and
correlated, and reflects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation
confirms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented
under Market risk.


Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

If a firm fails to maintain the required capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation or
registration by the applicable regulatory agency, and suspension or expulsion by these
regulators could ultimately lead to the Group’s liquidation. Additionally, these rules may have
the effect of prohibiting a proprietary trading firm from distributing or withdrawing capital and
requiring prior notice to and approval from DNB for certain capital withdrawals.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing,
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information
or specific items.


We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in
internal control that we identify during our audit.


We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where
applicable, related safeguards.


From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circum-
stances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
