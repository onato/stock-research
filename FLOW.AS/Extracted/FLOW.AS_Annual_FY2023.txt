Growth and talent
We continued to grow our global presence, trading
strategies and infrastructure in 2023. We increased
our institutional counterparty base globally to over
2,400 as well as being connected to over 180 trading
venues. To facilitate this growth, we continued to
recruit new talent throughout the year across all
segments of our business while keeping costs and
headcount under control, ending the year with 646
FTE (2022: 660).


Outlook
Looking ahead to 2024, normalized fixed operating
expenses are expected to be in the same range as
2023 as headcount is expected to be flat to down for
the year, offset by continued technology
investments and inflationary pressures.

Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management
Framework (ERMF) forms the foundation of
our approach to managing risks. The ERMF is
documented in Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk
Management Policy and is reviewed
annually by our Board.

Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor,
quantify and document potential risks which are
inherent to trading in an automated market-making
firm. In the fast and dynamic environment of
automated trading we designed our ERMF in such a
way that it is robust, efficient and transparent. In the
figure below, we present the stakeholders that have
an interest and place value in how our framework
operates.


Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate
systems and controls including the management of
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a
consistent, continuous and careful method for
addressing, managing and prioritizing our key risks
in the context of our Company’s strategic objectives.

Risk Management Governance

The effectiveness of risk management is unavoidably
linked to commitment and integrity. It is therefore
crucial that the Board, the Executive Committee,
global and local department heads, and all Flow
Traders employees are aware of the Company's risk
policies, Risk Appetite and their own responsibilities,
as well as the responsibilities of Flow Traders as a
whole. Flow Traders Risk Management is embedded
across the organization in line with the three lines of
defense model.


The first line of defense is formed by Trading,
Technology and Operations. These departments are
crucial for the core processes within Flow Traders
and are responsible for incorporating controls in the
day to day trading and IT processes and for the
continuous monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and
trading controls including onboarding of new
counterparties.


The second line of defense is responsible for
oversight and monitoring regarding regarding risk
(market and credit risk, treasury, and operational
management) compliance (including trading,
regulatory, surveillance and AML KYC), legal and
finance; together are responsible for the continuous
risk management at Flow Traders.


The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’
Internal Audit Function (IAF). They provide
independent and objective assurance and advice on
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk
management and control systems. It reports its
findings to the Audit Committee and to the CEO to
promote and facilitate continuous improvement.
The IAF carries out its audit work in accordance with
the approved and implemented Group Internal Audit
Charter.

The annual Risk Management Cycle follows
the below Risk Management Framework:
Every year the Executive Directors, with the support
of the Executive Committee, set their business
targets following the strategic goals. The strategic
goals are generally formulated in November/
December. The Board approves the strategic goals
and business targets.


Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals,
short-term targets are determined. These targets are
then translated into annual Company-wide,
departmental and individual goals and discussed in
an annual meeting with the Executive Committee
and all relevant regional Operational Committees
and the Board.


Based on the targets, objectives and current
business operations, the Executive Directors
formulate the risk appetite of the Company. The
targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to
the various departments within Flow Traders and are
used to derive the Company’s strategic risks.


Flow Traders’ Risk Management Cycle is
implemented to manage our residual risk profile to
remain in line with our risk appetite. To help achieve
this, we perform Risk Self Assessments to identify
and assess current or emerging risks. Following the
Risk Self Assessments, department heads in
cooperation with the Executive Directors will decide
on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the
chosen risk responses will be monitored and the
actual residual risk profile will be mapped versus the
appetite annually.

Our value chain
Central to our approach in assessing the material ESG topics, is engagement with our value chain partners. We assess the current and potential future impacts, risks and
opportunities from two perspectives: a) impacts resulting from our business activities on our stakeholders (Inside-Out view), and b) impacts resulting from the business
activities from our upstream and downstream value chain on Flow Traders (Outside-In view). When identifying the material topics, we assess each ESG topic on the
most granular level (so-called, sub-sub-topics) to allow focus on areas where impacts, risks and opportunities are likely to arise.

In the past decade, employees and Flow Traders
have supported several initiatives. In 2020, the Flow
Traders Foundation was formalized to continue our
efforts on a broader scale. Our belief has always
been that while providing support is crucial,
whoever initiates a project is in the lead. This has
always been done based on the believe that those
involved should be supported, this approach has
enabled a network of ambassadors within the
organization to work together.


The Foundation supports several long-term
initiatives and in 2023 we supported charities across
our regions and brought to life projects in our
communities.

The Executive Directors also evaluated their own
functioning and performance as a group and
individually, guided by external consultants who are
subject matter experts in respect of Corporate
Governance and leadership effectiveness. In this
context, a 360-degree performance evaluation was
conducted as well. In the 2023 Executive Director
self-assessment, the focus was on the CEO and the
recently joined CFO and it was concluded that the
capabilities and competencies of the Executive
Directors are highly complementary to each other.
Nonetheless, the Executive Directors agreed to
regularly explore opportunities to increase their
bench strength by adding to the capability-set of the
executive team.


Furthermore, the performance of the Executive
Directors was discussed among the Non-Executive
Directors, and with each Executive Director
individually, on at least two separate occasions
throughout the year. For a detailed overview of the
performance reviews and the means by which these
were conducted, reference is made to the
Remuneration Report as included in this Annual
Report.

In addition to a lower total variable remuneration
pool being available in 2023 when compared to
2022, also a lower portion of this has been awarded
to the executives as a result of the performance
assessment, measured against the aforementioned
Company and individual performance criteria. As
such we believe the variable compensation
determined is set at a justified level. Aligned with
our remuneration philosophy and our aim of long-
term value creation, the variable compensation is
partly paid out in equity deferred over multiple
years.

securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, such as loans and
deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the
statement of financial position.


The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for
offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because they create a
right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement that is
enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.


In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net
basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

7. Strategic implications
The outcomes of the materiality assessment serve
as input for the ESG sustainability strategy.
Material ESG sustainability matters are linked to
themes in the ESG sustainability strategy, and the
relevant value drivers for each of those strategic
themes. If new material ESG sustainability matters
are identified, they are added to the ESG
sustainability strategy. If new ESG sustainability
risks are identified, they are included in our risk
inventory and managed in line with our Enterprise
Risk Management Framework. We define
measures to manage the related impacts, risks and
opportunities for each material ESG sustainability
topic, including metrics, targets, policies and
action plans.


8. Results of the 2023 Double Materiality
   Assessment
Initial results of the Double Materiality Assessment,
conducted by a cross-business project team,
ascertained 17 material ESG topics. We have
engaged with our stakeholders in the value chain
to obtain their input. Two amendments were made
after the results from stakeholder validation.


The double materiality matrix including the impact
areas and strategic themes were approved and
signed-off by the Board. The double materiality
matrix, as shown on the right, can be seen with the
material ESG topics contained in the upper two
boxes. No topics were identified which is deemed
material from solely a financial material
perspective.

Our impact areas

We want to grow our business and increase our positive impact while minimizing our negative impacts on the environment and people. When identifying the materiality of each ESG
topic we looked at the area in our value chain where positive or negative impacts, or both are likely to occur and those actors which we have leverage or may be able to exert
influence. By doing this, we keep our focus on the ESG topics where we can have the greatest impact.
