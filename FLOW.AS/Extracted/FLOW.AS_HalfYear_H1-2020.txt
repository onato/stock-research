the increase in variable compensation paid to employees. The increase in variable compen-
sation is also reflected in the increase in other liabilities. The amount of variable compensation
payable is based on the operational profit of the company. The impact of COVID-19 on the
results of the company is discussed in the Financial Overview section of Our Business report.
Included in variable compensation is €3.9 million share-based compensation.
