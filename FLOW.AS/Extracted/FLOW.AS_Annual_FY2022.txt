Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nations (UN) has identified 17 SDGs that
are designed to help bring peace and prosperity for
people and the planet as we work collectively
towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. In 2020 we performed a materiality
analysis to identify our ESG priorities. Based on
these ESG priorities we analyzed the SDGs on
subtarget level, to identify the three SDGs we (can)
have an impact on. In 2022 we will be developing
our ESG strategy to steer towards more positive
impact on these SDGs.

Management and control

Our global capital position is managed on a daily and
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Office
department. The Risk and Mid-Office department
checks our positions and capital posted at every
prime broker for correctness and compares these
numbers with the relevant prime broker or
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance
department prepares a rolling 12-month forecast for
our capital positions, every month.


As part of our regulatory capital management cycle,
the Risk and Mid-Office departments prepare a daily
report that shows all the group’s positions and
capital versus the regulatory capital requirements.
At the end of every quarter the company and Flow
Traders B.V. report their capital requirements and
corresponding coverage to the Dutch Central Bank.


A final part of the internal risk management and
capital cycle is the annual Internal Capital and
Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ICLAAP) for
our largest trading entity, Flow Traders B.V.. The
ICLAAP comprises a review of prevalent risks, the
capital management processes, the risk
management framework and an assessment of
capital adequacy and liquidity and is reported to the
Dutch Central Bank annually. The Dutch Central
Bank assesses the capital adequacy for Flow Traders
B.V. based on this report.

Risk Management Governance
The effectiveness of risk management is linked to
commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that
the Management Board, the global and local
department heads, and all employees are aware of
the risks that the company faces and their
responsibilities in managing it efficiently.


Our risk management is organised along three lines
of defence.


The first line of defence is comprised of Trading,
Technology and Operations. These departments are
critical for managing the core processes within Flow
Traders and are responsible for incorporating
preventive and detective controls in the day-to-day
trading and IT processes and for the continuous
monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and trading
controls.


The second line of defence is responsible for
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and
requirements. Risk Management, Compliance and
Finance manage risks through a combination of
preventive and detective controls. Together they are
responsible for the continuous risk management of
Flow Traders.


The third line of defence is formed by Flow Traders’
Internal Audit Function (IAF). They provide
independent and objective assurance and advice on
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk
management and control systems. It achieves this
through the competent application of systematic and
disciplined processes, expertise, and insight. It
reports its findings to management and the
governing body to promote and facilitate continuous
improvement. The IAF carries out its audit work in
accordance with the approved and implemented
Group Internal Audit Charter.

Changes for 2023

As a result of a thorough legal and capital structure
review and to support our aims in becoming more
competitive as a global multi-asset liquidity provider,
we completed an update to our corporate holding
structure which includes a top holding company in
Bermuda. We have retained our existing global
footprint with no change to day-to-day operations.
This includes a substantial presence in the
Netherlands as well as maintaining a listing on
Euronext Amsterdam.


Our Board remuneration shareholder approval
requirements remain unchanged through the holding
structure changes. We continue to uphold the
requirement to obtain 75% of shareholder approval
for our Board remuneration policy which will be put
to a vote at the 2023 AGM.


Following the updates to our holding structure, as
required by Bermuda law, the top holding company
now has a one-tier Board, comprised of executive
and non-executive directors, including an
independent Chairman.


On behalf of the Committee, I thank all shareholders
for their constructive feedback, and we are looking
forward to continuing our dialogue in 2023.

1.As shareholders have not approved to award actual shares, members of the Management Board receive share-like instruments.
2. Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, Chief Trading Officer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology Officer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP
plan rules they were offered the opportunity to buy Company shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a five-year period. The right to these incentives would have been forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and
becoming a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However, special permission has been granted to both Management Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the
shares bought under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow Traders rather than a member of the Management Board. As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash incentive.
3. Thomas Wolff stepped down as member of the Management Board as of 29 April 2022. The remuneration granted in capacity as CTO is shown in the table above. Given the resignation, the deferred cash award granted in 2021 in
the amount of €200,000 has been forfeited. No variable remuneration has been granted in 2022.
4. Britta Achmann stepped down as member of the Management Board as of 30 November 2022. The remuneration granted in capacity as CRO is shown in the table above. Given the resignation the share-like instruments awarded in
2022 were forfeited and only 25% of the unvested share-like instruments of the prior year grants will vest before the vesting date.

determined that the six KPIs used to assess
executive director performance in 2022 will be
retained for the 2023 performance year. The specific
targets relating to each of these KPIs are
commercially sensitive and accordingly the target

will be disclosed retrospectively together with

Deferral and vesting of variable pay

We believe in creating a culture of ownership, risk
awareness and entrepreneurial spirit and we
embrace an approach which truly connects our
people to the business in sharing profit and risk. To
ensure that the variable remuneration award of the
Management Board is aligned with our beliefs and
contributes to long-term value creation and
shareholder experience, 50% of the 2022 award to
the Management Board is paid out in share-like
instruments deferred over multiple years. This
approach allows us to take a longer-term outlook on
remuneration. The remaining 50% is settled in cash,
paid in equal instalments in 2023 and 2024. As
shareholders have not approved granting awards
over Flow Traders’ equity as part of the Management
Board’s remuneration, we have utilized share-like
instruments for the equity portion, which will be
settled in cash at time of vesting. The value of these
instruments is directly linked to performance of the
Flow Traders’ share price from the date of grant to
vesting. Further, any outstanding variable
remuneration (deferred or unvested) remains at risk
in full for future years. All equity-based awards are
subject to a holding period of one-year post-vesting.
These accord with our culture and remuneration
philosophy of encouraging management and
employee share ownership, creating alignment with
the company’s long-term success.

arrangements.


Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities, the Group is required

our Asian operations they require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%,
calculated by shareholders equity divided by credit limit.

counterparty’s failure to post collateral.


Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include:
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set-off liabilities against
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event
of the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit
exposure. However, the offsetting criteria in IFRS 9 are not met in all cases.
