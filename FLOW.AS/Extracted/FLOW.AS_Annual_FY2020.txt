◾   We promote fair, transparent and orderly markets
◾   We promote competition on a level playing field
◾   We comply with all rules and regulations
◾   We subscribe to fair taxation and transparent reporting
◾   We are open, informal and diverse
◾   We want colleagues to take ownership,
    be entrepreneurial and be team players
◾   We reward responsibility, performance and initiatives
    that benefit the firm as a whole
◾   We always give back to society and the communities we
    live in


These values are a reflection of the things we believe in.
And they shape our culture. We believe that how you
perform is more important than what you wear. So our
employees dress comfortably for work – jeans, t-shirts and
sneakers are common. We believe that what someone says
is more important than who says it. We believe that the
contributions of our team-members are crucial to the
success of the company. We believe that two people know
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in
areas different to their core expertise. Which is why we
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions.
Anyone with a good idea, in their own area of expertise or
another, is encouraged to share. This is part of the open,
informal and diverse culture that makes us who we truly are.


Nurturing our culture
Maintaining, preserving and nurturing our culture is
extremely important to everyone across the organization.
This is done by the Management Board through the
organization of firm-wide events and company outings as
well regular all-staff updates. Colleagues themselves also
reinforce the strength of our culture by organizing their own
events, competitions and charitable endeavors.

      Britta Achmann was appointed to the Management Board at the AGM on 24 June 2020 but has been employed by the company since 1 February 2020. Her base salary for 2020 is shown as pro rata for her start date.

      Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, Chief Trading Officer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology Officer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP plan rules they were offered the
      opportunity to buy Company shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a five year period. The right to these incentives would have been forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and becoming a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However,
      special permission has been granted to both Management Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the shares bought under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow Traders rather than a member of
      the Management Board. As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash incentive.

Changes in regulation
Remuneration regulations are subject to change. Currently,
the European Commission, European Parliament and
European member states are negotiating implementing
regulations pertaining to new prudential requirement
including remuneration requirements for investment firms
(IFR/IFD) which may affect our Dutch trading entity and our
Group. We expect more certainty about the outcome during
the course early 2021. We continuously monitor such
changes but currently cannot assess in full what the exact
implementation or impact of such changes will be. Changes
may have a significant impact on the General Remuneration
Policy, our global remuneration model and other
remuneration practices of the company and its group
companies. It may also impact our ability to attract or retain
talent given the global and highly competitive nature of our
industry.

use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs
and income tax expense.


The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be
committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year
from the date of the classification.
