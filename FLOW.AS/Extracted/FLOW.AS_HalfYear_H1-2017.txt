Scope
We conducted our review in accordance with Dutch law including Standard 2410, Review of
Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of
interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Dutch auditing
standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.
