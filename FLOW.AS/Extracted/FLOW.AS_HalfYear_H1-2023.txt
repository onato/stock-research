Stakeholder expectations and
materiality analysis
As a first step towards the creation of our ESG
strategy, we performed a materiality analysis to
identify the ESG related issues that should be our
main areas of focus. Based on internal and external
developments we determined a shortlist of relevant
topics. To determine the priority of the relevant
topics we first launched a stakeholder consultation
process to identify the ESG related issues that
various stakeholders believe should be our main
areas of focus, through a survey. Flow Traders has
had the feedback from a wide selection of
stakeholders, including shareholders, counterparties
and issuers and employees. These stakeholders
were selected because Flow Traders directly
influences their interests. These Flow Traders’
stakeholders recognize that we play a role in ESG
from numerous standpoints: Flow Traders as a
participant in the financial markets ecosystem, Flow
Traders as a business providing services and as a
corporate actor. In each of these roles, Flow Traders
has different responsibilities. A consultation was held
with internal management to prioritize the issues
with which Flow Traders can have the most
economic, environmental and societal impact and
our ESG reporting and KPIs reflect this.

The outcomes of the stakeholder and management
prioritization is presented in the materiality matrix
below which was validated by both the Board,
helped us determine our ESG priorities. The x-axis
represents the prioritization by internal management
and the y-axis the prioritization by stakeholders. On
the basis of the materiality matrix Flow Traders has
identified 9 key issues, of which five are considered
highly material.

derive its business targets after determining its strategic goals. Based on these targets and objectives, the Executive Directors of The Board formulate its risk appetite.
The targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to the various departments within the Company and are used to derive our strategic risks. We deliver on the risk
activities set out in our annual Risk Management cycle to ensure that the residual risk profile is (and remains) in line with our set risk appetite. In order to achieve this,
we perform risk control self-assessments (RCSAs) to assess current risks and identify risks that have newly arisen. Following the RCSAs, the Executive Directors of The
Board decide on the appropriate risk response.

Risk Management Governance
The effectiveness of risk management is linked to
commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that
the Board, the global and local department heads,
and all employees are aware of the risks that the
Company faces and their responsibilities in
managing it efficiently.


Our risk management is organised along three lines
of defence.


The first line of defence is comprised of Trading,
Technology and Operations. These departments are
critical for managing the core processes within Flow
Traders and are responsible for incorporating
preventive and detective controls in the day-to-day
trading and IT processes and for the continuous
monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and trading
controls.


The second line of defence is responsible for
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and
requirements. Risk Management, Compliance and
Finance manage risks through a combination of
preventive and detective controls. Together they are
responsible for the continuous risk management of
Flow Traders.


The third line of defence is formed by Flow Traders’
Internal Audit function (IA). They provide
independent and objective assurance and advice on
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk
management and control systems. It achieves this
through the competent application of systematic and
disciplined processes, expertise, and insight. It
reports its findings to management and the
governing body to promote and facilitate continuous
improvement. The IA carries out its audit work in
accordance with the approved and implemented
Group Internal Audit Charter.

The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial
liabilities that:
▪   are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
▪   are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar
    agreement that covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether
    they are offset in the statement of financial position.

The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master
repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements.
Similar financial instruments include derivatives, sales and repurchase

Offsetting


The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include:
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set-off liabilities against
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event
of the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit
exposure. However, the offsetting criteria in IFRS 9 are not met in all cases.

subject to consolidated capital requirements under the EU Directive Investment
Firm Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firm Directive (IFD). Regulated Flow

monitored by their respective National Competency Authority (NCA).


The Board monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to
shareholders while complying with prime broker and regulatory capital
requirements. The available capital in the trading companies is monitored on a
daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all times and sufficient
capital is available to support the Group’s strategy. Trading capital as at 30
June 2023 was €574.6 million (30 June 2023 €610.7 million).
