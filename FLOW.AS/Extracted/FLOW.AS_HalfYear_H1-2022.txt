Based on the targets and objectives, the Management Board
formulates the risk appetite of the company. The targets,
objectives and risk appetite give direction to the various
departments within Flow Traders and are used to derive the
company’s strategic risks.


Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is implemented to
ensure that the net risk profile is and stays in line with the
set risk appetite. To do so, we perform Risk Self
Assessments to identify and assess current and newly arisen
risks. Following the Risk Self Assessments, department
heads in cooperation with the Management Board will
decide on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the
chosen risk responses will be monitored and every year the
actual net risk profile will be mapped versus the appetite.
