7. Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS
is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary
shareholders with the number of ordinary shares outstanding.


The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted
average effect of changes in treasury shares (repurchased and re-issued by the
Group) during the period.


Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per
share for the effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025   58
This document contains "forward-looking statements" that relate to without limitation, our plans, objectives,
strategies, anticipated developments in the industry in which we operate, and future operational performance.
These forward-looking statements are often identified by terms such as "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend,"
"plan," "predict," "may," "will," "would," "should," "continue," "expect," and similar expressions, though not exclusively.
Such forward-looking statements are to involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important
factors that could cause circumstances or actual outcomes, results, performance, or achievements to differ
materially from any future circumstances, results, performance or achievements expressed or implied. Key factors
that may affect these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: reduced levels of overall trading
volumes and lower margins; dependence on prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading counterparties, central
counterparties (CCPs), and custodians; potential loss of access to important exchange or other trading venues;
occurrence of systemic market events; incurrence of trading losses; disruptions or failures of our trading platform or
third-party technical infrastructure; operational risks and challenges inherent to our business and trading activities;
ineffective risk management systems processes and strategies; intense industry competition; reliance on
continuous access to liquidity sources; capacity constraints in computer and communication systems; dependence
on third-party software, infrastructure, or software availability; damage to our reputation and the reputation of our
industry; loss of key staff or failure to attract and loss of key personnel or challenges in attracting and retaining
skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory requirements; compliance with applicable laws and
regulations specific to our industry; and enhanced media and regulatory scrutiny affecting public perception
among other risks. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, beliefs, and expectations derived
from our industry experience, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future
developments, and other factors we deem appropriate. Furthermore, any sustainability-related statements—
pertaining to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations—are based on the best evidence and
information available to us at the time of this report. These statements, including those regarding future
opportunities or risks, are inherently uncertain and subject to change as our understanding of ESG factors evolves.
From a quantitative perspective, some of our sustainability metrics, such as emissions calculations, rely on estimates
and external sources, including conversion factors. These estimates are based on current methodologies and
sources, which may vary, leading to potential adjustments in reported figures over time. As such, the figures
presented in this report should be understood as estimates that could change depending on the data sources or
methods employed. While we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking and sustainability
statements are reasonable as of the date they are made, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Therefore, you are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange
regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or
sustainability metrics, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any forward-looking
statements should not be interpreted as guarantees of future performance or outcomes. If the risks or uncertainties
materialize, or if the assumptions underlying our forward -looking statements prove inaccurate, our actual
operational results, financial condition or sustainability outcomes could differ significantly from those anticipated,
believed, estimated or expected. Statements regarding the market, industry trends, including the FX market,
developments in ETP Assets under Management in specific markets, ETP value traded in certain markets and Flow
Traders’ competitive position, are based on external data and sources. As these sources and methodologies evolve,
so too may the information we present.
